Josimoviƒá was arguably the first modern Serbian urbanist and the first modern professor of architecture in Serbia.https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/286913989.pdf Biography=The family Emilijan Josimoviƒá was born in 1823 in the town of Moldova (now Romania), in the Serbian family of border lieutenant Josimoviƒá. He had one older brother and two younger ones. Jovan the older brother was engaged in trade and cooperated with Mi≈°a Anastasijeviƒá, who helped in Emilijan's schooling, considering that his father died early on. Emilijan married twice. First, Emilija, the daughter of Vasilije Laziƒá, and he had three children with her: a daughter Anka and two sons, Nikola and Milivoj. After Emilia's death, Emilijan married ≈Ωivka, with whom he left Belgrade in 1887. The married couple lived first in ≈†opiƒá, near Lazarevac, and later in Sokobanja, where Emilian died on 25 May 1897. name=\\"–Ω–∞—à –ø—Ä–≤–∏ –∞—Ä—Ö–∏—Ç–µ–∫—Ç–∞\\"> Education In 1831, Emilijan enrolled in a grammar school in Caransebes. He finished the mathematical military school in Lugoj, and completed his university studies at the University of Vienna, earning a degree in philosophy and technical sciences at the age of 22. Work in education Emilijan Josimoviƒá spent his entire working life dedicated to teaching and designing innovative urban cityscapes. Upon his arrival in Belgrade, on 18 September 1845, he became a part-time professor at the Belgrade Lyceum, where he taught mathematics. He also founded the Technical Society. In the Belgrade Artillery School, where he worked from 1850, first as a part-time professor, and from 1854 to 1869 as a full professor, in addition to mathematics, he also taught mechanics, and then geodesy. He became a full professor at the Grande √©cole on 19 November 1869. There he was the head of the Mathematics Department and then became its rector. He retired from the Grande √©cole (Visoka ≈°kola) which by then was soon-to-become the newly-formed University of Belgrade after 33 years of dedicated educational work. Josimoviƒá wrote university textbooks in Serbia in trigonometry, mathematics, mechanics, geometry, descriptive geometry and perspective, as well as a textbook on civil architecture and road construction.

He became a member of the Society of Serbian Letters, and then of the Royal Serbian Academy. name=\\"—Å–∞–Ω—É\\">He also participated in the founding and work of the first Technical School, the forerunner of the current Association of Technicians and Engineers of Serbia. The most significant work of Emilijan Josimoviƒá is certainly \\"Explanation of the proposal for regulating that part of the city of Belgrade that lies in the trench\\" made from 1864 to 1867, the year when Belgrade officially became a free city when the Turks left. The bold and far-reaching Josimoviƒá plan is referred to as the area of today's narrowest city center. This was at the same time when large construction works were being carried out in other major European cities, such as Haussmann's renovation of Paris and Ildefons Cerd√†'s \\"extension\\" of Barcelona called the Eixample. The first urban plan traced some of the basic axes of today's Belgrade - Knez Mihajlova Street, Tsar Du≈°an, King Peter I avenues. Until then, the streets of Belgrade were mostly winding. The trench was an external fortification whose line can be recognized in the broken routes of today's Kosanƒçiƒá's, Topliƒçin's and Obiliƒá's wreath (circle).Vukotiƒá- Lazar, M.

He started from the fact that the central reservoir should be placed in the highest part of the town, in the Upper Town, while the steam engine would bring water from the Danube, and then it would be distributed from the top of the hill to various parts of the city. However, there was no money or support for his ideas. Adoption of the first urban plan of the old town of Belgrade The centenary of the adoption of the first urban plan of the old core of Belgrade was marked in 1967 with a special exhibition and a ceremonial academy.

Construction  Rastrello was built at the Irvine's Shipbuilding & Drydock Co. Ltd. shipyard in Hartlepool, United Kingdom in January 1904. Where she was launched and completed that same year. The ship was long, had a beam of and had a depth of . She was assessed at and had 1 x 3 cyl. triple expansion engine driving a screw propeller. The ship could reach a maximum speed of 11 knots and could generate 212 n.h.p. thanks to her two boilers.  First World War Capture  Despite being built as the British cargo ship Navarre, Rastrello was sold to Norway for 900.000 NOK in 1911 alongside SS Narbonneand renamed Atle Jarl. She continued serving as a Norwegian ship during the first half of World War I before being captured as a prize by the German submarine U-78 in the North Sea south west of Norway on 21 October 1916, while she was travelling from Trondheim, Norway to Newcastle, United Kingdom with a stop over at Bergen, Norway while carrying general cargo. Rastrello (then Atle Jarl) was taken to Kiel, Germany and used by the Kaiserliche Marine as a headquarters for the defense of Kiel and as an accommodation ship for mine warfare research.  Interbellum and First Sinking  After the war in 1919, Rastrello (at this time still named Atle Jarl) was again used as a cargo ship by the new German government with her home port in Hamburg, Germany. Disaster would strike Rastrello that same year as on 20 November 1919 she sank after hitting a mine near √ñland, Sweden while she was on a voyage from Lule√•, Sweden to Amsterdam, the Netherlands with a cargo of wood. She was refloated on 28 June 1920 and repaired, re-entering to service that same year.  World War II and Final Sinking  Rastrello finally received her name when she was bought by Italy in May 1937 with her new homeport in Genoa, Italy. When World War II broke out in September 1939, Italy found herself allied with Germany and Japan to form the Axis powers which meant that Rastrello would become a potential target for Allied attacks. That feared attack eventually occurred on 16 June 1940 when Rastrello was hit and sunk by bombs during a British air raid on Naples, Italy with no reported loss of life.  Wreck  The wreck of Rastrello was lifted and broken up not long after she sank.

The foundation's stated goal is to make it easier for consumers to eat plant-based more often and also to help companies address the growing demand in plant-based products. ProVeg Nederland is a member of the international ProVeg International.  History  ProVeg Nederland started as an initiative in 2011 under the name Viva Las Vega's, when a group of students (including cofounders Veerle Vrindts, Pablo Moleman and Alex Romijn) organised a vegan festival, the Viva Las Vega's Festival, at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.Ad Valvas, 10 March 2011, photo without title, page 2. A foundation was formally established and the group started to develop other activities. In 2017, Viva Las Vega's decided to commence cooperation with the new umbrella organisation ProVeg International, which also has national offices in Germany (ProVeg Deutschland, known as the Vegetarierbund Deutschland (VEBU) from 1892 to 22 April 2017), Poland (ProVeg Polska), Spain (ProVeg Espa√±a), the United Kingdom (ProVeg UK), South Africa (ProVeg South Africa), China (ProVeg China) and the United States (ProVeg US). For better recognisability, the foundation therefore rebranded itself to ProVeg Nederland from 1 January 2018.  Activities = Effective altruism  The foundation operates according to the principles of effective altruism, meaning that its campaigns are based on research and real impact. The foundation performs is own research and cooperates with other organisations around The Netherlands to increase the effectiveness of vegan campaigning and explore new effective methods.  Festivals and fairs  ProVeg's Vegxperience at the City Gardens Festival Almere 2017. The Viva Las Vega's Food Festival was relocated in 2012 to the De Hallen in downtown Amsterdam and became an annually recurring event. There were also one time events held in Nijmegen and Rotterdam. Since 2016, ProVeg Nederland has been hosting the annual Dutch festival of VeggieWorld in Utrecht, replacing the earlier VLV Food Festivals. The first edition attracted over 7,600 visitors, making it the largest vegan fair in the Netherlands. The 2020 VeggieWorld edition attracted 9,000 visitors. With the travelling exhibition Vegxperience, ProVeg Nederland also participates in other fairs and events. In December 2015, ProVeg organised the first vegan Christmas market in the Netherlands in Rotterdam-Noord under the name \\"Viva Las Vega's Food Festival, Christmas Edition\\", succeeded by the \\"VeggieWorld WinterFair\\" in Expo Haarlemmermeer in December 2017.  VeggieChallenge  During the first festival in 2011, the VeggieChallenge was launched, a challenge to eat less meat for 30 days. Since its inception, over 20,000 people have taken part. In 2013, the foundation and the Nederlandse Vereniging voor Veganisme (NVV) jointly initiated the VeganChallenge, whereby participants try to reduce their consumption of all animal products over the course of a month. The VeganChallenge was organised twice a year; the October 2015 edition had 2,700 participants. Every day people taking part received tips and recipes to cook and eat plant-based meals. Since June 2014, the NVV has continued the VeganChallenge on its own, while VLV and later ProVeg focused on growing the VeggieChallenge. In early 2019, ProVeg Nederland launched a crowdfunding campaign that garnered 15,000 euros develop a free app that allowed people to take up the VeggieChallenge, individually and internationally in any month, using their phones. Before the app's launch on World Vegan Day (1 November 2019), 100,000 people had participated in the VeggieChallenge over the course of 8 years; after the launch by all branches of ProVeg International, its website claimed over 250,000 people had internationally taken part in it as of June 2020. The spike in participants was mostly attributed to a sudden interest in avoiding meat after 1.2 million people watched popular satirical news television programme Zondag met Lubach on 24 November 2019, which featured an expos√© about mistreatment of animals in slaughterhouses that shocked many spectators. Vrindts stated that the challenge normally attracted about 2,000 people a month, which increased by 342% in the first three days after the show.  Public campaigns  De Vegarevolutie for sale at a stand at the Veggie Food Fair 2017. In 2014, the foundation published a handbook for beginning vegans, titled De Vegarevolutie. De onmisbare gids voor veganistisch eten ('The Veggie Revolution. The Unmissable Guide to Vegan Food'). The book was written by Lisa Steltenpool, a dietitian and then-president of the foundation, together with Veerle Vrindts and Pablo Moleman. After the European agricultural commission adopted a proposal to prohibit meat and dairy names for plant-based alternatives (such as 'vegetarian sausage' and 'soy schnitzel', as these were allegedly 'confusing') in April 2019, ProVeg launched a petition to prevent this intended 'veggie burger ban'. According to Moleman, consumers want to know what they buy, and references to products they are already familiar with give customers 'relevant information about taste, texture and application that they can expect from a plant-based product'. Within three days, the petition received over 16,000 signatures. In December 2019, Medical Care Minister Bruno Bruins, as part of the 'Food Labelling Action Plan', decided that these 'meat names' would remain permissible as long as it is clear to consumers that it is a vegetarian product; this meant that the meat industry was not given a monopoly on words such as 'burger, schnitzel and smoked sausage'.  Influencing the market  The foundation stimulates the development of a vegan market through an investment fund for startups, in November 2018 replaced by the international ProVeg Incubator. Furthermore, it cooperates with companies and advises food retailers on how to expand their plant-based options. Together with the Platform Eiwitinnovatie ('Protein Innovation Platform'), the foundation contributes to enlarging the number of vegan options and the replacement of animal ingredients. For example, ProVeg cooperates with meat analogue manufacturers to replace the use of chicken egg protein, and helped manufacturer GoodBite launch several new vegan meat substitutes. A large number of snackbars, including the Smullers chain, introduced vegan mayonnaise in response to the \\"Met Zonder Ei\\" campaign. Moreover, the foundation also introduced vegan cheesecake at several CoffeeCompany branches.

Apollo Masters was the only U.S. based manufacturing plant for producing lacquer discs used in pressing vinyl records. The destruction of the plant caused a ripple effect throughout the vinyl record industry, as it left only one operating lacquer plant in the world.  The fire  The fire began just before 8am, setting off three fire alarms and five or six explosions from within the building. The cause of the fire is presently undetermined. The inferno required eighty-two firefighters to extinguish it, spanning a total of three hours. While the building suffered complete destruction, none of the employees were injured.  Effect on record industry  Before the fire, Apollo Masters was one of two factories worldwide to manufacture lacquer discs to be shipped to vinyl pressing plants. There, the lacquer would be melted into a puck and pressed into a vinyl record. With the destruction of Apollo Masters, producing lacquer discs fell solely to a small Japanese company, MDC. This caused a significant strain on the industry, as Apollo Masters was responsible for 70-85% of lacquer production. Rebuilding of the facility is uncertain, as it would require hazardous waste remediation and navigating California's environmental laws. With a decrease in lacquer production, some vinyl pressing plants turned to alternate means of producing records, including direct metal mastering, a costly method of producing records with copper instead of lacquer. The fire also brought together the vinyl industry community, resulting in the creation of Vinyl Record Manufacturers Association of North America (VRMA), devoted to strengthening the industry.

Ant√≥nio Vieira (1608‚Äì1697) was a noted Jesuit preacher and missionary in Colonial Brazil. It was unveiled in 2017. History Originally planned since 2009, the monument commemorating Ant√≥nio Vieira was the result of a protocol between the Lisbon City Council and the Lisbon Holy House of Mercy. The final design, by sculptor Marco Telmo Areias Fidalgo, was selected in 2015 by a jury comprising representatives of the City Council, Holy House of Mercy, Society of Jesus, the Directorate- General for Cultural Heritage, and the National Academy of Fine Arts. It was unveiled on 22 June 2017, in the presence of Mayor Fernando Medina, Cardinal- Patriarch Manuel Clemente (who blessed the statue), Holy House of Mercy Chairman Pedro Santana Lopes, Jesuit priest Jos√© Fraz√£o Correia, and priest Ant√≥nio Vaz Pinto. Controversy and vandalism Shortly after it was unveiled, in October 2017, the statue was the subject of an organised protest action by anti-racist advocacy group Descolonizando (\\"Decolonising\\"), who judged Vieira was \\"selectively pro-slavery\\", associated him and the Catholic Church with the Atlantic slave trade to Brazil, and called Jesuit evangelisation \\"the greatest responsible for Amerindian ethnocide\\". The planned protest ‚Äî an homage to the indigenous peoples of the Americas with flowers, candles, signs and a poetry reading ‚Äî did not take place as the square was occupied by a counter-demonstration by far-right group Associa√ß√£o de Iniciativa C√≠vica Portugueses Primeiro (\\"The Portuguese First Civic Association\\"), with alleged ties to the Hammerskins. Following the killing of George Floyd on 25 May 2020 during a police arrest in the United States, protests broke out internationally, showing opposition to racism worldwide, with a number of statues and memorials being the subject of protests. In Lisbon, a peaceful demonstration and march of about 10,000 people took place on 6 June without incident. Five days after, on 11 June, the statue of Ant√≥nio Vieira was found to have been defaced: the priest's mouth, hands, and habit were covered in red paint, the figures of the indigenous children were branded with hearts, and the word \\"Decolonise\\" was graffitied across the plinth. The action was publicly condemned by President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, who called it a \\"truly imbecile\\" gesture, saying \\"it is difficult not to know that Father Ant√≥nio Vieira was one of the greatest characters in the country's history... he fought for independence, was a great diplomat, was a very progressive man for his time\\", and showed concern for gratuitous extremism that \\"does nothing, in practice, to change the living conditions of those who are discriminated\\". The City Council had the monument cleaned later that same day.

Camp Ronald McDonald for Good Times is a California-based camp for children with cancer. Established in 1983 as an expansion of a 1977 effort to build temporary housing for seriously ill children and their families during treatment, the charity drew financial and organizational support from numerous celebrities, with Dustin Hoffman and Michael Jackson playing prominent roles in its early growth. History The predecessor of the camp was a project announced in November 1977 to build a temporary home for up to 16 seriously ill children and their families to stay during treatment, sponsored by the Los Angeles Rams football team, the McDonald's Operators of Southern California, and Children's Hospital Los Angeles. The house was to be owned and operated by a nonprofit group formed for this purpose, Southern California Children's Cancer Services.John Hollon, \\"Home for Critically Ill Children Planned\\", Los Angeles Times (November 30, 1977), p.

Later in 1984, Camp Good Times was renamed Camp Ronald McDonald for Good Times.\\"Camp Ronald McDonald to Be Held at Malibu Ranch\\", Los Angeles Times (August 10, 1984), p. V-7. Dustin Hoffman had become interested in the charity due to the experience of his nephew, who visited the camp while fighting leukemia. Hoffman and Michael Jackson, another of the most significant contributors to the effort, were considered the \\"Founding Fathers\\" of the camp. Following the 1984 Victory Tour, headlined by The Jackson 5 and showcasing Jackson's solo material, Jackson donated his entire share of the proceeds, an estimated , to charity. Camp Ronald McDonald for Good Times was one of three major recipients of these donations, enabling the charity to build a year-round facility.\\"Michael Jackson: Three charities to benefit from his 'Victory Tour'\\", Escondido Times-Advocate (September 27, 1984), p. A2. All profits from Jackson's February 1988 single, \\"Man in the Mirror\\", the fourth consecutive number one single from Jackson's album, Bad, also went to this charity. In 1985, Michael Landon filmed a two episodes of the NBC series Highway to Heaven at the camp, allowing some children at the camp to appear in the episodes. The episodes, \\"A Song for Jason: Episode 1\\" and \\"A Song for Jason: Episode 2\\", opened season 2 of the show, and aired on September 18 and 25, 1985. Between the two episodes, Brian Lane Green, Robin Riker, Giovanni Ribisi, Joshua John Miller, and Barry Williams guest starred either as children at the camp or their parents. President Ronald Reagan visited the camp in 1987 to speak to children there, and made a personal donation to support it.Vaughn Proctor, \\"Reagan pays call on camp, The Lompoc Record (April 19, 1987), p. 1, 12. He visited the camp again as a former president in 1989, welcoming four girls from the Soviet Union who were recovering from cancer.\\"For the Kids\\", The White Plains Journal News (August 31, 1989), p. 3. In 1993, executive director Pepper Edmiston, who had participating in founding the camp, was removed from her position on the board of directors, claiming that her ousting resulted from her taking children to the inauguration of President Bill Clinton, which Edmiston asserted was opposed by McDonald's due to disagreement with Clinton's health care policies. Donors who supported Edmiston then sued the camp, alleging misuse of funds. The following year, Edminston started the competing Happy Trails Camp, also in California, to enable disabled children to work with and ride horses.Beverly Beyette, \\"Happy Trails Are Here Again\\", Los Angeles Times (December 9, 1994), p.

One of the youngsters brought with him a large serving of pie, which another boy named Tommy steals and runs away from the group.

After taking the eggs, Tommy climbs down and then argues in his dream with his friend. The boys disagree about how to share the eggs, so they leave one another. Later in his dream, as he walks alone across a cornfield, Tommy is confronted by a huge sparrow that is even larger in size than the boy. The bird accuses him for egg theft and calls a equally large police bird, who arrests Tommy and \\"jails\\" him in a large bird cage. A trial before Judge Eagle is then convened to try the boy for his crime. Other human- sized birds assemble in the forest to act as jurors and witnesses in the outdoor court. After the jury quickly finds Tommy guilty, the judge sentences him to be beheaded. A flock of birds now forms a \\"death march\\" to escort the condemned boy to the chopping block, where the Crow, Birdland's executioner, is holding a large axe. There, Tommy is forced to place his head on the block, but just before the Crow strikes the fatal blow, Tommy awakens. He finds himself back in the reality of Boyland. His friend is awake too, and says he is hungry again after eating the pie. He suggests that they should find a bird's nest and take some eggs. Tommy refuses. Having gained a new perspective from his nightmare, he vows never again to steal from a nest.\\"The Old-Time Nightmare (Sept. 19)\\", The Moving Picture World, September 16, 1911 p. 824.

Combining films onto one reel not only reduced the number of reels shipped to theaters by distributors, it also reduced the number of reel changes on the projectors at those locations. In September 1911, when Powers Moving Picture Company distributed its split-reel copies of Lost in a Hotel and An Old-Time Nightmare, this comedy-fantasy comprised the latter half of all the shared reels released. The Billboard, September 16, 1911 The film in 1911 was generally well-received by reviewers, who judged it to be an amusing oddity as well as a \\"worthwhile\\" screen presentation.\\"'The Old-Time Nightmare' (Powers)\\", The Moving Picture World, October 7, 1911 p. 41.

The film is therefore presumed to be a lost production. Powers Moving Picture Company continued producing films as a single, independent studio for only seven months after the release of An Old-Time Nightmare. In May 1912 Powers formally merged with other production companies to form Universal Film Manufacturing Company.Horsley, David (1914). \\"David Horsley Tells History of Hollywood\\", The Arizona Republican (Phoenix), February 16, 1925, p. 12.

Properties of those companies were later consolidated under the ownership of Carl Laemmle and selectively transferred in 1915 to Universal's new, burgeoning studio complex in Universal City, California. If any master negatives and prints of this film and others by Powers were later physically transferred to Universal, that footage may have been lost in devastating fires that often occurred throughout the motion-picture industry in the silent era, including at Universal. At any given time, many millions of feet of old and new films that had been shot on unstable, highly flammable cellulose nitrate stock were stored in film vaults and in various studio warehouses. It is more likely, however, that subsequent studio managers deemed this short and its split-reel companion Lost in a Hotel to be inconsequential releases by a short-lived, secondary production company and were discarded or perhaps were simply left unattended and allowed to decay and disintegrate over time.

The parade culminated in a theatrical performance of the famous song Den Pobedy. The 2020 parade was the only parade in the former Soviet Union besides Turkmenistan's to be held. Impact of coronavirus outbreak on parade preparations Due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Belarus, there were questions over the wisdom of holding a military parade. By the time the virus arrived in Belarus in later February, the Ministry of Defense had reportedly already had more than 2,000 servicemen arriving in Minsk to begin training. As per usual, the rehearsals with the mechanized columns took place at Lipki Aerodrome. A petition was created and submitted for consideration to the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Defense calling for the cancellation of rehearsals as well as the parade. It also called for the banning of foreign military representatives in order to avoid the transmission of the virus. On 27 March, President Lukashenko reaffirmed his commitment to holding the parade, even saying that his government was \\"mulling over the possibilities for me to attend the parade there [in Moscow] as well\\". Because of Lukashenko's plans, it was settled that the parade would be held in the early evening, following the format of jubilee Independence Day parades, in order to allow Lukashenko to attend the morning parade in Moscow first. This was later changed as soon as it was announced the Moscow parade was cancelled. On 11 April, Deputy Minister of Defense of Belarus, Sergei Potapenko, confirmed that preparations for the parade will continue and that no cancellation will be considered, saying that \\"a complex of antiepidemiologic and therapeutic measures is taking place\\" and that there are \\"no problems with preparing to the parade\\". Members of the Honor Guard of the Armed Forces of Belarus were infected with the virus by late April. Governmental planning When speaking on the decision to hold the parade to cabinet members, Lukashenko described it as \\"an emotional, deeply ideological thing\\". At that same meeting, he gave instructions that no one \\"should be dragged to this mass event\\". There were reports that suggested university students were offered incentives to attend the parade. These incentives, which manifested in a recruiting campaign among university students, included academic and dormitory bonuse for members of the Belarusian Academy of Sciences and recovered COVID-19 patients. =International presence at the parade= Parade formations from Russia and China were planned to be participants, until the spokespersons of both military departments cancelled their participation. On 5 May, Lukashenko has invited international leaders to attend the parade. He said: \\"I invite all heads of state, at least those from the former Soviet Union, to come to Minsk and attend this parade.\\"https://tass.com/world/1153101 The day after this statement was made, the office of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky announced that he would not travel to Minsk for the parade. In a video conference with Prescient Lukashenko, Moldovan President Igor Dodon expressed how \\"impressed\\" he was by the fact that the parade was still able to go on. Lukashenko also was open to the presence of Russian deputies and senators who expressed a desire to attend the parade in Minsk, saying that \\"We welcome this\\" and that \\"We don‚Äôt close the doors from our friends and brothers\\". The ambassadors of the following 18 countries attended: Azerbaijan, Armenia, Hungary, Venezuela, Vietnam, Iran, North Korea, Kazakhstan, China, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Palestine, Russia, Slovakia, Turkey, Tajikistan, the UAE and Serbia. In addition, the charg√©s d'affaires of Sudan, Libya and Pakistan, and the Permanent Representative of Russia to the CIS, Andrei Grozov were in attendance. One of the attendees was Slovak Ambassador and former Speaker of National Council of the Slovak Republic Jozef Miga≈°, who resigned later on as a result of his attendance. He would later be awarded the Order of Francysk Skaryna by Lukashenko. EffectsPublic reactions= Disagreements with the government's stance came in the form of public criticisms and expressions of concern. Belarusian opposition leader Gennady Fedynich compared the parade to holding \\"a feast during the plague\\". Other criticisms came from prominent opposition leaders such as Stanislav Shushkevich, Mikhail Chigir. On May 9, 2020, dozens of supporters of Belarusian blogger and activist Syarhei Tsikhanouski held an \\"Anti-parade\\" in Babruisk to express their disagreement with the Victory Day Parade in Minsk during the COVID-19 pandemic. The protest parade took the form of a protest motor rally. Police detained about 15 people after the motor rally.Dozens of drivers held a parade in Bobruisk // Belsat TV About 15 people were detained in Babruisk after the AntiParad action // Radio Liberty Syarhei Tsikhanouski was in detention in that moment. =On the pandemic= The World Health Organization attributed the rising rate of infections in the country to the \\"lack of adequate social distancing measures\\" and urged the government cancel the parade. The day of the parade saw and increase of case by 1271 people, with the trend staying the same over the next couple of days. On 13 May, NEXTA reported a total of 27,717 cases with a daily gain of 1,369. =On relations with Russia= In the Western media, the parade gave the appearance of an attempt to upstage the Moscow celebrations. The contrasting messages from both countries clashed when the Belarusian government accused Channel One Russia correspondent Alexei Kruchinin and his cameraman of spreading fake news about the virus in Belarus. On 6 May, Kremlin Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov refuted allegations that Russian President Vladimir Putin criticized Lukashenko for holding the parade, calling them \\"unreliable wild speculations\\". Investigative journalist Ihar Tyshkevich suggested that one of the motives for holding the parade was to fight Russian propaganda about the country that had increased in the previous year.

Nasution went to elementary school in Pontianak, West Kalimantan and middle and high schools in Bandar Lampung. He studied agribusiness for university, obtaining his bachelors and masters from the Bogor Agricultural Institute. Career In 2011, Nasution began working in the real estate industry, initially repairing homes and reselling them, then building some homes and being involved in larger projects. By 2016, he joined the real estate Takke Group as a marketing director through the introduction of his father. Outside of real estate, Nasution had briefly worked as a manager for the football club Medan Jaya in 2014. While studying for his master's degree in Bogor, Nasution met Kahiyang Ayu, daughter of incumbent president Joko Widodo (Jokowi). They dated for around a year after they met in 2015, and the two married in November 2017, through a ceremony in Jokowi's hometown of Surakarta which was attended by some 7,000 live guests and watched by millions of people. Nasution submitted a bid to run as a mayoral candidate for his hometown of Medan in the 2020 Indonesian local elections through Jokowi's political party PDI-P. This caused multiple observers to suggest that a political dynasty was being established, which Nasution denied. In ensuing months, he visited Gerindra chairman Prabowo Subianto and National Mandate Party chairman Zulkifli Hasan to gather support for his candidacy, in addition to registering with Golkar. He had officially become a cadre of PDI-P in March 2020.

He gained notoriety in November/December 2001 as the supposed source of allegations about bribing of top Polish politicians by Skowro≈Ñski, and as the source of allegations of visits by Afghan militants to the Polish village of Klewki related to alleged anthrax experimentation conducted there.Wiernikowska pp. 23-35. * Translation of an excerpt: G: At Inter Commerce, I was a director. I was associated with the company since 1992, even during my work for the state-owned bus transport company in G≈Çog√≥w, in Leszno and in Jelenia G√≥ra. [...] W: And what was going on in Klewki? [...] G: About 250 [cattle] were buried, because during my tenure, experiments of an unknown nature, ordered by Mr. Skowro≈Ñski, were conducted on that cattle. W: What kind of experiments? G: Vaccines of various kinds were tested, including [experiments] on causing E. coli, gangrenous mastitis-related bacteria, and anthrax too. I remember how it started: in the summer of 2000 Mr. Skowro≈Ñski arrived in Klewki in his helicopter. Before that, he gave instructions to send everyone home, leave only the cowshed employees and dress them nicely in white lab coats. Two Afghan citizens arrived with him. During the inspection these gentlemen walked through all the rooms of the facility and then went to the manor. I asked what was the purpose of this visit. He said that, possibly, we were going to be testing some vaccines, that a lab would be built, that he wanted to sign a contract. I thought, why not. But later, when these vaccines were delivered, came the order to refuse inspections by the Circuit [Sanitary and Epidemiological] Station. The veterinarian stopped coming to the facility altogether. [...] The Environmental Control Inspector [...] says he saw the documentation, which he could not have seen, because I have it and referred it to the DA's office. W: What documentation? G: Veterinary documentation. Because I was keeping the documentation personally, I was applying the vaccines and I know what were the symptoms related to these animals' deaths, with a detailed description of these experiments. W: You wrote, black on white, that there is anthrax there? G: Yes. The instructions were to take milk from these animals into special test tubes and pack it. Mr. Skowro≈Ñski would send his people in, and it was taken to a lab in Warsaw. * Translation of an excerpt: G: I provided a list of seven people who took part in burying [the animals] and who witnessed how these animals were dying en masse and how they were being dealt with. There is a law that clearly says that all [dead] animals should be shipped to Bacutil facilities and rendered. During my tenure, not a single one of them went to Bacutil. W: Why? G: Because it was forbidden. The animals were being buried in three different places. The most terrifying part is that these animals are buried in the Watercourse and Lake Protection Zone [strefa hydrogeniczna] of Jezioro Klebarskie and Jezioro Silickie lakes, close to Olsztyn. In the village of Lelek the animals are buried in the Watercourse and Lake Protection Zone of Lake Ta≈Çty and Lake ≈öniardwy. [...] In 2000, mass water contamination occurred in Klebark. The press did write about it. Over 200 people got food poisoning, a few ended up in a hospital in a relatively serious condition. The prosecutor's office investigated that, but they found out nothing, only that the contamination comes from Inter Commerce, because the water pumping station for gmina Purda was next to our farm, where cows from the German company Western Union [actually, Rinder-Union West] arrived two months earlier. W: Did you personally take part in the burying? G: No, I was a director of course, and did not work at burying cattle. There were three of us, directors of Inter Commerce for the Masuria region, but two fled out of fear, because they did not want anything to do with that business. No director worked at Inter Commerce for more than two, three months anyway. People kept being replaced. So that no one was too much in the know about what was happening at the company. I was able to stay the longest only because I agreed to collaborate. W: About that, what other responsibilities did you have? G: As Mr. Skowro≈Ñski's trusted person, I used to be taken to talks about construction of shopping malls, especially the Carrefour in Szczecin. I also worked at equipping the Tesco shopping mall in Jelenia G√≥ra. I used to be sent to various cities in Europe. My task was to carry various packages, plans/maps, and some parcels. [...] After 9/11 I immediately started connecting the facts. No one can accuse me of not doing anything. Within a few days I notified the Circuit Prosecutor's Office in Jelenia G√≥ra, the Central Bureau of Investingation [CB≈ö], UrzƒÖd Ochrony Pa≈Ñstwa in Wroc≈Çaw and told them I had been carrying these things. W: What specifically? G: Maps of airports, floor plans of buildings, floor plans of hotels. Other packages were in small boxes, 20 cm by 10 cm, which could not be opened, because had I opened it, everyone would have known it had been opened, right? But some folders were not sealed. You could browse them normally. W: Did you also use to carry money? G: Twice: once to Krak√≥w and once to Paris, to de Gaulle Airport. W: Did you know to whom and what for? G: Yes, or rather I only made the connection between the facts later. W: When did you stop being a trusted man? G: Maybe it happened in February this year [2001], when I said during a conversation with N[rest of the name censored] and Skowro≈Ñski that I don't want to take part in that kind of business. Working in Masuria, I used to meet with Mr. Andrzej Zieli≈Ñski ‚Äî \\"S≈Çowik\\". Other people who were Skowro≈Ñski's guests were such gangsters as Ryszard Niemczyk, and earlier \\"Pershing\\"... W: Did you see them? G: Of course I saw them and talked to them. I was no secret. [...] W: But you knew a lot. G: That's why in February [2001] I said I would like to withdraw from the company's activities, but it would be best if I were reassigned to some other facility. The company has its field offices [delegatury] in all of Poland, in all of Europe... W: But back then, you still did not go to a prosecutor's office yet? G: No, not yet back then, besides, there was no point going to a prosecutor's office in Olsztyn because [censored]. Mr. Skowro≈Ñski was perfectly informed about all actions to be undertaken by the Central Bureau of Investigation [CB≈ö] and by UOP. The police were also at Mr. Skowro≈Ñski's service. * Translation of an excerpt: G: I learned yesterday from one newspaper that I have been a Mossad agent for six years. Nothing can surprise me anymore. * Translation of an excerpt: G: More and more people remind themselves about the company Inter Commerce: customs officers at Okƒôcie Airport, who were receiving emeralds from Afghanistan; quote-unquote emeralds, because Mr. Skowro≈Ñski used to smuggle drugs to Poland in the containers. W: What drugs? Smuggled them where? Data, specifics, please. Where are you getting this [information] from? G: Madam, I was a director at Inter Commerce and I was in the know about some things. I don't know if he still does it, because he could have halted it after the whole thing was disclosed, couldn't he? W: From Afghanistan to where? G: To Europe, through Poland. In Poland they were received by residents [or \\"station chiefs\\"; term from espionage/organized crime parlance] of Pruszk√≥w Mafia and Wo≈Çomin Mafia, distibuted within the country, and [carried] further, via border crossings in Bezledy, Jakuszyce, Ko≈Çbaskowo. They were carried further on, via their own channels. W: How was he paying? G: Mostly with weapons. W: From where? G: Russia, former USSR countries. Mr. Skowro≈Ñski has many field offices [delegatury] of Inter Commerce there. He wasn't paying with weapons only, he was also paying with money deposited by many Afghanistan-related organizations. Mr. Skowro≈Ñski was the owner of the German company Grama Handels GmbH, which has been, since as early as 1989 or 1990, doing business with Afghanistan: with Kabul, with Kandahar, with Jalalabad and other cities. One of Afghan ministers is Mr. Skowro≈Ñski's friend. We know that person's name, we have the photos from his visit to Poland and his meeting with Mr. Skowro≈Ñski. W: Mr. Skowro≈Ñski claims that he maintained contact with General Massoud. If so, then not with his opponents, the Taliban. G: Indeed, I had the opportunity to personally meet General Massoud while working for Inter Commerce. It was in the Czech Republic in, I think, 1999. General Massoud was, because he's deceased, the head of the Northern Alliance, which controlled 80% of opium farming in Afghanistan and it was that pact's main source of income and support. We have evidence that Mr. Skowro≈Ñski maintained contacts not only with General Massoud, but also with other people, via ‚Äî among others ‚Äî the aforementioned company. * Translation of an excerpt: W: How did you know bin Laden's phone number? G: Trybuna [a newspaper] publishes fabricated bullshit, there was no phone number there. W: This diary of yours, does it exist or not? G: There was a notebook, I mean my notes, copied from Skowro≈Ñski's correspondence that I carried to Bochum. I copied it into my day planner, where there was blank space, on pages with next year's dates. I gave these notes to the officers of the Central Bureau of Investigation [CB≈ö] in Szczecin right after my return. There is no diary of mine, it's fabricated. I am not going to comment on the actions of Trybuna. * Translation of an excerpt: G: What tipped the scale were the events of April 17. After I left the company [building?], the secretary called me and warned me not to come to the office, because three men, Ukrainians or Russians, arrived, and barged into my office armed with guns. I did not go to the facility, I only contacted my boss. N[rest of the name censored] made it clear that it was meant to be an attempt to frighten me, so that I know my place. I thought about it shortly and made my choice: on April 20 I went abroad. I came to Greece, sat down for a few hours and started organizing things in my head. I had money, savings, I could have stayed abroad, set myself up in the US or somewhere. But I thought: no, I won't be disposed of like that. Terrorized or killed. And I returned the next day. After I returned to Poland, I began my trek... [...] I did not go to the police or UOP's offices because I knew who is behind it. [...] I couldn't have gone to an office where a guy would call Skowro≈Ñski and tell him: listen, there is a Gasi≈Ñski here going around and talking on you. He needs to be taken care of. It was some time until I took a look around, checked the company's previous connections. * Translation of an excerpt: [Gasi≈Ñski] did not pay for dinner in a restaurant in Pozna≈Ñ, which resulted in an intervention by UOP officers [...] But, for example, why was it secret service officers that took him out of the Pozna≈Ñ restaurant? Our hero‚Äîan avid spook and an investigator of misconduct‚Äîhad various run-ins with bosses and with the law, but somehow used to get out of all of them scot-free. Why? Investigative journalists did not venture that far. Wiernikowska pp. 51-56. Quotes this 2001 letter: Other allegations by Gasi≈Ñski are related to 9/11 perpetrators. While Aleksander Makowski (a former top spy, an Inter Commerce employee (1990-1995 and 1998-2000),Wiernikowska p. 72 and pp. 76-77. Translation of an excerpt: An anecdote: someone from Polsat phones Rudolf Skowro≈Ñski and asks him if it is a rule that he employs high-rank officers of Wojskowe S≈Çu≈ºby Informacyjne [military intelligence]. \\"Not more of them than the members of the Central Committee [of the Polish United Workers' Party] that you yourself employ\\", replies the head of Inter Commerce. It is striking that this anecdote is told on the pages of \\"Rzeczpospolita\\" by Skowro≈Ñski himself. Is it according to the principle: \\"Say the truth out loud and no one will believe\\"? Because afterwards, I will hear many times that they are \\"people from the services\\" [special services], that Skowro≈Ñski is \\"covered by Dw√≥jka\\" [ZarzƒÖd II SG WP, communist-era military intelligence], that in Inter Commerce \\"the person running the game is Makowski\\", a high-rank intelligence officer. But who is going to say this on camera? Who is going to sign this? And who is going to publish this? [...] And here are short biographical notes: Aleksander Makowski, age 52, Doctor of Law.

The secret of the Taliban in Klewki. Machine translation, original. Wirtualna Polska. January 9, 2014. Translation: Makowski also says where the \\"Taliban\\" in Klewki came from. After being negatively verified in 1990, Majewski and Reszka's interviewee went into business. He had business ventures in Afghanistan and sometimes it happened that Afghans were hosted by his associate Rudolf Skowro≈Ñski, indeed in Masuria. \\"Lots of people flew in from there. We hosted, for example, Arif Sarwari - the future Minister of the Interior and one of Massoud's main aides. Out of the company's pocket we flew in at least two wounded soldiers from Massoud's units. The Afghans visited Rudolf's ranch in Klewki, but also his manor near MrƒÖgowo. A large stream of these Afghans flowed through Poland. It was a very good destination for them because one of the biggest aggregations of Afghans, often influential ones, was in Germany\\" - explains the former intelligence officer. How did it happen that a scandal broke out? \\"It all started with Bogdan Gasi≈Ñski, who was the manager of the farm in Klewki. He was sitting there with his collagues, they were drinking a sea's worth of vodka and ideas of every kind were coming to their heads. Then Lepper picked that up and Maria Wiernikowska's book \\"Zwariowa≈Çam\\" (\\"I went mad\\") came into being. The title reflects the character of the publication appropriately\\" - says Makowski.) confirmed one part of Gasi≈Ñski's widely-ridiculed claims in his 2014 book‚Äîhe said that Afghan militants indeed visited Klewki, and that they were only Ahmad Shah Massoud's mujahideen‚Äîhe dismissed other claims made by Gasi≈Ñski, and a 2005 book published on the subject, as crazy. Makowski himself described, in the aforementioned 2014 book, how Makowski and Skowro≈Ñski traveled multiple times to the Panjshir Valley to meet with Massoud, how they traded in emeralds with the mujahideen, how they printed money in Poland which was to be used as an official currency by Massoud's Northern Alliance, how an attempt to supply weapons to the Afghans supposedly failed because Americans objected to it; and how Makowski's knowledge of Afghanistan became useful when he was later hired to provide intelligence to Polish soldiers in the war in Afghanistan. Gasi≈Ñski however paints a different picture, alleging that they were providing weapons to the Afghans in exchange for drugs, mentioning the Northern Alliance's opium farming in this context. Gasi≈Ñski was sentenced to 38 years' imprisonment, all for non-violent crimesA defiant prisoner. Years ago he was Lepper's advisor. Machine translation, original. Polska The Times. August 7, 2016 and animal cruelty. Chronology Gasi≈Ñski was one of three directors of Inter Commerce for the Masuria region. He claimed two other directors fled because they did not want anything to do with Inter Commerce's real field of activity. He says that personnel in Inter Commerce was regularly replaced, and that he himself was kept as an employee for years only because he agreed to \\"collaborate\\" (suggesting involvement with an intelligence agency, organized crime, or both). By his own account, in February 2001 Gasi≈Ñski tried to withdraw from the company's activities, asking for a reassignment to some other location. Gasi≈Ñski says he abandoned his post in Klewki after being threatened in April 2001. He also called public attention to himself by buying a car at a charity auction from the organizers of the country's most popular charity concert.Wiernikowska p. 164 It is not clear what Gasi≈Ñski was doing in the following months, in the middle of 2001. There are reports he was jailed for some reason in Jelenia G√≥ra. Later, on October 28, 2001, Gasinski apparently sent a letter to the DA's office. The letter makes the following claims: * That Rudolf Skowro≈Ñski, head of Inter Commerce, was a close friend of Andrzej \\"S≈Çowik\\" Zieli≈Ñski and was meeting regularly with some other gangsters of the Pruszk√≥w Gang; that the Pruszk√≥w Gang and Inter Commerce were so closely linked they were practically the same organization;Wiernikowska p. 143 and that the gang distributed Skowro≈Ñski's drugs in Poland and abroad * that Skowro≈Ñski's emerald trade with Afghanistan was just a cover for importing drugs, and that Skowro≈Ñski paid the Afghans back with guns, and also supplied bioweapons to the Afghans * that local and regional officials, including police officials, in the Masuria region were routinely bribed by Skowro≈Ñski * that Skowro≈Ñski also paid for the campaigns of top (not local) politicians; the letter mentions at least one of them by name * that Gasi≈Ñski himself helped Ryszard Niemczyk escape from the country by transporting him from Krak√≥w to Nowy SƒÖcz on October 31, 2000, and that Ryszard Niemczyk was the killer of Marek Papa≈Ça (head of the Polish police) * that in September 2000 Gasi≈Ñski himself supplied plans of some objects to Afghan nationals at Nice Airport; and that on the same day at Frankfurt Airport he received a package from a citizen of a Middle Eastern country destined for Skowro≈Ñski, that package containing plans of Frankfurt Airport * that Gasi≈Ñski himself gave and received, multiple times, packages containing plans (maps) of passenger jets (Embraer, Boeing 767), of Okƒôcie Airport, of hotels, of railway/bus stations etc (and other packages that he could not open without leaving evidence of tampering) and at two times, money shipments; that the meeting points where handovers took place were often in Bochum, Dusseldorf, Munich, Paris, and they happened also in Szczecin, Pozna≈Ñ, Krak√≥w; and most interestingly, that the parcels were addressed to Mohamed Ali (sic) Atta, Hassan Algadi Banihammad, Abdulaziz Alomari, Mahand [Mohand] Alshehri and Saeed Alghamdi * that Gasi≈Ñski himself met Hassan Algadi Banihammad in 1997 in Pozna≈Ñ * that one of the aforementioned (by name) recipients of parcels was a close acquaintance of Skowro≈Ñski (and Gasi≈Ñski saw that person more than one time at Chr√≥≈õcicki street in Warsaw) * that Ryszard Niemczyk was in possession of detailed plans of a terror attack on the USA * that some members of the Pruszk√≥w gang, including Jaros≈Çaw \\"Chi≈Ñczyk\\" Maringe, played an important role in \\"bomb attacks in the USA\\" One of the adits in uranium mines near Kowary. The mining work here ended in 1973 and the mines are used only for university research and as a tourist attraction. Gasi≈Ñski claims that in the 1990s, he and others were able to obtain 3 tonnes of material from these mines. Gasi≈Ñski claimed that earlier, in 1994-1999, he took part in overseeing mining work at a uranium mine in Kowary (formally closed). Gasi≈Ñski also mentioned anthrax experimentation (see below). In later conversations with Maria Wiernikowska (December 2001), Gasi≈Ñski recalled personally meeting Ahmad Shah Massoud in 1999 in the Czech Republic while working for Inter Commerce; he also said that Massoud's organization was supported mostly by opium trade. While Skowro≈Ñski implied that the only Afghans he had been in contact with were Massoud and people from Massoud's organization, Gasi≈Ñski also mentioned Skowro≈Ñski maintaining contacts with \\"other people\\" in this context. Only a month after sending the letter, at the end of November 2001, Gasi≈Ñski went to the politician Andrzej Lepper with information about top politicians: Andrzej Olechowski, Pawe≈Ç Piskorski and Jerzy Szmajdzi≈Ñski receiving money from Skowro≈Ñski (later, in early December 2001, Gasi≈Ñski repeated these allegations in a written report that he gave to Lepper and two other MPs: ≈Åy≈ºwi≈Ñski and ≈ªywiecWiernikowska pp. 43-47). Lepper, who was a vice-marshal of the House and the leader of the Samoobrona political party, which had just become a major political power, publicly made these allegations (plus allegations against two other politicians) during a session of the House. A major scandal broke out. Gasi≈Ñski was thrust into the spotlight. Lepper was sued by the politicians whom he accused, and in 2005 the court ruled in their favor, sentencing Lepper for slander.Lepper sentenced by the court for slandering PO and SLD politicians.

Earlier reports by Gasi≈Ñski Gasi≈Ñski made at least some of his claims even before sending the aforementioned October 28, 2001 letter to a prosecutor's office in Olsztyn. When Gasi≈Ñski was interrogated in jail in Jelenia G√≥ra \\"at the beginning of September\\" 2001, he made at least the claim about delivering money to the fugitive Ryszard Niemczyk in Krak√≥w.https://wyborcza.pl/1,76842,597734.html Gasi≈Ñski made a report of crime to a prosecutor's office in Olsztyn at least twice (not necessarily to the same office); and at least two times it was ignored.Wiernikowska p. 56 At least one letter, containing a report of crime, was sent by Gasi≈Ñski to a prosecutor's office from jail.

Head of a prosecutor's office in Olsztyn told the press that Gasi≈Ñski came forward with his report, containing the anthrax accusations, \\"in September I think\\".https://wyborcza.pl/1,76842,595786.html The importance of the timing of Gasi≈Ñski's anthrax claims‚Äîwhether it was in September or in October‚Äîis that although the anthrax letters were allegedly sent on September 18 (just a day after the Polish media published information about people affiliated with bin Laden's organization buying anthrax in the Czech Republichttps://wiadomosci.wp.pl/ludzie-bin-ladena-kupowali-w-czechach-bron- biologiczna-6109066368574593a), the American press did not report on the anthrax letters before Robert Stevens' admission to a hospital (and his death) in October. Anthrax Gasi≈Ñski wrote to the DA's office - and maintained that it is the truth in his conversation with Maria Wiernikowska - that experiments were being secretly performed on cattle at Skowro≈Ñski's ranch in Klewki. According to him, this included experimentation with E. coli and anthrax. He said cows were injected with what was supposed to be vaccines, coming from the Czech Republic and Israel, and mortality among the cattle was high. Gasi≈Ñski said he was ordered to take milk samples from the cows, and these samples were shipped to a laboratory in Warsaw. He said the experimentation started in the summer of 2000, after two Afghan citizens, who arrived in a helicopter with Skowro≈Ñski, were given a tour of the cowshed, and that Skowro≈Ñski specifically claimed their visit was related to plans to test vaccines and build a lab. Dead animals were reportedly not shipped to a utilization plant, but instead buried in three different places, close to lakes. Gasi≈Ñski linked water poisoning in Klebark in 2000 (over two hundred people affected, a few in serious condition) to this activity and said the DA's office had also linked this water poisoning to Inter Commerce. Wiernikowska takes interest The former manor in Klewki, which was part of Skowro≈Ñski's ranch before Skowro≈Ñski disappeared War correspondent Maria Wiernikowska was probably the only journalist who took Gasi≈Ñski seriously. Other journalists portrayed Gasi≈Ñski as a fraudster and/or as someone spreading fantasies influenced by media reports about 9/11. Wiernikowska noted links of Gasi≈Ñski's place of employment to the Polish military intelligence WSI. A situation when Gasi≈Ñski was escorted out of a restaurant by members of UOP instead of ordinary police also caught her attention. Gasi≈Ñski pointed out to her the strange deaths of Tadeusz Rusiecki (owner of casinos and handler of real estate belonging to the Russian embassy in Warsaw), of Rusiecki's Russian associate, and the poisoning of Rigobert Tauber (founder of the first casino in Warsaw). All three died within days of each other in February 2001. Gasi≈Ñski claimed Skowro≈Ñski planted his right-hand man Ralf Friedriksen in Rusiecki's company.Wiernikowska p. 9. However, Skowro≈Ñski was still portrayed in the media as a legitimate businessman; he did not deny links to Afghanistan, but portrayed himself as a friend of Ahmad Shah Massoud and denied any wrongdoing. Wiernikowska lost her job as a result of her continued interest in the subject. She later published a book entitled Zwariowa≈Çam (I went mad) in which she chronicled her investigation. A multitude of names in the book are censored (blacked out), even Skowro≈Ñski's name, but not the name of Aleksander Makowski, a former spy from the People's Republic of Poland era who later continued intelligence work for WSI. Aleksander Makowski was an employee at Inter Commerce. Wiernikowska mentioned the \\"rumor\\" that the person really ruling Inter Commerce was not Skowro≈Ñski, but Aleksander Makowski. However, to shield herself from legal troubles, she ended her book with the following caveat: \\"All I have written here is complete untruth\\".Wiernikowska p. 215. Translation of an excerpt: Someone told me I will go behind bars along with Lepper. Better to go to prison than to psykhushka, but, just in case, I am censoring the names.

Due to extensive family connections he eventually became a full partner in the Sandbach, Tinne & Company, a Scottish- ran company which dealt in trade in the same field and was prominent in British Guiana, to the extent that the men who were ran it were called the \\"Rothschilds of Demerara\\" on account of their wealth and influence.

Using monies from the payout to former slave-owners following the Slavery Abolition Act 1833, he purchased the islands of Raasay, Rona and Fladda from Clan MacLeod in 1846: he removed from the land twelve townships of ninety-four Gaelic Highlander families to make way for sheep farming, causing mass depopulation and displacement on the islands. Biography=Background George Rainy was born to Rev. George Rainy (1734‚Äî1810), a Presbyterian Church of Scotland minister in Creich, Sutherland, Scotland and his wife Ann Robertson. His grandfather had been John Rennie, a farmer in Turriff, Aberdeenshire, Scotland. Among George's siblings were Margaret Rainy (1774‚Äî1844), who married to Charles Parker (1771‚Äì1828), from a Scottish family in the Colony of Virginia and a major player in Sandbach, Tinne & Company, which ran sugarcane plantations in Demerara, Guiana. In addition to this, there was a brother Gilbert Rainy (1782‚Äî1808) who had gone to Berbice, Guiana to engage in the same trade. Retrieved on 20 March 2019. Harry Rainy, the noted pathologist and Professor of Forensic Medicine at the University of Glasgow was another brother, making George Rainy the uncle of Robert Rainy a Scottish Presbyterian divine for whom Rainy Hall in New College, Edinburgh is named. Plantations in Guiana George Rainy followed his brother, Gilbert Rainy, into the sugar trade in Guiana. He became associated with the Scottish- dominated, Liverpool-based company Sandbach, Tinne & Company. This company had been founded in 1790 when his uncle George Robertson, who had been trading in Grenada and his future brother-in-law Charles Parker joined with Samuel Sandbach and the Demerara merchant James McInroy (1759‚Äì1825) to create what was originally known as McInroy, Sandbach & Company. This business had been described as the \\"Rothschilds of Demerara\\" in the 1820s. It would become one of the most successful trading companies in the Caribbean, dealing with sugar plantations in the Caribbean which were worked by African slaves. These families created strong connections to each other through marriage. By the time that George Rainy joined the company as a partner in Liverpool it had become Sandbach, Tinne & Company. Retrieved on 20 March 2019. According to the journal of J.C. Cheveley, who visited in 1821, the estates in Demerara containing the slave-worked sugar plantations, were heavily mortgaged to Sandbach, Tinne & Company. He stated that many estates which were mortgaged out had to rely on the company for shipping out sugar on ships own by them, through their agents in Guiana and Britain. According to the Legacies of British Slave-Ownership at the University College London, Rainy was awarded a payment as a slave trader in the aftermath of the Slavery Abolition Act 1833 with the Slave Compensation Act 1837. The British Government took out a ¬£15 million loan (worth ¬£ in ) with interest from Nathan Mayer Rothschild and Moses Montefiore which was subsequently paid off by the British taxpayers (ending in 2015). Rainy had a large number of primary and secondary claims, thirty in total. Rainy owned 2793 slaves in Guiana and received a ¬£146,295 payment at the time (worth ¬£ in ). Retrieved on 20 March 2019. Some Scottish newspapers such as The Sunday Post have claimed that Rainy received the largest payout of all the slave owners. Retrieved on 20 March 2019. The largest plantations which Rainy owned in Guiana were Leonora, Zeelandia, La Jalousie & Fellowship, among others. Retrieved on 20 March 2019. Highland Clearances As the Atlantic slave trade and the triangular trade associated with it was brought to an end, Rainy returned to Britain. In 1846, George Rainy bought the islands of Raasay, Rona and Fladda, a group of islands in the G√†idhealtachd, between the Isle of Skye and the mainland of Scotland. The island had been ruled by Clan Macleod of Raasay for several centuries but had declined in the aftermath of their clan rallying to the standard of Charles Edward Stuart in the Jacobite rising of 1745. The last laird, John Macleod, was deep in debt and chose to emigrate to Tasmania having sold Raasay for 35,000 guineas to Rainy. During this period, with the decline of traditional culture in the Scottish Highlands, many land speculators and landlords moved in to \\"improve\\" the estate; the main purpose of this was to clear the native Highland Gaels from the lands, either to urban centres in Great Britain or abroad to North America and Australasia, to make way for sheep farming. This was known as the Highland Clearances. When Rainy came to control Raasay, he set about implementing this process on the island and has been described as \\"a cruel landlord who epitomised the horror of the Clearances.\\" There had been a steady drip of emigration from the island in the previous two decades, but when Rainy came to control the islands, this went into overdrive. Donald MacLeod (born 1805), a crofter from Torran, Raasay provided testimony to the Napier Commission on 22 May 1883 in regards to abuses under Rainy's tenure at Raasay. He stated that when Rainy came to control the island he enacted a rule that nobody should marry on the island, so that the local natives could not reproduce their population. This has been described as \\"a measure of control reminiscent of the slave plantations\\". MacLeod described an incident where a man by the name of John MacLeod decided to marry, contrary to Rainy's ruling and to make an example of him, he was removed from his father's house, then fled to stay in a sheep cot, but that was set on fire as well and none of his friends or anybody else would dare to give him shelter for the night. Rainy cleared twelve townships of their inhabitants in total to set up sheep farming, with ninety-four Highland Scots families forced from the island, causing mass depopulation and displacement. The Scottish poet and Raasay- native Sorley MacLean authored the Scottish Gaelic poem Hallaig about the Rainy years on Raasay. Retrieved on 20 March 2019. Personal life George Rainy was married three times; Retrieved on 20 March 2019. firstly to Margaret Jessie Louisa Darroch, the daughter of Lieutenant General Duncan Darroch, 2nd Baron of Gourock from the Glengarry Fencibles. She died without issue in 1840. After this, Rainy took Elizabeth Haygarth as his second wife, she was the daughter of Rev. George Haygarth, she died in 1856. The couple did have a child together, Rainy's one and only son; George Haygarth Rainy (1845‚Äî1872), he died in his 20s without issue. Thirdly, Rainy married Isabella Rudlin, the widow of the Rev. George Hingston. No issue came from this marriage. After the death of George Haygarth Rainy the trustees of his estate disposed the Rainy controlled lands in the Inner Hebrides in favour of George Grant MacKay of Rosehall and Oban.

Early life Cichero was born in Venezuela and grew up in Norman, Oklahoma from preschool age until third grade, where his father worked as a soccer coach. He then moved to Spain, where he played at soccer academies in Valencia, before returning to the United States in 2011, following his mother's death. He attended Norman North High School and in 2013, he was named as the Oklahoman All-City Player of the Year. He was named the Gatorade Oklahoma Boys Soccer Player of the Year in 2013 and 2014. College career Coming out of high school, he was considered Oklahoma's top prospect from the 2014 graduating class. He decided to attend Southern Methodist University and join their soccer program. Cichero was a standout performer for SMU during his four year college career. As a freshman, he was named to the ACC Second Team and the All-Rookie Team. In his sophomore season in 2015, he was named the AAC Offensive Player of the Year, was named to the NCAA Division I First-Team All-America, and was a semi- finalist for the MAC Hermann Trophy, which is awarded to the top college soccer player of the year.

Life  Born in W√ºrzburg, the son of a factory owner, Gembruch passed his Abitur at the Heinrich-von-Gagern-Gymnasium in Frankfurt am Main in 1937. Afterwards he performed Reich Labour Service for six months. He started a military career. In November 1942 he became a British prisoner of war in El-Alamein. He taught Latin in a so-called camp university. He studied history, German and philosophy at the Goethe University Frankfurt. His academic teacher was Otto Vossler. He received his doctorate in 1950 with a thesis on Otto von Bismarck. Gembruch was Vossler's assistant until 1956. In the meantime he had been promoted to Major in the Bundeswehr. After the end of his assistant position he changed for financial reasons to the Military History Research Office in Freiburg im Breisgau. There he worked as a lifetime civil servant, among other things on the development of curricula for officer schools. However, he continued to publish scientific articles, especially in the journal '. Gembruch habilitated in Frankfurt in 1960 with a thesis on Heinrich Friedrich Karl vom und zum Stein. In view of his outstanding habilitation, the Faculty of Philosophy in Frankfurt offered him a postdoctoral lectureship. He thereupon decided to swap his secure career for the less lucrative and less secure career at the university. In the winter semester of 1960/61 he took up his teaching activities at the University of Frankfurt. In April 1965 he was appointed full professor there. Gembruch retired in 1986.

Opened in 1981, it is currently located at Calle F√©lix de Amesti 367 in the city of Las Condes, Santiago Province. History The Philippines did not initially open a resident mission in Chile when diplomatic relations between the two countries were established in 1947 ‚Äî the first Southeast Asian country to do so. While Chile opened its embassy in Manila in December 1967, the Philippine Embassy in Buenos Aires initially represented the Philippines in Chile, with Ambassador Luis Moreno Salcedo being accredited to Chile on March 23, 1963. A resident Philippine embassy in Santiago would not be opened until 1981, during the presidency of Ferdinand Marcos, when Rodolfo A. Arizala was appointed the Philippines' first resident ambassador to Chile. Notably, when Arizala arrived in Santiago on August 21, 1981 to assume his post, he was initially billeted at the Hotel Carrera by the central Plaza de la Constituci√≥n, which today houses the offices of Chile's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, while scouting locations for the chancery and ambassadorial residence. The hotel manager, a retired general who in his youth had played basketball against Ambrosio Padilla during the 1936 Summer Olympics as part of its men's basketball team and who had since befriended him, offered the hotel as his residence for the duration of his tenure at a significant discount. In 2016, a number of groups led by the Fundaci√≥n Daya organized a protest outside the Embassy against the policies of President Rodrigo Duterte and the Philippine Drug War, which they also organized again the following year as part of a worldwide campaign to reform global drug policy. Staff and activities The Philippine Embassy in Santiago is currently headed by Ambassador Ma. Teresita C. Daza, who was appointed to the position by President Duterte on November 28, 2018. The post had been vacant for at least the last 1.5 years before her appointment, a point which Chilean Ambassador Jose Miguel Capdevila had raised with Foreign Affairs Secretary Alan Peter Cayetano as the two countries were restarting free trade agreement talks. Prior to becoming Ambassador, Daza, a career diplomat, had most recently been deployed to the Philippine Embassy in New Delhi as ambassador to India. Her appointment was confirmed by the Commission on Appointments on February 6, 2019, and Daza arrived in Santiago to assume her post just over two months later. The Santiago mission is one of the Philippines' smaller diplomatic missions, with only seven staff members. Many of the Embassy's activities center around promoting Filipino interests and strengthening cultural and economic ties between the Philippines and Chile, particularly considering the country's relatively small number of resident Filipinos. These include donating books on Philippine history and culture to a number of local libraries, organizing cultural exhibits and lectures on Jos√© Rizal at the University of Santiago, Chile, and promoting the Philippines as a tourist destination for Chileans. However, while it does conduct outreach to the local community, results can be mixed: it was reported that no Filipinos in Chile voted in the 2016 general election in the first week of voting, although bad weather may have played a role. In addition to activities in Chile, the Embassy exercises jurisdiction over Ecuador and Peru, where it has conducted outreach activities to provide consular services to Filipinos based in those countries.

Emigre and Spy Nazarenko was born in Starocherkasskaya in the territory of the Don Cossack Host. The Don Cossacks in common with the other Cossack Hosts of the Russian empire were a privileged group, being granted exemption from taxation, allowed to own their own land and to elect most of the officials of the Host government (through not the ataman who headed the Host who was always appointed by the Emperor) in exchange for serving as one of the main bulwarks of the House of Romanov. The culture of the Cossacks was centered around riding horses and warfare. For a certain period of time every year, the men of the Host had to leave their farms to serve in the Imperial Russian Army as irregular cavalry or alternatively as a para-military police force in one of the provinces of the vast Russian empire, which served to increase the popular identification of the Cossacks as one of the most important bulwarks of the system . In 1913, the 2 million people of the Don Cossack Host owned 13 of the 17 million hectares of the land by the banks of the river Don and whose income was double that of a typical Russian muzhik (peasant). The Don Cossacks spoke their own dialect of Russian and the men dressed in distinctive colorful uniforms, which marked them out. Every Host had its own uniform, but a common aspect of all Cossack uniforms was that the men wore a gazyr (a bullet carrying vest), a wool hat known as the papakha and carried around a type of sword called the shashka. The Cossack Hosts who had long owned their land quickly came into conflict with the new Bolshevik regime, and all of the atamans committed their Hosts to fight for the White Army in the Russian Civil War. In 1918 Nazarenko's family fled to Romania. Nazarenko grew up in Romania and subsequently enlisted in the Romanian Army. Owing to his Russian language skills, he was recruited as a spy for Romania. Nazarenko was sent on an espionage mission for Romania into the Soviet Union in 1933, but was captured crossing the Dniester river at night and imprisoned. After escaping from prison, Nazarenko settled in Taganrog in 1935. Taganrog was in the traditional territory of the Don Cossack Host, and many of the local people were hostile to the Soviet regime. Using an assumed name, Nazarenko was able to take command of a Don Cossack militia being sent to support the Red Army in the fall of 1941. At the factory he worked in, a militia was recruited to fight for the Red Army, and Nazarenko had enough knowledge of military matters to be given command with the rank of First Lieutenant. Nazarenko subverted his workers' militia unit and persuaded them to fight for Germany instead. The fact that most of the men in the workers' militia were fellow Don Cossacks who had lost their land under the Soviet regime greatly assisted Nazarenko with persuading his unit to switch sides. World War Two As German forces approached the Mius river, Nazarenko's workers' militia company attacked the Red Army. Nazarenko and his men were positioned on the second line, and seeing the Wehrmacht was close by, he gave the orders to attack the Red Army's first line. In October 1941, the XIV Panzer Corps of the Wehrmacht discovered that the 9th Soviet Army was engaged in battle against a Cossack formation led by Nazarenko, which surprised them. After being relieved by the Wehrmacht, Nazarenko and his 80 surviving men were sent to the rear. Nazarenko met General Gustav von Wietersheim and insisted to him that his loyalties were to Germany. Nazarenko argued that he wanted to overthrow the Soviet regime and he saw Operation Barbarossa as the beginning of the \\"liberation\\" of his people. Nazarenko and his men were enlisted into the Wehrmacht as a reconnaissance battalion, wearing German uniforms with the words Kosaken stamped on them. On 23 October 1941, Nazarenko and his men formally took an oath of loyalty to Adolf Hitler, swearing he would obey he would obey and fight for Hitler for the rest of his life. Nazarenko was given a German officer's peaked hat, which he altered by the removing the red, white and black roundle and replacing it with the blue and white of the Don Cossack Host. He followed the XIV Panzer corps to Rostov and was shortly transferred over to the 1st Panzer Army. The Cossack Reconnaissance Battalion was primarily used for anti-partisan duties and for guarding Red Army POWs, and was judged to be successful in performing these duties. The Cossack units serving with the Wehrmacht had an extremely brutal reputation when it came to anti-partisan duties, being used to do \\"dirty work\\" that the Germans did not wish to do themselves such as shooting Jews. In February 1942, Alexander Siusiukin, a Don Cossack serving in the Red Army contacted the Wehrmacht, saying many of his fellow Don Cossacks viewed Hitler as a liberator and were prepared to do anything to assist in Germany's victory. Siuskukin was put into touch with Nazarenko and a means of communication were opened. By 1942, Nazarenko, through his rank was only first lieutenant was commanding a force of 500 men. On 14 October 1942, Nazarenko attended Pokrov, the Orthodox feast honoring the Intercession of the Theotokos by the Virgin Mary with Altman Pavlov. After Pokrov, Nazarenko toured the countryside dressed in a uniform combining aspects of the traditional Cossack dress such as wearing a gazyr and a papakha while carrying a shashka together with the German uniform, praising Hitler as a \\"liberator\\". Alfred Rosenberg, the Minister of the East (Ostministerium), favored an approach called \\"political warfare\\" in order to \\"to free the German Reich from Pan-Slavic pressure for centuries to come\\". Under Rosenberg's \\"political warfare\\" approach, the Soviet Union was to be broken up into four nominally independent states consisting of the Ukraine; a federation in the Caucasus; an entity to be called Ostland which would comprise the Baltic states and Belorussia (modern Belarus); and a rump Russian state. Rosenberg was a fanatical anti- Semite and a Russophobe, but he favored a more diplomatic policy towards the non-Russian and non-Jewish population of the Soviet Union, arguing that this was a vast reservoir of manpower that could be used by the Reich. Initially, Rosenberg considered the Cossacks to be Russians, and he ascribed to the popular German stereotype of Cossacks as thuggish rapists and looters. However, as the numbers of Cossacks rallying to the Reich continued to grow into 1942, Roseberg changed his opinion, deciding that the Cossacks were not Russians after all, instead being a separate \\"race\\" descended from the Goths. The Ostministerium was supported by the SS, whose \\"racial experts\\" had concluded by 1942 the Cossacks were not Slavs, but rather the descendants of the Ostgoths and thus were Aryans. Rosenberg decided that after the \\"final victory\\" Germany would establish a new puppet state to be called Cossackia in the traditional territories of the Don, Kuban, Terek, Askrakhan, Ural and Orenburg Hosts in southeastern Russia. Most of the Cossack leaders such as General Pyotr Krasnov tended to reject the concept of \\"Cossackia\\", but since it was German policy to promote \\"Cossackia\\", they had little choice in the matter. Nazarenko seems to be one of the Cossack leaders to actually embrace the idea of \\"Cossackia\\". In August 1943, Nazarenko's company of 500 was incorporated into the 1st Cossack Cavalry Division, which was formed and trained in Mielau (modern M≈Çawa, Poland). When the 1st Cossack Division was formed, Nazarenko was given soldbuch (paybook) number 1 in recognition for being the first of the first Cossack to fight for Germany. The soldbuch had considerable symbolical significance in the Wehrmacht and being awarded a soldbuch with a high number was a mark of trust. By the summer of 1943, Nazarenko was involved in a relationship with a German woman living in Mielau. One of her neighbors denounced her for sleeping with a Slav, leading to her arrest by the Gestapo. Nazarenko complained to his commander, General Helmuth von Pannwitz, saying he had been faithful to his oath to Hitler and had been fighting for the Reich for almost two years. Through Pannwitz was able to use his influence to have the woman released, the incident had soured her enough to cause her to end the relationship. Nazarenko later stated that Pannwitz wanted \\"the creation of an unified spirit\\" in the 1st Cossack Division and tried to encourage his officers to treat the Cossacks with respect. Pannwitz put Nazarenko in charge of a counter-intelligence unit to investigate Soviet spies in the 1st Cossack Division. The 1st Cossack Division was sent not in the Soviet Union as expected, but instead to Bosnia and Croatia. When the Cossack Division was transferred from the Wehrmacht to the Waffen-SS, Nazarenko also became a part of the SS. Nazarenko served as a translator and an interrogator of POWS for the Wehrmacht and SS in Romania in 1944. Nazarenko was accused of executing Red Army POWs and of hanging Jews from the lampposts in Odessa, claims which he denied, through he stated in an interview that Jews were his \\"ideological enemies\\". In 1944 while living in Belgrade, Nazarenko married the daughter of General Vyacheslav Naumenko, the ataman of the Kuban Cossack Host. Towards the end of World War Two, Nazarenko was in Berlin serving as the intelligence chief for the Cossack \\"government-in-exile\\" set up by Alfred Rosenberg and headed by Pyotr Krasnov. At the end of World War Two, Nazarenko was in Munich and was not repatriated by the Americans to the Soviets. From 1945 to 1949, Nazarenko worked in Bavaria for the U.S Army Counter-Intelligence Corps, being used as a translator and an investigator into possible Soviet agents living in the Displaced Persons camps. Republican Activist In 1949, he immigrated to the United States, living at various locations in the New York-New Jersey area. In the United States, Nazarenko founded and led the Cossack War Veterans' Association made up of veterans of the 1st Cossack Division. A number of Cossacks who served in the Ostlegionen and the Waffen-SS ended settling in Australia, where they were welcomed as almost matching the Australian ideal of the perfect immigrant as they were white, Christian and anti-Communist with the only black mark against being that they were not Anglo-Irish. Australia came to take in a very number of the Cossacks after 1945, being one of the main destinations for Cossack refugees. Nazarekno spent much time visiting Australia after 1950 to maintain contacts with the Cossacks living there. As the organiser of the annual Captive Nations day parade held every July in New York starting in 1960, Nazarenko had a certain degree of local prominence. In the 1968 and 1972 elections, Nazarenko campaigned for the Republican candidate, Richard Nixon in his capacity as the president of the Cossack American Republican National Federation. At some point, Nazarenko became involved with the Anti-Bolshevik Bloc of Nations (ABN). In 1969, ABN Correspondence, the journal of the ABN, listed him on its Board of Directors as the Organization Representative for the \\"Cossackian War Veterans\\". In 1969, Nixon founded the National Republican Heritage Groups Council, whose first president was a Hungarian immigrant, Laszlo Pasztor, who began his political career as an activist for the fascist Arrow Cross movement in his native Hungary. The National Republican Heritage Groups Council was designed to reach out to so-called ethnic communities in the United States on behalf of the Republican Party with a special focus on reaching Americans of Eastern European background. Pasztor had much success in the 1968 election as a Republican activist working in neighborhoods inhabited by Eastern European immigrants or the descendants of Eastern European immigrants, leading Nixon to make the Heritage Group a permanent part of the Republican Party. Pasztor in turn recruited Nazarenko into the Heritage Groups Council. The Heritage Croup Council was founded at a conference in Washington D.C. held between 29‚Äì31 October 1969, with Nixon speaking to the founders at the White House on 30 October 1969. Nazarenko attended the conference, where he was listed as representing the Cossacks. ABN Correspondence described Nazarenko as representing both \\"Cossackia\\" and the American Friends of the ABN at the 1969 conference. In 1974, Nazarenko had given himself the rank of colonel and was listed as one of the leaders of the Captive Nations field committee in New York state, where according to Nixon's papers, his address was 21 S Weatern Highway, Blauvelt, New York. The American scholar Leonard Weinberg described the recruitment of activists such as Pasztor and Nazarenko into the Republican Party in the late 1960s as the beginning of a tilt towards a more right-wing stance within the GOP. Several other members of the National Republican Heritage Groups Council, whose members were mostly Eastern European had connections to fascist causes such as the Romanian-American Florian Galdau who served in the Legion of the Archangel Michael (the Iron Guard) in his native Romania, the Slovak-American Met Balco who organised \\"annual commemorations of the Slovak Nazi regime\\", the Ukrainian-American Bohdan Fedorak who was a member of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN) and whose wartime past was \\"questionable\\", and the Bulgarian-American Radi Slavoff who had been a member of a fascist group in Bulgaria. The American scholar Jaimee A. Swift wrote the 25 members of the National Republican Heritage Groups Council were almost exclusively concerned with foreign policy and rarely addressed domestic issues. She also noted that despite the stated purpose of the Council to improve outreach by the Republican Party to ethnic minorities that the council never had Jewish or Afro-American members, and most of the members of the National Republican Heritage Groups Council had links to the World Anti-Communist League. In 1972, Nazarenko converted the Cossack War Veterans' Association into the World Federation of the Cossack National Liberation Movement of Cossackia. Nazarenko took part in Captive Nations day parades in his Cossack uniform and as the president of the Cossack American Republican National Federation was active in Republican politics. The Austrian-born American author Julius Epstein described Nazarenko in the early 1970s as living in a modest house in New York together with his wife and father-in-law Naumenko. In 1978, Nazarenko dressed in his blue Don Cossack uniform led the Captive Days day parade in New York city, and he told a journalist: \\"Cossackia is a nation of 10 million people. In 1923 the Russians officially abolished Cossackia as a nation. Officially, it no longer exists...America should not spend billions supporting the Soviets with trade. We don't have to be afraid of the Russian army because half of it is made up of Captive Nations. They can never trust the rank and file\\". The journalist Hal McKenzie described Nazarenko as having \\"cut a striking figure with his white fur cap, calf-length coat with long silver-sheathed dagger and ornamental silver cartridge cases on his chest.\\" On 21 July 1984, Nazarenko, gave a speech at a diner for the Captive Nations Committee in New York. Nazarenko began by praising those who fought for Nazi Germany in the Ostlegionen and the Waffen-SS as heroes. Turning to his main subject, Nazarenko stated: \\"There is a certain ethnic group that makes its home in Israel. This ethnic group works with the Communists all the time. They were the Fifth Column in Germany and in all the Captive Nations...They would spy, sabotage and do any act in the interest of Moscow. Of course there had to be the creation of a natural self defense against this Fifth Column. They had to be isolated. Security was needed. So the Fifth Column were arrested and imprisoned. This particular ethnic group was responsible for aiding the Soviet NKVD. A million of our people were destroyed as a result of them aiding the NKVD...You hear a lot about the Jewish Holocaust, but what about the 140 million Christians, Moslems and Buddhists killed by Communism? That is the real Holocaust and you never hear about it!\\". The audience roared it approval and Nazarenko's speech was the best received of the evening. On 17 May 1985, he attended a speech given by President Ronald Reagan at a meeting of the Republican Heritage Groups Council at the Omni Shoreham Hotel representing the Cossack American Republican National Federation. The next day, Nazarenko was interviewed by the American journalist Russ Bellant. Before Bellant, Nazarenko produced a briefcase full of anti-Semitic literature on the \\"Jewish question\\", Cossack publications and memorabilia from his service in the Wehrmacht and the Waffen-SS. Bellant described Nazarenko as a muscular man standing 6'1 with a flamboyant mustache and an unnatural energy for a man of his age together with an immense capacity to consume vodka, to chain-smoke and to express his raging hatred for Jews and Russians. In common with many other Cossack emigres, Nazarenko insisted the Cossacks were a distinctive nation who were not Russians despite speaking Russian. Nazarenko told Bellant that Jews were his \\"ideological enemies\\", claiming that Jews invented Communism to oppress Gentiles, and that he was proud to have fought for Nazi Germany. Nazarenko when questioned, denied the Holocaust, saying that \\"Jews didn't die from gas chambers. Those mountains of bones are from people who staved to death or died of disease\\". In 2014, Bellant recalled: \\"I interviewed the Cossack guy; he showed me his pension from service in the SS in World War II, and how he was affiliated with free Nazi groups in the United States, and he was just very unrepentant.\\" Nazarenko also told Bellant that he was in contact with \\"patriotic\\" publications such as Thunderbolt (a white supremacist magazine edited by Edward Reed Fields), The Spotlight and Instauration, submitting them articles. Nazarenko lived comfortably on a veteran's pension provided by the West German government. Nazarenko boosted to Bellant that when meeting Nazis: \\"They respect me because I was a former German Army officer. Sometimes when I meet these guys, they say 'Heil Hitler!'\\". Much of Nazarenko's time in the 1980s was taken up with trying to discredit the Office of Special Investigations, the branch of the Justice Department responsible for investigating accused Nazi war criminals living in the United States, which he called part of a \\"Communist\\" plot to deport him from the United States. In an article in the New York Times in 1988, Bellant asked for the Republican Party to expel Nazarenko. In late 1988, Nazarenko was expelled from the GOP together with 7 other ethnic organizers with Nazi ties. However, Nazarenko was allowed to remain a member of the Republican Heritage Groups Council, which in effect allowed to retain his Republican party membership. By 1989, Nazarenko was allowed to resume his Republican Party membership. Books and articles    * External links *Will Bush Purge Nazi Collaborators from the GOP? *George H.W.

Dating from 1742, it was built for George Wynne, the design being attributed to Francis Smith. Construction reputedly cost ¬£40,000. The hall is a Grade II* listed building. To the northwest of the hall stand the White Gates, which have their own Grade I listing. The gates terminate the view from the hall across the lawns, an early and rare example of 18th century parkland design by Stephen Switzer, and a Grade I listed landscape of national significance. History George Wynne was born in 1700 into a family of impoverished North Wales gentry. His fortunes were transformed when lead was rediscovered on the Halkyn Mountain estate he had inherited from his mother. After protracted litigation with his father, Wynne secured control of the mine, embarked on a political career, and spent some ¬£40,000 on building a house and estate befitting his new status. His architect for the house was Francis Smith of Warwick and for the park, Stephen Switzer. A supporter of Robert Walpole, he received a baronetcy and served as High Sheriff of Flintshire in 1722-1724. He was later nearly ruined by falling receipts from his mines, and lavish expenditure on his estate, spending some time incarcerated as a debtor in the King's Bench Prison. He died in poverty in 1756. In the late 18th century, the house was in the possession of the Reverend Hope Eyton, whose descendants were still resident in the early 1980s. Rev. Eyton remodelled the hall, considerably reducing its scale by the demolition of two large wings. Most of the interior decoration dates from this time. Architecture and description The current house is of eight bays, and two storeys, the third having been removed in the alterations undertaken by Rev. Eyton. The main construction material is red brick, faced with cement render. The interior contains some 18th century plasterwork and fireplaces, but most of the decoration, including an imperial staircase dates from the Regency era. Parkland and pleasure grounds The White Gates The park at Leeswood Hall is of \\"national importance\\" as an early 18th century landscape designed by Stephen Switzer. The grounds lie mainly to the north of the hall and terminate in the White Gates, which have been attributed both Robert Davies and to Robert Bakewell. The gates are listed Grade I. The gates were originally flanked by two lodges or pavilions but these were moved to either side of the Black Gates on the Mold road after 1809. The Black Gates in situ as at 2020 are not original, these having been re-sited to a building called The Tower on the outskirts of Mold. The lodges have their own Grade II* listing. To the west of the hall is a large mound, known as The Mount. By local tradition, this is the motte of a motte-and- bailey castle. There is no archaeological or documentary evidence for this claim, and it is possible that it was created by Switzer as a garden feature. It has two canopied stone chairs, from an original set of four, and a stone table at its summit. The park contains many other historic structures, in varying states of preservation. The ice house, stables, dovecote and walled garden all have their own Grade II listings.

There was another Amata, who was healed by St. Dominic when he cast out seven devils from her, but it was probably not this Amata. Her name has been removed from the Latin martyrology.

She and Cecilia were from the monastery at San Sisto Vecchio in Rome, during the time of St. Dominic's reforms, which he convinced her to enter. In 1224, he either sent her with the other two nuns, during a time of reform, to Bologna to found St. Agnes Convent, or he was instrumental in allowing her to stay both there and at San Sisto.

Personal life A native of Sarnia, Ontario, Golob moved to Calgary in January 2019 specifically to prepare for the upcoming federal election and seek to unseat incumbent Prime Minister Justin Trudeau who has held himself as one of the foremost advocates for abortion in Canada. Golob was herself nearly aborted as her mother was a teenager who unexpectedly became pregnant and was medically advised to abort her daughter but ignored medical advice. As a young teenager Golob saw a photograph of an aborted child, and was determined to act to prevent similar actions in the future. In addition to her activism, she volunteers with Big Sisters and Out of the Cold. Professional career Originally working as the Youth Coordinator for the Campaign Life Coalition, She has been interviewed by the CBC, CTV, the Huffington Post, Toronto Star, MTV and other organisations. She has received \\"violent hate mail\\" as a result of her activism, but notes that she is sympathetic to the authors because they are often reaching out from the pain they have internalized following an abortion. In 2015, she appeared at the United Nations for the 57th Commission on the Status of Women with a pro-life delegation.

The film was financed by M. S. Suresh babu under Swathi Cine Arts and had music scored and composed by Sax Raja. The film stars Devaraj in the titular role alongside Bhavya, Avinash, Shanti and Padma Kumta. The film follows a young man who after an accident loses his memory and comes across different people addressing him by two different names. While one name offers family and protection the other causes trouble. How the man confirms his identity and retraces his lost memory forms the crux of the story.

When the car crashes into a tree, a police jeep which passesby notices him and takes him to the hospital. Inspector Rajasekhar who happened to be there in the jeep learns from the doctor that the accident caused a major head injury for the person resulting in temporary memory loss. In order to find who he is, Rajasekhar publishes his photo in all the major newspapers. The next day three people arrive. The first person is a young woman, Kavitha, who claims to be the victim, Keerthi's girlfriend. Danappa, the second person tells he is Keerthi's father while the third one, an inspector calls Keerthi a wanted criminal. However, the three of them not knowing each other arises suspicion in the mind of Rajasekhar who believes the person (perhaps Keerthi) is faking his memory loss and hence places a microphone beneath his bed. One night he is attacked by some mysterious person after Keerthi fails to provide information regarding some black diary. After another attack, Keerthi runs away from the hospital not intending to meet any of them again causing Rajasekhar to believe that he has been abducted. While walking aimlessly he comes across Swathi, a small girl, who calls him her father and takes him to her house where her grandmother calls him as Pruthvi, her only son. This fact is refuted by Pruthvi's wife, Madhavi who claims to have cremated her own husband. She reveals how he went missing on a picnic forcing them to inform the police who takes her to a hospital morgue the very next day only for her to discover her husband's corpse. This happened a few days back. However, she is forced to keep him there as both Swathi and her mother-in-law refuses to believe her. Keerthi/Pruthvi begins to have a paternal relation with Swathi which disturbs Madhavi who asks him to go out. As he moves on again , aimlessly and hopelessly, he comes across Menagha, who happens to be one of those queer agents sent by some Boss to retrieve the Black Diary. After escaping from them he returns to Pruthvi's house where Madhavi asks him to stay there until Swathi gets to know the truth. Meanwhile, Police Constable Siddharama posing as a beggar traces Pruthvi/Keerthi's location and informs Rajasekhar who makes a visit to the house right away. With Madhavi's help Pruthvi/Keerthi somewhat convinces Rajasekhar that he is Pruthvi. One day when they travel to temple, Pruthvi/Keerthi runs back to the house upon seeing Kavitha. A few agents who had followed Pruthvi/Keerthi to the temple kidnaps Swathi ordering Madhavi to ask Keerthi to handover the black diary. They give their location. Keerthi/Pruthvi heads to that place only to be captured and tortured. Rajasekhar, in the meantime, contacts Kavitha and Danappa and sends them to Pruthvi's house where Danappa recognises Pruthvi's mother as his late master's wife and reveals Keerthi to be Pruthvi's twin brother. The story cuts to a flashback. Two crime lords, Giridhar and Chakravarthy(Boss), attacks Maheshwarappa, the father of Pruthvi and Keerthi, and Danappa after Maheshwarappa, an honest police officer, arrests and humiliates them. They leave after asking their henchmen to put the house on fire. Danappa manages to escape with Keerthi while Pruthvi and his mother who had gone to the nearby temple returns to see the burning mansion believing all the three of them to be dead. Confirming that the person is Keerthi, Rajasekhar decides to travel to the mysterious location of Chakravarthy with armed forces. Keerthi who gets a major blow on his head from one of Chakravarthy's henchman regains his memory. On the day of picnic when Pruthvi went to fetch some water he came across an injured Keerthi. The latter recognises Pruthvi as his elder twin brother and convinces about how he is his estranged brother. Keerthi narrates that he was raised by Danappa after their father got killed with the sole intention of avenging his murder. As an adult, he manages to be a loyal member of Chakravarthy's gang and after killing Giridhar flees with the mysterious Black Diary which contains the complete information regarding Chakravarthy's global crime syndicate. He is, however, chased by the latter's goons who shoot him forcing him to take shelter there. Before passing away he gives the Black Diary to Pruthvi asking him to hand over it to the Government authorities. While trying to escape from Chakravarthy's goons Pruthvi comes across an Ambassador car and escapes in that. It was after this that he met with the accident. Confirming that he is Pruthvi, he breaks free from captivity and kills Chakravarthy's goons. After saving his daughter he thrashes Chakravarthy. Rajasekhar who arrives with Pruthvi's family and the police prevents Pruthvi from killing Chakravarthy. Pruthvi reveals the truth to everyone and reveals to Chakravarthy that he is Maheshwarappa's son. Kavitha sacrifices her life to protect Pruthvi from one of Chakravarthy's severely wounded henchman. Pruthvi reveals to Rajasekhar that the Black Diary is hidden in the ceiling of the Ambassador car he had driven that day. The family is reunited.

Context The Egyptians and Kushites had begun agitating peoples within the Assyrian empire in an attempt to gain a foothold in the region. As a result, in 701 BCE, Hezekiah of Judah, Lule king of Sidon, Sidka, king of Ascalon and the king of Ekron formed an alliance with Egypt against Assyria. The Neo-Assyrian ruler Sennacherib (705‚Äì681 BC) attacked the rebels, conquering Ascalon, Sidon and Ekron and defeating the Egyptians and driving them from the region. He marched toward Jerusalem, destroying 46 towns and villages (including the heavily defended city of Lachish) in his path. This is graphically described in Isaiah 10; exactly what happened next is unclear (the Bible says an angel of the Lord killed 185,000 Assyrian soldiers at Jerusalem after Hezekiah prayed in the temple).II Kings 18‚Äì19 There are various theories (Taharqa's army, disease, divine intervention, Hezekiah's surrender, Herodotus' mice theory) as to why the Assyrians failed to take Jerusalem and withdrew to Assyria. Sennacherib's account says Judah paid him tribute and he left. In 681 BCE, Sennacherib was murdered while praying to the god Nisroch by one or more of his own sons (allegedly named Adremelech, Abimlech, and Sharezer), perhaps as retribution for his destruction of Babylon.According to 2 Kings 19:37, while praying to the god Nisroch, he was killed by two of his sons, Adramalech, and Sharezer, and both of these sons subsequently fled to Urartu; this is repeated in Isaiah 37:38 and alluded to in 2 Chronicles 32:21. Invasion of Esarhaddon (673 BCE) Relief from the Temple of Amun, Jebel Barkal, showing Kushites defeating Assyrians Esarhaddon (ruled 681‚Äì669 BCE), the son of Sennacherib, led several campaigns against Taharqa of Egypt, which he recorded on several monuments. His first attack in 677 BCE, aimed at pacifying Arab tribes around the Dead Sea, led him as far as the Brook of Egypt. Campaign of 673 BCE Statue of Kushite ruler Taharqa, who led the fight against the Assyrians. Kerma Museum. Esarhaddon then raided Egypt in 673 BCE. This invasion, which only a few Assyrian sources discuss, ended in what some scholars have assumed was possibly one of Assyria's worst defeats.' Taharqa and his army defeated the Assyrians outright in 674 BC, according to Babylonian records. The Egyptians had for years sponsored rebels and dissenters in Assyria and Esarhaddon had hoped to storm Egypt and take this rival out in one fell swoop. Because Esarhaddon had marched his army at great speed, the Assyrians were exhausted once they arrived outside the Egyptian-controlled city of Ashkelon, where they were defeated by the Kushite Pharaoh Taharqa. Following this defeat, Esarhaddon abandoned his plan to conquer Egypt for the moment and withdrew back to Nineveh.' Campaign of 671 BCE Two years later Esarhaddon launched a full invasion. In the early months of 671 BC, Esarhaddon again marched against Egypt.' The army assembled for this second Egyptian campaign was considerably larger than the one Esarhaddon had used in 673 and he marched at a much slower speed in order to avoid the problems that had plagued his previous attempt.' On his way he passed through Harran, one of the major cities in the western parts of his empire. Here, a prophecy was revealed to the king, which predicted that Esarhaddon's conquest of Egypt would be a successful one. According to a letter sent to Ashurbanipal after Esarhaddon's death, the prophecy was the following: The Victory stele of Esarhaddon (now in the Pergamon Museum) was created following the king's victory in Egypt and depicts Esarhaddon in a majestic pose with a war mace in his hand and a vassal king kneeling before him. Also present is Ushankhuru, the small son of the defeated pharaoh Taharqa, kneeling and with a rope around his neck. Ushankhuru, the captive son of Taharqa, as depicted by the Assyrians on the Victory stele of Esarhaddon Three months after having received this prophecy, Esarhaddon's forces were victorious in their first battle with the Egyptians. Despite the prophecy and initial success, Esarhaddon was not convinced of his own safety. Just eleven days after he had defeated the Egyptians, he performed the \\"substitute king\\" ritual, an ancient Assyrian method intended to protect and shield the king from imminent danger announced by some sort of omen. Esarhaddon had performed the ritual earlier in his reign, but this time it left him unable to command his invasion of Egypt.'''''' In 671 BCE Esarhaddon took and sacked Memphis, where he captured numerous members of the royal family. Although the Pharaoh Taharqa had escaped to the south, Esarhaddon captured the Pharaoh's family, including his son and wife, and most of the royal court, which were sent back to Assyria as hostages. Esarhaddon reorganized the political structure in the north, governors loyal to the Assyrian king were placed in charge of the conquered territories, and he established Necho I as king at Sais. Upon Esarhaddon's return to Assyria he erected a stele alongside the previous Egyptian and Assyrian Commemorative stela of Nahr el-Kalb, as well as a victory stele at Zincirli H√∂y√ºk, showing Taharqa's young son Ushankhuru in bondage. The Babylonian Chronicles retells how Egypt \\"was sacked and its gods were abducted\\".ABC 1 Col.4:25; also in ABC 14:28‚Äì29 The conquest resulted in the relocation of a large number of Egyptians to the Assyrian heartland.' In an excerpt from the text inscribed on his victory stele, Esarhaddon describes the conquest with the following words: Upon the Assyrian king's departure, however, Taharqa intrigued in the affairs of Lower Egypt, and fanned numerous revolts. In 669 BC, Taharqa reoccupied Memphis, as well as the Delta, and recommenced intrigues with the king of Tyre. The Assyrian governors and local puppet rulers Esarhaddon had appointed over Egypt were obliged to flee the restive native populace who yearned for independence now that the Kushites and Nubians had been ejected. A new campaign was launched by Esarhaddon in 669 BCE. However, he became ill on the way and died. His elder son Shamash-shum-ukin became king of Babylon and his son Ashurbanipal became king of Assyria, with Ashurbanipal holding the senior position and Babylon subject to Nineveh.ABC 1 Col.4:30‚Äì33 and ABC 14:31‚Äì32, 37 Invasion of Ashurbanipal (667 BCE) Assyrian siege of an Egyptian fort, probably a scene from the war in 667 BCE referring to the capture of Memphis. Sculpted in 645 ‚Äì 635 BCE, under Ashurbanipal. British Museum. Ashurbanipal, or \\"Ashur-bani-apli\\" (Ashurbanapli, Asnapper), succeeded his father Esarhaddon to the throne. He continued to campaign in and to dominate Egypt, when not distracted by having to deal with pressures from the Medes to the east, and Cimmerians and Scythians to the north of Assyria. He installed a native Egyptian Pharaoh, Psammetichus, as a vassal king in 664 BCE. However, after Gyges of Lydia's appeal for Assyrian help against the Cimmerians was rejected, Lydian mercenaries were sent to Psammetichus. By 652 BCE, this vassal king was able to declare outright independence from Assyria with impunity, particularly as Ashurbanipal's older brother, Shamash-shum-ukin of Babylon, became infused with Babylonian nationalism, and began a major civil war in that year. However, the new dynasty in Egypt wisely maintained friendly relations with Assyria. Account of Ashurbanipal's campaign in Egypt against Taharqua (translation of the cuneiform, from the Rassam cylinder of Ashurbanipal). First campaign against Taharqa (667 BCE) Ashurbanipal defeated Taharqa in 667 BCE, who afterwards fled to Thebes. Ashurbanipal marched the Assyrian army as far south as Thebes, and sacked numerous revolting cities: As late as 665 BC, the vassal rulers of Sais, Mendes, and Pelusium were still making overtures to Taharqa in Kush. The rebellion was stopped and Ashurbanipal appointed as his vassal ruler in Egypt Necho I, who had been king of the city Sais, and Necho's son Psamtik I, who had been educated at the Assyrian capital of Nineveh during Esarhaddon's reign.' After his victory, Ashurbanipal left Egypt. Taharqa died in city of ThebesHistorical Prism inscription of Ashurbanipal I by Arthur Carl Piepkorn page 36.

Second campaign against Tantamani (663 BCE) Statue of Kushite ruler Tantamani, Kerma Museum. Egypt was still seen as vulnerable and Tantamani invaded Egypt in hopes of restoring his family to the throne. This led to a renewed conflict with Ashurbanipal in 663 BCE. Once the Assyrians had appointed Necho I as king and left Egypt, Tantamani marched down the Nile from Nubia and reoccupied all of Egypt including Memphis. Necho I, the Assyrians' representative, was killed in Tantamani's campaign. In reaction, the Assyrians led by Ashurbanipal returned to Egypt in force. Together with Psamtik I's army, which comprised Carian mercenaries, they fought a pitched battle in north Memphis, close to the temple of Isis, between the Serapeum and Abusir. Tantamani was defeated and fled to Upper Egypt but just 40 days after the battle, Ashurbanipal's army arrived in Thebes. Tantamani had already left the city for Kipkipi, a location that remains uncertain but might be Kom Ombo, some south of Thebes. The city itself was conquered \\"smashed (as if by) a floodstorm\\" and heavily plundered, in the Sack of Thebes. The event is not mentioned in Egyptian sources but is known from the Assyrian annals,Robert G. Morkot: The Black Pharaohs, Egypt's Nubian Rulers, London , p. 296 which report that the inhabitants were deported. The Assyrians took a large booty of gold, silver, precious stones, clothes, horses, fantastic animals, as well as two obelisks covered in electrum weighting 2.500 talents (c. 75.5 tons, or 166,500 lb): Ashurbanipal's Second Campaign in Egypt, in the Rassam cylinder Capture of Memphis by the Assyrians. The sack of Thebes was a momentous event that reverberated throughout the Ancient Near East. It is mentioned in the Book of Nahum chapter 3:8-10: A prophecy in the Book of Isaiah20:3-5 refers to the sack as well: The Assyrian reconquest effectively ended Nubian control over Egypt although Tantamani's authority was still recognised in Upper Egypt until his 8th Year in 656 BCE when Psamtik I's navy peacefully took control of Thebes and effectively unified all of Egypt. These events marked the start of the Twenty-sixth Dynasty of Egypt.

File:Egypto-Assyrian cylinder seal.jpgthumbEgypto-Assyrian cylinder seal, combining the Assyrian cuneiform script with Egyptian deities. Decline of the Neo-Assyrian Empire Psamtik I enters Ashdod. The new Egyptian Dynasty, having been installed by the Assyrians, remained on friendly terms with them. But the Neo-Assyrian empire began to disintegrate rapidly after a series of bitter civil wars broke out involving a number of claimants to the throne. While the Neo-Assyrian Empire was preoccupied with revolts and civil war over control of the throne, Psamtik I threw off his ties to the Assyrians circa 655 BCE, and formed alliances with King Gyges of Lydia, and recruited mercenaries from Caria and ancient Greece to resist Assyrian attacks. Assyria's vassal state of Babylonia took advantage of the upheavals in Assyria and rebelled under the previously unknown Nabopolassar, a member of the Chaldean tribe, in 625 BCE. What followed was a long war fought in the Babylonian heartland. In 605 BCE, a last Egyptian force fought the Babylonians at Battle of Carchemish, helped by the remnants of the army of the former Assyria, but this too met with defeat. A general called Ashur-uballit II was declared king of Assyria, and with belated military support from the Egyptian pharaoh Necho II, who wished to contain the westward advance of the Neo-Babylonian Empire, held out at Harran until 609 BCE.Grant, R G. Battle a Visual Journey Through 5000 Years of Combat. London: Dorling Kindersley, 2005 pg 19 Egyptian aid continued to the Assyrians, who desperately attempted to curb the increasing power of the Babylonians and Medes. In 609 BCE, at the Battle of Megiddo, an Egyptian force defeated a Judean force under king Josiah and managed to reach the last remnants of the Assyrian army. In a final battle at Harran in 609 BCE, the Babylonians and Medes defeated the Assyrian-Egyptian alliance, after which Assyria ceased to exist as an independent state. In 605 BCE, another Egyptian force fought the Babylonians (Battle of Carchemish), helped by the remnants of the army of the former Assyria, but this too met with defeat.

He was elected Member of Parliament (MP) in 1976, 1982 and 1983 in Rivi√®re des Anguilles and Souillac (Constituency No. 13). Early life and education Boodhoo attended the Camp Fouqueraux primary school and completed his School Certificate at Mauritius College, Curepipe. He worked as a labourer before attending Teachers‚Äô Training College. He then worked as a school teacher. Ancestry and family life In the 1800s Boodhoo's ancestors migrated from the state of Bihar in India. His father and mother were both Mauritians who worked as labourers on Highlands Sugar Estate. At the time of his birth Harish's father had already passed away and his mother continued to work as a labourer to support her six children. In 1973 Harish Boodhoo married school teacher Sarita Boodhoo and they have no children. Political career Boodhoo became involved with socio-cultural movement Siva Shivir in 1968 and he campaigned against the consumption of alcohol and cigarettes in Mauritian villages. In 1976 he was approached by Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam to join the Labour Party (Mauritius) (PTr). He was elected to the Legislative Assembly or National Assembly of Mauritius at the 1976 General Elections as part of the Independence Party (Mauritius) coalition government made up of Labour and CAM which allianced with rival PMSD after the elections. He represented Constituency No. 13 (Riviere des Anguilles and Souillac). From 1976 to 1979 Boodhoo served as a Labour-CAM-PMSD MP but he criticized various aspects of the ruling government. He was especially critical of the Minister of Finance Sir Veerasamy Ringadoo's budget and instigated a commission of enquiry in 1978 which led to the resignation of two sitting ministers Lutchmeeparsad Badry (Social Security) and Gyandeo Dabee (Cooperatives) in May 1979. Eventually Harish Boodhoo and two other Labour parliamentarians (Radha Gungoosingh and Rohit Beedassy) who supported him were dismissed from the Labour Party in late 1979. In December 1979 he formed a new party Parti Socialiste Mauricien (PSM) and was joined by other disgruntled members of the ruling Labour Party. In 1982 he formed a coalition with Mouvement Militant Mauricien (MMM) which won the 1982 General Elections. Harish Boodhoo became Deputy Prime Minister in the MMM-PSM government led by Prime Minister Aneerood Jugnauth. Whilst still in power there was disagreement within the ruling coalition of MMM-PSM which led to the departure of Aneerood Jugnauth and other elected members from MMM as he formed a new party MSM. At the same time Harish Boodhoo dissolved his party PSM so that all PSM parliamentarians could merge into the new party MSM in order to stay in power whilst distancing themselves from Paul B√©renger and his party MMM. He was Chief Whip until the 1983 General Elections. At the August 1983 elections Harish Boodhoo was elected under the MSM banner (part of the victorious MSM-Labour-PMSD coalition) at Constituency No. 13 (Riviere des Anguilles and Souillac). However he was dismissed from the MSM in 1986. He did not take part in the 1987 General Elections. In 1999 he relaunched the defunct party All Mauritius Hindu Congress (AMHC) which had originally been active from 1965 to 1968. Contributions and legacy Whilst in government Boodhoo campaigned for reform in the sugar industry, protection of public beaches from private ownership and fought against corruption. In 1979 two of his Labour Party colleagues (ministers Badry and Dabee) had to resign based on findings of a commission of enquiry (led by Victor Glover (judge)) which was instigated by Harish Boodhoo's corruption allegations. Since 2004 he has also publicly campaigned for legislative changes against the \\"Sale by Levy\\" system which had been abused by unscrupulous businessmen and lawyers to the detriment of numerous Mauritian borrowers. From 1979 to 1983 he published a daily newspaper Le Socialiste. Until 2008 Harish Boodhoo published newspaper Sunday Vani. Since 2011 Harish Boodhoo has produced daily articles on social media and since early 2020 these are complemented by a daily video clip. Controversies Boodhoo was sentenced and jailed numerous times following lawsuits involving allegations against judges and politicians. When found guilty he opted for jail time instead of paying the fines. He was criticised for suppressing press freedom when he was part of the ruling government. Following the 1982 general elections and when Mauritius was not yet a republic Basdeo Bissoondoyal refused Harish Boodhoo's offer to become the first President of a contemplated Republic of Mauritius.

In a local cooperative experience, players move objects from houses into a moving van while coping with exaggerated physics. The game was released for Microsoft Windows, Xbox One, Playstation 4, and Nintendo Switch on April 28, 2020.  Gameplay  Players in Moving Out take on the role of movers, moving marked furniture and appliances (such as couches, refrigerators, and microwaves) from a house to a moving truck under a time limit. Along the way, obstacles (such as rakes, fires, ice, and even ghosts) may be encountered. Some heavy objects require two people to move, while other objects are fragile and may be easily broken. Objects may be thrown. Players are ranked on a bronze, silver and gold scale, based on how quickly all of the objects are packed into the moving truck. The levels also have optional objectives, such as breaking all of the house's windows or packing an unmarked object. Additional bonus levels may also be unlocked. Moving Out features an \\"Assist Mode\\" feature, which helps reduce game difficulty. With this feature, the player can add extra time to the time limit, vanish objects on delivery, remove obstacles, make objects lighter. or even skip levels.

Similar shamanic narratives are known in mainland Korea as well, but are only occasionally referred to as bon-puri. The bon-puri is a formalistic genre of syllabic verse that tells the story of how the deity or deities being invoked came to hold their divine position. Their recitation is believed to please the gods and encourage their participation. There are three primary types of bon- puri. The general bon-puri, of which there are twelve, involve deities who are worshipped throughout the island, such as the goddess of childbirth or Gangnim the psychopomp. The village-shrine bon-puri number more than seventy, and center on patron gods of specific communities. The ancestral bon-puri, which are the least understood, feature the patron gods of specific family lineages or occupations; the god is not necessarily an ancestor. There is a small group of bon-puri narratives which are no longer performed by shamans and which do not clearly belong to one of the three above. These are called special bon- puri.  Etymology  Bon-puri is a compound of the Sino-Korean noun bon, meaning \\"origin,\\" and puri, the nominalized form of the verb pulda \\"to narrate.\\" The fundamental meaning of a bon-puri is thus the story of a deity's origins, i.e. how the deity being invoked came to hold their divine position. In some phrases pulda can also mean \\"to soothe,\\" and bon-puri may have the additional nuance of being a story that pleases the gods or soothes their dissatisfaction.  Ritual context  The bon-puri is always recited by shamans as part of gut rituals, where the shaman calls the gods into the human world in order to beseech their favor. Many bon-puri works explicitly state that the reason for the performance is to delight the gods and encourage their greater participation in the ritual, as in the following excerpt from the Chogong bon-puri: > By telling a god's origins, one makes the god giddy with delight By telling > a person's origins, one makes an enemy for a hundred years. In Jeju shamanism, humans are imperfect beings whose faults become clearer the more about them is known. By contrast, the venerated gods are exemplary beings, and to recount their deeds is to make their excellence known and thereby win their favor in the ritual. Shamans sing bon-puri while seated before and facing the sacrificial altar, and turn their back to the people. The bon-puri is always sung to the beat of the janggu drum.  Characteristics  The bon-puri is a genre of oral poetry. As no codified text exists, each shaman has their own versions of the bon-puri. However, a certain degree of consistency is expected. The ethnologist Chang Chu Keun cites one example of a Chogong bon-puri performance which was interrupted ten times by more experienced shamans, who repeatedly disputed the details given in the recitation and ultimately demanded that the performing shaman name the man who taught him. In extreme cases, the shaman may be replaced. Bon-puri performances are initiated by an announcement to the gods that the recitation is about to begin. This is followed by a request for the gods to descend to the ritual place, then by the genealogy of the gods being invoked. The example below is from the bon-puri of the god of the village of Tosan: > We present the nansusaeng of the Great House of the Seventh Day. May you > descend with full vigor to your native land... The mother of the Great House > of the Seventh Day's God is Lady Baekju from the Utson shrine, and his > father is Lord Grandfather Socheon-guk from the Alson shrine. First, second, > third, fourth, five, sixth‚Äîhe is the seventh son. The meter of the bon-puri is based on the number of syllables. The basic meter involves a line of two four-syllable feet, but lines where the first foot has three syllables and the second foot has five syllables are also frequent. The genre is also characterized by formulaic phrases often involving parallelism or repetition, which are found identically in many different works. For instance, many village-shrine bon-puri include the following sentence word-to- word in their conclusions, describing how the protagonist became a god that governs the lives of the villagers: > With a godly book more than an armful thick and a godly brush more than a > fistful thick, [the god] grinds ink for ten thousand pages in an inkstone > for three thousand pages... and takes charge of the town's jangjeok and > hojeok documents. Another stylistic feature of the bon-puri is the use of the emphatic present- tense in key moments of the narrative, marked by the verb-final suffix -go(na). This gives the impression that the story is being reenacted in the present day through the course of the ritual. The impression that the mythical past is being reenacted is strengthened by the use of long stretches of directly quoted dialogue, unbroken by narration. The example below is from the Samgong bon-puri: > \\"Eunjang-agi! Eunjang-agi! By whose grace do you eat rice and wash your face > with silver basins, wash your face with bronze basins?\\" \\"That is by my > father's grace, and also by my mother's grace.\\" \\"Our daughter knows what's > right. Go back to your room.\\" Many expressions in bon-puri are attested nowhere else in Jeju or Korean. For instance, the bon-puri poems refer to the guardian hounds of the gods as \\"the naguri of the courtyard, the naguri of the earth.\\" The precise meaning of many such expressions is unclear. Many bon-puri conclude by explaining the mythical reasons for specific facets of Jeju ritual life. For village-shrine bon-puri, the very last sentence is typically a formulaic invocation such as the following: > We raise our acclamation before the benevolent Lord of the Great House.  Types  There are three basic types of bon-puri: general, village-shrine, and ancestral. The twelve general bon-puri ( ) must be memorized by all shamans, and narrate the origins of gods who are worshipped throughout the island. The village-shrine bon-puri ( ) feature the patron gods of specific villages. Shamans memorize only the bon-puri of their own village and neighboring villages, sometimes because the gods of adjacent villages are considered to be close relatives. Finally, ancestral bon-puri ( ) involve deities (sometimes deified historical individuals) that are the patrons of a specific family or occupation. Ancestral bon-puri are memorized only by shamans who belong to the relevant family. Five bon-puri are commonly classified as special bon-puri ( ) because they do not fit neatly into the categories above and have unclear ritual significance. Shamans no longer recite any of the special bon-puri.  General bon-puri  There are twelve general bon-puri works. # Cheonji-wang bon-puri: The Jeju creation myth. In most versions, the creator god Cheonji-wang descends into the human world, either because the world had two suns and two moons which made life unlivable, or to punish the impiety of a man named Sumyeong-jangja. Cheonji-wang then sleeps with an earthly woman, who gives birth to the twins Daebyeol-wang and Sobyeol-wang. The twins ascend into heaven, meet their father, and engage in a flower-growing contest to decide who will rule the living. The benevolent twin Daebyeol-wang wins, but the malevolent Sobyeol-wang switches the flowers while his brother sleeps. Sobyeol-wang thus becomes the ruler of the living and is responsible for evil on earth. The doubled sun and moon are either destroyed by the twins together, or by Daebyeol-wang alone when his brother comes begging for help in ruling the living. # Samseung-halmang bon-puri: Like Daebyeol-wang and Sobyeol-wang, two deities engage in a flower contest, but in this myth there is no cheating. The goddess who grows the better flowers becomes the goddess of childbirth and young children and establishes the Seocheon flower fields, whose flowers govern life, death, and human emotion. The loser becomes the goddess of dead children who sends disease to infants to kill them. # Manura bon-puri: In a sort of sequel to the Samsung-halmang bon- puri, the childbirth goddess pleads the smallpox god to not harm the children. The latter insults her for being a woman and horribly disfigures the children. The goddess then refuses to allow the smallpox god's wife to give birth, causing her excruciating pain as the child grows inside her. The smallpox god begs for mercy, and the goddess allows his wife to give birth. # Chogong bon- puri: Triplets are born to the scandalous liaison of a nobleman's daughter and a Buddhist priest. The triplets grow to be talented young men who all pass the civil service examinations. Three thousand Confucian scholars, envious of their success, cancel their grades in the examinations and murder or imprison their mother. At the end of a quest, the triplets invent the shamanic rituals and become the first shamans. They use their shamanic powers to resurrect or free their mother, who becomes the ritual mother of all future shamans. After the triplets die, they become judges of the sins of the dead. # Igong bon- puri: The gods appoint a man as the governor of the flower fields of Seocheon. The man's wife is too pregnant for the full journey, and she is left behind in the house of a rich man to give birth to a son named Hallakgung'i. The rich man attempts to seduce the wife. When she refuses, he employs both her and her son as slaves. When Hallakgung'i escapes to Seocheon at the age of fifteen, the man kills his mother in rage. Hallakgung'i uses the flower of evil thought to kill the rich man and his family and the flowers of life to resurrect his mother. Hallakgung'i succeeds his father as the ruler of Seocheon, while his mother takes care of children there. # Samgong bon-puri: Two beggars become fabulously rich soon after their third daughter is born. One day, they ask their daughters who they credit for their fortune. The older two daughters say their parents, but the youngest daughter thanks her own linea nigra. Her parents tell her to leave the house but soon regret it, and tell their older daughters to bring their youngest sister back. The sisters lie and tell her to stay away; they then turn into mushrooms and centipedes. The parents go blind, lose all their wealth, and become beggars again. Meanwhile, the third daughter marries a kind-hearted taro farmer, then discovers that her husband's taro fields are full of gold. The couple becomes rich and holds a feast for beggars. The parents come to the feast, realize that their daughter is there, and miraculously regain their sight. The youngest daughter explains that she is the goddess of jeonsang. # Chasa bon-puri: A woman's three sons all fall dead the day they pass their civil service examinations. The ruler orders a man named Gangnim to capture Yama, the King of Death, so that the woman may know why her sons died. Gangnim journeys into the realm of the dead and meets Yama, who agrees to visit Gangnim's country. Yama reveals that the woman's sons were the reincarnations of three princes that the woman had murdered, who decided to be reborn as her sons and fall dead in order to cause her grief, and makes Gangnim his servant who conducts the spirits of the dead to his realm. # Samani bon-puri (also called Menggam bon-puri): A man named Saman discovers an abandoned skull in the hills and worships it as an ancestor. One day, the skull warns him that he is about to die and gives him advice on how to cheat the gods of death. With the help of the skull, Saman lives for three thousand or forty thousand years. # Segyeong bon-puri: The longest bon-puri. Jacheong-bi is a girl who is born instead of a son due to a Buddhist priest's curse. Over the course of the narrative, she falls in love with a heavenly being named Mun-doryeong, marries him, and resurrects him when he is killed; kills and resurrects her servant Jeongsu-nam; marries a princess of Seocheon while dressed as a man; and suppresses a rebellion in the realm of the gods. Jeongsu-nam, Mun-doryeong, and Jacheong-bi later all become gods of agriculture. # Chilseong bon-puri: When the daughter of a nobleman becomes illicitly pregnant with seven children, her parents imprison her in an iron box and throw her into the sea. The iron box floats to Jeju Island, where seven women and a man open it and find eight snakes inside. They throw the box away, disgusted by the snakes, and are struck with incurable illnesses. The shamans tell them that they have mistreated gods from a foreign land, and the eight hold the first rituals to placate the snake gods. Their illnesses vanish and they become prosperous. The village of Hamdeok begins to worship the snake gods and becomes rich, and eventually all of Jeju comes to venerate them as the goddesses of wealth. # Munjeon bon-puri: An evil woman kills the mother of seven brothers and takes her place in the family. When the children (or only the seventh youngest brother) realize that their mother has been replaced, the woman convinces the father of the family that she, as his wife, is deadly ill and will need to eat the children's (or seventh brother‚Äôs) livers to be cured. The seventh brother thwarts the woman's schemes, dismembers her body, and uses the flowers of Seocheon to resurrect their dead mother. The entire family (including the evil stepmother) becomes the gods of the household, with the seventh brother becoming the god of the gate and his mother the goddess of the kitchen. # Jijang bon-puri: Perhaps the most unusual myth in the genre. When the girl Jijang is four years old, her grandparents die; when she is five, her father dies; when she is six, her mother dies. She is mistreated at her uncle's house until she marries at the age of fifteen into a happy family and gives birth to a son. But at sixteen, her grandparents-in-law die. Her father- in-law, her mother-in-law, her husband, and her son all die in turn, and her husband's family has been exterminated by the time she is nineteen. She holds a large-scale gut for all the people that her presence has killed. Jijang then dies and turns into birds that the shamans must shoo away.  Village-shrine bon-puri  There are over three hundred village shrines in Jeju Island. However, as many as ninety separate shrines can worship the same deity, while many shrines have no associated bon-puri. Only between seventy and eighty village-shrine bon-puri therefore exist. Village-shrine bon-puri have six narrative elements, and are categorized into five types depending on how many of these elements appear. The six elements are given below. # A carnivorous hunting god emerges from a local hill. # A rice-eating agricultural goddess arrives from overseas, often Seoul, China, heaven, the oceans, or a mythical land. Some goddesses appear as snakes. The Chilseong bon-puri was probably originally the bon-puri of the village of Hamdeok, whose worship was adopted throughout the island. # The two gods marry. The goddess often encourages the god to abandon hunting and adopt farming. # The gods divorce, generally due to incompatible eating habits. In the important bon-puri of Songdang shrine, the goddess encourages her husband to plow the earth and divorces him when he devours all the plowing oxen. The bon-puri narrative usually strongly supports the agricultural goddess over the carnivorous husband. # The son of the two gods engages in martial adventures abroad, such as slaying a four-headed barbarian in the service of the Emperor of China, and himself becomes a god of a third village. # The god or gods become the patron of the village. In some bon-puri, the gods shoot arrows and take charge of the place where their arrows land. In others, the god casts curses upon the village until their presence is recognized and they are offered worship, or encourages the villagers to move the settlement to a place that suits the god better. The five types are: # Incipient ( ): Though referred to as bon-puri, these works have no narrative, only a list of place names and theonyms. # Origin-narrating ( ): These bon-puri feature only elements (1) or (2), and the deity is assumed to have been worshipped since the village's founding. # Basic ( ): These bon- puri feature either element (1) or element (2), as well as element (6). # Developing ( ): These bon-puri feature elements (1), (2), (3), and (6). The myth of the Samseonghyeol is a typical example of the type. # Complete ( ): These bon-puri feature all six elements, and are reserved for the largest and most sacred shrines. Many village-shrine bon-puri posit their gods to be kin of other gods. Songdang shrine, whose two gods have a dedicated complete bon- puri, is crucial to this network because the Songdang gods are thought to have had eighteen sons, twenty-eight daughters, and 378 grandchildren, all of whom became patrons of various villages. In one extremely unusual village-shrine bon-puri, the patrons of the village are believed to be Daebyeol-wang and Sobyeol-wang, the twin protagonists of the Cheonji-wang bon-puri. This does not fit into any of the categories above.  Ancestral bon-puri  The ancestral bon-puri are dedicated to the patron gods of families and occupations, who are often not actually perceived as ancestors. For example, the bon-puri of the god Yeongdeung, associated with fishing, is performed only by shamans whose families are fishermen. The identity of the deity that is worshipped varies. Some families worship historical ancestors, while others worship snakes, dokkaebi, crones, or young girls. Because they are traditionally known only by shamans from within the family, they are not well- understood by outsiders.  Special bon-puri  There are five special bon- puri. * Woncheon'gang bon-puri: Two unrelated narratives share this name. The Woncheon'gang is a divination book traditionally used in Jeju. ** One version is about an orphaned girl named Onal () who embarks on a long journey to the land of Woncheon'gang to find her parents. After her return, she makes people copy down the Woncheon'gang. ** Another version is about a woman who is tricked into betraying her husband. As her husband leaves, he makes her read the Woncheon'gang. * Semin-hwangje bon-puri: Emperor Taizong of Tang dies and finds that his account in the realm of the dead is in great debt due to his many sins. He repays his debt by borrowing from the accounts of an impoverished couple who have done only good in their lives, and who are still alive. After escaping back to the living world, the emperor finds the couple and repays with interest the money he had borrowed from them in the realm of the dead. * Heogung-aegi bon-puri: The realm of the living and dead were once connected, and the dead could return to the living world every night. A young mother named Heogung-aegi dies but visits her family every night to take care of her young children. One day, she fails to return. In one version, she is imprisoned by a giantess; in another version, she is hidden by her family. Gangnim, who is sent to retrieve her, severs Heogung-aegi's soul from her body and leaves the corpse behind. From then on, the dead leave their bodies behind, and the physical connection between the living and dead worlds is severed to prevent similar cases. * Samdu-gumi bon-puri: An old matchmaker promises a young woman that he will find a good husband for her, then tells her to eat one of his (or another human's) legs. When she refuses, he kills her. The woman's younger sister is similarly killed for refusing to eat the old man's leg. The youngest sister agrees to eat his leg, and the man tells her that he loves people who will eat human legs and hates unboiled eggs, willow branches, and iron, because they will defeat his magic. The matchmaker later takes his true form as a three-headed, nine-tailed monster, but the girl uses eggs, willow branches, and iron to kill him. She buries her murdered sisters and grinds the monster's body to powder so it will not return.

Since 1959 he worked as a senior editor in the feuilleton of the S√ºddeutsche Zeitung; from 1977 to 1996 he was professor for history of music at the State University of Music and Performing Arts Stuttgart.  Life  Borrn in Mi≈Çki, , Kaiser was born in 1928 as the son of a country doctor. At the age of eight he began to play the piano. Playing music together with his family was one of the happiest moments in his life. Literature and music began to interest him at an early age. After the flight and expulsion of Germans from Central and Eastern Europe 1945-1950, he attended the Wilhelm-Gymnasium (Hamburg). He then studied musicology, German studies, philosophy and sociology at the Georg-August-Universit√§t G√∂ttingen, the Johann Wolfgang Goethe-Universit√§t Frankfurt am Main and the Eberhard Karls Universit√§t T√ºbingen. Among his fellow students were the musicologists Carl Dahlhaus and Rudolf Stephan. In June 1951 Kaiser began his journalistic career as a theatre, literature and music critic. His path was paved by a review of a publication by Theodor W. Adorno: Music and Catastrophe. About the \\"Philosophy of New Music\\". Adorno recommended Kaiser Alfred Andersch of the Hessischer Rundfunk, which in turn drew the attention of the Frankfurter Hefte. Mathias D√∂pfner described him as \\"the best known and most successful Adorno students ever\\". At the invitation of Hans Werner Richter, Kaiser was allowed to take part in events of Group 47 from 1953. In 1958 he was awarded a doctorate in German Studies at the University of T√ºbingen on the subject of Franz Grillparzer's dramatic style. On the initiative of the then SZ journalist Erich Kuby, Kaiser was able to work in the cultural editorial department of the S√ºddeutsche Zeitung from 1959. He was a member of the writers' association PEN-Zentrum Deutschland. Kaiser, along with Marcel Reich- Ranicki, was one of the most influential critics of Germany. His book Gro√üe Pianisten in unserer ZeitGro√üe Pianisten in unserer Zeit on WorldCat is occasionally referred to as the \\"Piano Michelin\\". Besides groundbreaking pianists such as Artur Rubinstein, Vladimir Horowitz, Glenn Gould, Sviatoslav Richter and Friedrich Gulda he introduced young interpreters and explained developments in the art of piano playing. Joachim Kaiser about Arthur Rubinstein: \\"Wonderful, astonishing, incomprehensible, but it is not only the technical clarity of his playing, the touching, in slow movements heart-moving lucidity of his phrasing, the stormy temperament of his outbursts. All of this weighs a lot, wants to conquer, preserve and be kept alive...\\" In Gro√üe Pianisten in unserer Zeit. 5th edition, 1996, . Kaiser felt a special connection to the work of Richard Wagner and supported and accompanied the new beginning of the Bayreuth Festival in 1951 under the direction of Wagner's grandchildren, Wieland and Wolfgang. Kaiser was married to the translator and novelist Susanne Kaiser since December 1958,Autoren ‚Äì Susanne Kaiser.

He graduated from Princeton University and University of Pennsylvania law school. While studying in Princeton, he majored in philosophy. Later, he participated in the air corps in world war II, but was discharged for medical reasons in 1944. Career Kirkpatrick became a partner in the Philadelphia law firm Morgan, Lewis & Brockius in 1955 and gained prominence as an antitrust specialist. He headed the antitrust section of America's bar association from 1968 to 1969. In 1969, at the request of president Richard Nixon, he led a bar association commission to look into the FTC. The commission concluded that many high-level employees were do-nothings and incompetent, while FTC was pursuing interest in trivial matters. Nixon was impressed by Kirkpatrick and appointed Caspar Weinberger as the chairman of FTC. In 1970, Nixon appointed Miles as the chairman of FTC, while his predecessor Kirkpatrick was appointed the head of office management and budget. Under Kirkpatrick, the commission prodded manufacturers to back up their claims of advertised safety, performance and therapeutic value. It told Coca-Cola to stop contending that one of their drinks was abundant in vitamin C. The commission also instructed the anti-freeze Zerex to warn that it could damage automative cooling systems. He resigned early in 1973 to pursue a legal career. It was presumed that Nixon nudged him out of office, although his son confirmed that it was voluntary, as Kirkpatrick thought \\"he had accomplished all he could.\\" Kirkpatrick retired from his law firm in 1985.

Garraway is an American Neuroscientist and Assistant Professor of Physiology in the Department of Physiology at Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta, Georgia. Garraway is the Director of the Emory Multiplex Immunoassay Core (EMIC) where she assists researchers from both academia and industry to perform, analyze, and interpret their multiplexed immunoassays. Garraway studies the neural mechanisms of spinal nociceptive pain after spinal cord injury and as a postdoctoral researcher she discovered roles for both BDNF and ERK2 in pain sensitization and developed novel siRNA technology to inhibit ERK2 as a treatment for pain.  Early life and education  Garraway pursued her Bachelors of Arts at the University of Guelph, in Guelph, Ontario, Canada. She graduated in 1993 and moved to Mantioba where she pursued her graduate studies at the University of Manitoba, in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. She studied under the mentorship of Shawn Hochman in the Department of Physiology exploring synaptic plasticity in deep dorsal horn (DDH) neurons since they play a fundamental role in nociception and relaying pain information to the brain. Garraway published four first-author papers during her PhD.  Mechanisms of plasticity in deep dorsal horn neurons  Garraway explored how primary afferent stimulation impacted plasticity, in the form of long term potentiation (LTP) or long term depression (LTD), of the DDH neurons. LTP and LTD had only just been identified in the spinal cord, and Garraway discovered that LTP and LTD can also be induced in the DDH neurons with even lower frequency afferent stimulation. She also found that in rats aged P9-16, only LTP could be produced. These findings shed light on potential mechanisms of prolonged pain sensation, or chronic pain, as LTD and LTP present forms of long lasting cellular memory. Garraway then explored the descending serotonergic projections that modulate the DDH neurons. She used an in vitro slice preparation of DDH neurons and applied various serotonin receptor ligands to assess the effects of modulation at each serotonin receptor subtype in the primary afferent neurons. She found that the afferents are in fact modulated by several serotonin receptors and that 5-HT1A modulation facilitates evoked responses whereas 5-HT7 depressed evoked responses. Her work was one of the first identifications of the presence and effects of 5-HT7 receptors in the spinal cord and her results showed promise in using selective serotonin receptor targeting in the modulation of pain. Garraway then further characterized monoamine transmitter effects in the spinal cord in comparison with the actions of acetylcholine. She found dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine depressed postsynaptic potentials and did not modify the passive membrane properties of neurons whereas acetylcholine lead to increased EPSP amplitude. Further, Garraway found that the addition of both serotonin and norepinephrine simultaneously could evoke even greater depression than either in isolation.  BDNF and sensitization  After completing her graduate studies in 2000, Garraway moved to the United States to pursue her postdoctoral training at the State University of New York at Stony Brook. She studied under Lorne Mendell exploring how brain derived neurotrophic factor signalling modulated neural transmission in nociceptive pathways in the spinal cord. Garraway explored the, at the time, unknown implications of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) on central sensitization and exaggerated pain states. Garraway found that BDNF signalling in the dorsal horn led to facilitation, and the initiation of this facilitation was dependent on NMDA recpetor signalling and phospholipase C. Garraway then explored how spinal injury impacted the effects of BDNF on lamina II neurons. She found that after neonatal spinal injury, BDNF was no longer able to facilitate dorsal-root EPSCs. After discovering that NMDA receptor dysfunction was not the cause for decreased responses, she elucidated that expression of dysfunctional trkB might be contributing to the decline in BDNF effects after injury. Garraway then completed a second postdoctoral fellowship in New York City, at the Weill Cornell Medical College. She worked in the Department of Pharmacology and became an instructor of Pharmacology as well. Garraway studied under the mentorship of Charles Inturrisi, exploring methods of chronic pain management and biological mechanisms of pain with which to target. She first designed and tested a novel small interfering RNA that knocked down expression of the NR1 subunit of the NMDA receptor. This led to decreased mechanical allodynia after injection of an inflammatory agent. She then tested the efficacy of the siRNA on formalin-induced phase 2 nociceptive responses, and it was able to significantly reduce them. Both of her results show that vector-derived siRNAs targeting the NR1 subunit of the AMPA receptor might be beneficial in the treatment of pain by reducing expression of genes mediating pain sensation in the spinal cord.  Career and research  In 2008, Garraway moved to Texas A & M University where she became a Research Assistant Professor and worked with James W. Grau exploring the neurobiological underpinnings of learned pain in the spinal cord. In 2014, Garraway was recruited to Emory University where she was appointed to Assistant Professor of Physiology at the School of Medicine. Garraway is also a Faculty Member for the Neuroscience Graduate Program at Emory. In 2019, she was promoted to Scientific Director of the Emory Multiplex Immunoassay Core, where she now guides researchers in both academia and industry in the use of facility equipment and analysis and interpretation of the results of multiplexed immunoassays. In addition to her role as Scientific Core Director, Garraway is also the Principal Investigator of the Garraway Lab which explores the mechanisms underlying the development of chronic pain after spinal cord injury. Her lab uses peripheral and spinal cord injury models to explore cellular mechanisms of neuropathic pain, how autonomic dysfunction is related to sensitization, and how peripheral and central pain networks interact to lead to chronic pain. The Garraway Lab is funded by the Craig Neilsen Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, the Department of Defense, and the TIRR Foundation. Garraway is also a member of various national and international groups working to study pain and find cures and treatments for pain disorders. Garraway is a member of the International Pain Research Forum and is also a member of The Institute for Rehabilitation and Research (TIRR) Foundation a collaborative research foundation that innovates therapies for people with sustained nervous system damage. Garraway is also on the editorial board for the JSciMed - Brain Science journal which publishes open access, peer-reviewed articles in neuroscience.  Role of BDNF in pain sensitization  After discovering a role for spinal cord BDNF signaling in pain sensitization in her postdoc, Garraway explored whether the behavioral correlates of pain were associated with cellular changes mediated by BDNF. She found that nociceptive stimulation decreased expression of BDNF, TrkB, and ERK2 in the dorsal spinal cord. Garraway and her colleagues then found that BDNF signalling mediates the protective and restorative effects of instrumental training in models where pain is controllable. After instrumental training, where rats learned to not flex their hind limb to prevent pain, there were increases in BDNF and increased plasticity. Further, when BDNF was injected during uncontrollable pain stimulation, it blocked allodynia and enabled rats to learn to not extend their hind legs. Overall, her results and work point to the importance of BDNF in beneficial plasticity in pain models and the potential importance of BDNF in plasticity and recovery after spinal cord injury.  Role of TNF alpha in chronic pain  Garraway also explores the role of Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNFa) signalling in the development and maintenance of chronic pain. In 2015, she discovered increases in TNFa expression after nociceptive stimulation post spinal cord injury and that downstream TNFa signalling may induce apoptosis in neurons and microglia. In 2019, Garraway and her colleagues found that peripheral inflammation increases the onset of mechanical hypersensitivity after spinal cord injury and that TNFa is involved in the early onset sensitization process.

Ogden was educated in Leeds, partly under Joseph Hutton, minister of Mill Hill Unitarian Chapel; he became a unitarian, though his parents were members of the Church of England. For a short time he was placed in the office of Thomas Bolton in Liverpool, but had no taste for mercantile life, and showed an early bent for music. To forward his musical education, his mother (whose maiden name was Glover) moved to London. Here Ogden became a pupil of Ignaz Moscheles, and later of August Kollman. He studied for a year in Paris under Johann Peter Pixis, and for three years in Munich under ; in 1827 he visited Vienna. He married in 1834 Frances, daughter of Thomas Bolton. Afterwards he settled in the Lake District, at Lakefield, Sawrey, Lancashire, where he lived the life of a country gentleman. The religious philosopher James Martineau, when compiling Hymns for the Christian Church and Home (1840), invited Ogden to supply tunes of unusual metre. Ogden, after much persuasion, assented. The result was Holy Songs and Musical Prayers, published by Novello in 1842. A feature of the volume which evoked criticism was the adaptation as hymn tunes of pieces by Beethoven and others. From the seventh and much enlarged edition (1872) the adaptations were omitted. Alexander Gordon later wrote: \\"The style of Ogden's original music is not ecclesiastical, nor are his compositions well adapted for ordinary congregational use; but they possess great beauty, and their spirit is rightly indicated in the title of the volume.\\" Ogden was a J.P. for Lancashire.

Born in Suvalkija to a family of Lithuanian farmers, Ma≈°iotas attended Marijampolƒó Gymnasium and studied mathematics at Moscow University. As a Catholic, he could not obtain employment in Lithuania and took temporary clerical jobs in ≈Åom≈ºa and Riga before becoming math teacher at the Riga Gymnasium in 1891. He held this job until World War I forced him to evacuate to Voronezh where he became director of the Lithuanian girls' and boys' gymnasiums. He returned to Lithuania in 1918 and started working on organizing the education system in the newly independent country. He was vice-minister at the Ministry of Education from 1919 to 1923. He then became director of the . He retired in 1929 and focused on literary work. He died on 14 September 1940. Ma≈°iotas was very active in Lithuanian cultural life. He joined and organized various Lithuanian societies, including the Lithuanian Scientific Society and the ≈Ωvaig≈ædƒó Society which he chaired for about a decade. He contributed about 600 articles to the Lithuanian press. In total, he published about 140 books of which about 30 are original (others are translations or based on works by others). He mainly published children's fiction, textbooks for schools, and popular science books. He translated such children's classics as Maya the Bee by Waldemar Bonsels and Emil and the Detectives by Erich K√§stner. Biography=Early life Ma≈°iotas was born on 19 December 1863 in near Kudirkos Naumiestis which was then part of the Russian Empire. His parents were farmers. Their home was located near the border with East Prussia and as such sometimes sheltered Lithuanian book smugglers who carried illegal Lithuanian publications to the Russian Empire in violation of the Lithuanian press ban. He attended a Russian primary school for about half a year, but was mostly home schooled by his parents and relatives. In 1874, he was admitted to the preparatory class of the Marijampolƒó Gymnasium. His classmates were future writers Antanas Krik≈°ƒçiukaitis (pen name Ai≈°bƒó) and (pen name Keturakis). He graduated in 1883 with a silver medal. He received a special government stipend for Lithuanian students (360 rubles annually) and enrolled into the Faculty of Physics and Mathematics at Moscow University. There, he joined Lithuanian cultural life and became a contributor to Au≈°ra, the first Lithuanian-language newspaper. In total, he published ten articles in Au≈°ra in which he criticized the Lithuanian press ban and other Russification policies implement by the Tsarist regime and provided practical advice to Lithuanian farmers. Teacher in Riga He returned to Lithuania in 1887, but as a Lithuanian Catholic could not obtain a job due to the Russification policies. He got a clerical job in ≈Åom≈ºa in Poland and in 1889 moved to Riga in Latvia. Initially, he was a clerk at the office of the . In 1891, he became math teacher at the Riga Gymnasium and held this job for almost 25 years until World War I. In 1913‚Äì1915, he was also the director of a private girls' gymnasium in Riga. In Riga, Ma≈°iotas was active in Lithuanian cultural life. Riga's industrialization provided employment opportunities that attracted increasing numbers of Lithuanians. In 1913, there were more than 35,000 Lithuanians in Riga. Together with others, he participated in and organized various Lithuanian societies, including the Lithuanian Benefit Society () which organized cultural events to provide assistance to struggling Lithuanians in Riga, Kanklƒós Society which organized amateur theater performances (established in 1904), and ≈Ωvaig≈ædƒó Society (established in 1906) which established six Lithuanian primary schools and organized evening courses for adults. Ma≈°iotas chaired the ≈Ωvaig≈ædƒó Society for about a decade. He frequently collaborated with , another Lithuanian math teacher at the Riga Gymnasium. Ma≈°iotas also participated in cultural and political life in Lithuania. In 1902, he participated in the founding meeting of the Lithuanian Democratic Party and was elected to its central committee. During the Russian Revolution of 1905, he attended the Great Seimas of Vilnius. In 1905, Ma≈°iotas became a member of the 20-member committee tasked with organizing the Lithuanian Scientific Society which was officially established in April 1907. He contributed his ethnographic photographs to the society. Some of his photos were added to the Lithuanian exhibition at the International Paris Exposition in 1900. Ma≈°iotas contributed some 70 articles to illegal Lithuanian periodicals (pre-1904) and about 200 articles to the legalized press, including ≈†viesa, Vienybƒó lietuvinink≈≥, Vilniaus ≈æinios, Viltis, Vairas, Rygos garsas. His articles most often discussed education, Lithuanian language, economy, social issues. Due to his efforts, ' which was published in Saint Petersburg in 1904‚Äì1906 established a section for children in which Ma≈°iotas published his works and translations. He particularly supported Varpas and participated in the meetings of its publishers and supporters. Independent Lithuania Ma≈°iotas with his wife Marija and son Donatas around 1930 At the outbreak of World War I, Ma≈°iotas together with Juozas Tumas-Vai≈ægantas became representatives of the Lithuanian Society for the Relief of War Sufferers in Riga. In summer 1915, as German Army approached Riga, Ma≈°iotas evacuated to Moscow and then Voronezh where he became director of the Lithuanian girls' and boys' gymnasiums established by Martynas Yƒças. At the same time, Ma≈°iotas worked on writing math textbooks. Since there was no established or consistent Lithuanian mathematical terminology, three mathematicians (Ma≈°iotas, , ) and linguist Jonas Jablonskis worked on standardizing the terminology and compiling a Lithuanian math dictionary. Ma≈°iotas also participated in Lithuanian political life in Russia. After the failure of the Petrograd Seimas, the Union of Lithuanian Soldiers asked three men ‚Äì Ma≈°iotas, Jablonskis, and Kazys Grinius ‚Äì to organize the Supreme Lithuanian Council in Russia, a political committee that could represent the Lithuanian nation. Ma≈°iotas became vice-chairman of the Supreme Lithuanian Council. He returned to Lithuania in 1918 and started working organizing the Lithuanian education system. He joined the education section of the Council of Lithuania and later worked at the Ministry of Education as director of the Higher Education Department and as vice-minister. At the same time, he published numerous articles discussing plans for organizing various schools in Lithuania. Due to political disagreements, the post of vice-minister was abolished in 1923 and Ma≈°iotas was given the job as the director of the . Klaipƒóda Region was incorporated as an autonomous region of Lithuania after the Klaipƒóda Revolt in January 1923. Ma≈°iotas retired in 1929 and devoted his time to writing. There are two versions of his retirement ‚Äì due to disagreements with Klaipƒóda governor Antanas Merkys or due to health reasons (cheek neuralgia that would get so bad that he could not speak). His wife Marija typed up his handwritten works while his son Donatas helped to arrange their publication. His articles were published in Iliustruota Lietuva, Lietuva, Lietuvos aidas, Lietuvos ≈´kininkas, Lietuvos ≈æinios, M≈´s≈≥ senovƒó, Naujoji romuva, Trimitas, etc. Ma≈°iotas was awarded the Order of the Lithuanian Grand Duke Gediminas in 1928 (2nd class) and 1933 (1st class). He received honorary doctorate from the University of Lithuania in 1923 and was elected as honorary member of the . One of the streets in Kaunas was named after him in 1934. Architect Vytautas ≈Ωemkalnis-Landsbergis, one of Ma≈°iotas' students in Riga who Ma≈°iotas encouraged to study architecture, designed his private residence in the ≈Ωaliakalnis district of Kaunas where Ma≈°iotas lived from 1929. After the Soviet occupation of Lithuania in June 1940, Ma≈°iotas house in Kaunas was confiscated by the NKVD. He moved in with his son in Kaƒçerginƒó. His daughter bibliographer and her husband Juozas Urb≈°ys were arrested and deported to Siberia by the Soviets. On 14 September 1940, he died at the age of 77. His wake was held at the Vytautas the Great War Museum; his funeral was a large public event attended by numerous government officials and writers. Speeches were given by Antanas Venclova and Petras Cvirka, among others. He was buried at the Kaunas City Cemetery. When the cemetery was converted to in 1959, he was reburied at the Petra≈°i≈´nai Cemetery. Works Ma≈°iotas wrote and published numerous books for children, textbooks for schools, and popular science books. In total, he published about 140 books of which about 30 are original. He also contributed some 600 articles to various Lithuanian periodicals. Because the Lithuania press was illegal before 1904, he used some 50 different pen names and initialisms. Ma≈°iotas is best known as a children's author. He is sometimes referred to as the \\"father of the Lithuanian children's literature\\". Prior publications for children were religious or clearly didactic texts. In 1894, Ma≈°iotas published an article in Varpas in which he outlined the basic requirements for children's texts ‚Äì works should have aesthetic, educational, and moral value as well as be written in correct language. These principles were largely adopted by future authors. His later works and translations focused on educational value (e.g. teaching children about natural phenomena) as opposed to rousing child's creativity or imagination. His tales were published in several collections ‚Äì My Little Gift (, 1st edition in 1913, 5th edition in 1970) and Old Man's Tales (, 1st edition in 1917, 4th edition in 1970) are most popular. While the tales promote moral values, they are written without direct moralization. Several of his books ‚Äì I Too Was Little (, 1st edition in 1919, 6th edition in 1969), Remembering Gymnasium (, 1st edition in 1922), When Books Were Banned (, first edition in 1924, 4th edition in 1993) ‚Äì are autobiographical stories about the Lithuanian National Revival and the Lithuanian press ban. In 1938, I Too Was Little was awarded the literary prize of the Lithuanian Red Cross. His short stories feature realistic characters and are most often based on rational thought and not emotion. His travel books idealize Lithuania's nature but also include geographical, historical, ethnographic information. They were aimed at school students in hopes of spurring their interest in their native country and encouraging them to launch their own local studies. Ma≈°iotas translated various authors, including Daniel Defoe, James Oliver Curwood, Erich K√§stner, Hugh Lofting, Karin Micha√´lis, Ferenc Moln√°r, Ernest Thompson Seton, H. G. Wells, Ernst Wichert, and many others. Ma≈°iotas started translating when he taught Lithuanian language on weekends in Riga. As homework, he would assign students to translate Russian or German works and then became interested in this work himself. He translated freely, modifying or shortening texts as he saw fit to adapt them to the Lithuanian audience. Encouraged by Jonas Jablonskis, Ma≈°iotas wrote his first math textbook in summer 1905. It was a problem book in arithmetic that was published in two parts in 1906. It became very popular and was republished 14 times (last edition in 1938). In 1919‚Äì1921, he published other textbooks on plane trigonometry, history of math, algebra, logarithm. He also wrote a textbook on physics (1922) and two textbooks on learning to write (1907 and 1921). The textbook on plane trigonometry was reworked and republished by his son in 1938. The textbooks were prepared in a hurry to fill the urgent need of Lithuanian-language textbooks. Therefore, their quality suffered. Ma≈°iotas also published several popular science books for children, including Conversations about Sky and Earth ( in 1901), How People Took Over the World ( in 1919). His Science Tales () were first published in 1916 and republished three more times. It includes eight stories how a teacher instructs shepherds about laws of physics using everyday language and small experiments ‚Äì i.e. lively dialogues and some semblance of a plot turned textbook lectures into lively easy to understand stories. Legacy Fairy Tale Park dedicated to Ma≈°iotas in Kaƒçerginƒó Starting in 1969, Ma≈°iotas' works and translations are republished in the series Little Library of Pranas Ma≈°iotas (). On average, in 1969‚Äì1979, about 25,000 copies of each book was published. By 1983, the series had 37 books. It grew to 50 books by 2009. His daughter Marija published her memoirs about Ma≈°iotas in 1982 (second edition in 1996). Albinas Degutis compiled and published Ma≈°iotas' bibliography (1990) and a collection of his articles, letters, and memoirs about him (2013). In 2013, on the occasion of his 150th birth anniversary, Lietuvos pa≈°tas issued a commemorative postal stamp in his memory. Three schools ‚Äì in Kaunas, Vilnius, and Klaipƒóda ‚Äì and several streets in Lithuania are named in his honor. A memorial stone was erected at the birthplace of Ma≈°iotas in 1990. In 2001, Ma≈°iotas' granddaughter gifted the house in Kaƒçerginƒó to the town on a condition that it would house a museum dedicated to the Ma≈°iotas family. In 2004, several wood carvers created sculptures for the Fairy Tale Park inspired by Ma≈°iotas that was established around the house. In 1983, the 120th birth anniversary of Ma≈°iotas, Vilnius University organized an academic seminar on children's literature in Lithuania. Several similar seminars took place irregularly until an annual seminar named after Ma≈°iotas was established in 1993. It is held in December by the Lithuanian section of the International Board on Books for Young People (IBBY) and the Martynas Ma≈ævydas National Library of Lithuania. In 2012, IBBY renamed its annual (since 1993) award for the best Lithuanian book for children and adolescents in honor of Ma≈°iotas.

During his career in Edinburgh he became an early user of local anaesthetic techniques in general surgery and wrote a highly regarded booklet on the topic. He was elected President of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh (RCSEd) from 1941 to 1943.  Early life  Struthers was born in 1874 in Oldmachar, Aberdeen. He was the son of the son of Sir John Struthers, Regius Professor of Anatomy at the University of Aberdeen and a former President of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh (RCSEd). His mother Christina (n√©e Alexander) was the daughter of James Alexander (1795‚Äì1863), a surgeon in Wooler, England. He was educated at Loretto School in Musselburgh. He remained close to the school throughout his life, serving as a governor for several years. He studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh Medical School, qualifying MB ChB in 1897.  Surgical career  He was appointed house physician in the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh (RIE) to Dr Byrom Bramwell and house surgeon at Leith Hospital to Mr Alexander Miles. He went on to act as anatomy demonstrator for four years under Sir William Turner and Prof. D.J. Cunningham before qualifying as a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh in 1899. After appointment as clinical tutor in the RIE in 1908 he became assistant surgeon to the hospital. During World War I he served initially with the Red Cross at Rouen, France. and was then posted as a major in the Royal Army Medical Corps (RAMC) to the 42nd General Hospital at Salonica where he was in charge of the surgical division of the hospital. Here he served alongside C M Grieve, later known as the poet Hugh MacDiarmid, who was Sergeant-Caterer of the RAMC Officer‚Äôs Mess. For his service to Serbian troops in this campaign Struthers was awarded the Order of St Sava by the Serbian government. After the war he returned to Edinburgh and resumed duties in the RIE being promoted to full surgeon in 1924. From 1925 he was consulting surgeon at Leith Hospital. His specialist interests included the use of local anaesthesia in general surgery and he published a monograph on the subject in 1906. Notes on local anaesthesia in general surgery was described in the Lancet as \\"...for long the best source of information on the subject in English.\\" Struthers noted that much of the research on the subject had taken place in the US, France and Germany and that its introduction into clinical practice into. Britain had been relatively slow. Struthers described techniques of infiltration, regional and spinal anaesthesia and how these could be used for major surgical procedures. Wildsmith suggested that it was Struthers' work that led to the development of spinal hypotensive anaesthesia by Gillies and Griffiths. With the pathologist James Walker Dawson, Struthers conducted original work on osteitis fibrosa cystica. Their work was considered of such importance that an entire issue of the Edinburgh Medical Journal in 1923 was devoted to the subject. In this they related the condition to a parathyroid adenoma. Struthers later undertook with Dr H. E. Seiler, the Edinburgh Medical Officer of Health, an extensive survey of the hospital accommodation in southeast Scotland, on behalf of the Department of Health, in preparation for the National Health Service. Throughout his working life he was associated with the RCSEd serving as secretary and treasurer from 1927 to 1941. He was elected President of the RCSEd in 1941.  Awards and honours  In recognition of his service to the University of Edinburgh he was made a Member of the Faculty and later of the Senatus. The university conferred the honorary degree of LL.D. in 1946.  Family  Struthers came from a family with strong medical connections. His father Sir John Struthers, was Regius Professor of Anatomy at the University of Aberdeen. Two of his uncles were doctors, Alexander Struthers who died at Scutari Hospital in Istanbul during the Crimea campaign and James Struthers (1821‚Äì1891), a physician who also worked at Leith Hospital. He married Anna Leyde in Edinburgh in 1901. Struthers died at his home in Gullane, Scotland in 1953.  Selected publications  Notes on local anaesthesia in general surgery. (1906) Edinburgh: Wm.

Life On her father's side, Caroline Auguste Venturini's family was probably of Italian origin. Her father Karl Venturini (1735-1801) was a chamber musician at the ducal court in Braunschweig and her mother Charlotty, whose maiden name was K√∂chy, was the daughter of a tailor. Her brother Karl Heinrich Georg Venturini was a famous early-19th century theologist and writer. Her other three siblings died young.Christine Touaillon: Der deutsche Frauenroman des 18. Jahrhunderts. Braum√ºller, Vienna and Leipzig 1919, S. 578. In her first marriage, she was married to the Pastor Cristoph Johann Rudolph Christiani (1761-1841), at the latest from the year 1791. From 1793, Christiani was the German high priest in Copenhagen and ran a boys' school there, at which her brother Karl taught for several years. The jurist and politician Rudolf Christiani (1797-1858) was their son. A daughter of theirs, who was born as early as 1792, died at the age of three in 1795. During her time in Copenhagen, she rubbed shoulders with Danish and German artists. Among others, she was friendly with the writer Jens Immanuel Baggesen.Elke Spitzer: Emanzipationsanspr√ºche zwischen der Querelle des Femmes und der modernen Frauenbewegung: der Wandel des Gleichheitsbegriffs am Ausgang des 18. Jahrhunderts. S. 125. In the year 1801, she was deemed the guilty party in her divorce from Christiani and therefore had to leave her son in her father's custody. Caroline Auguste Christiani, who was also called Caroline Auguste Ferdinande Christiani, thereupon went to Dresden. In the same year, she began to write and thereby soon became famous. At this time, she was already living together with the businessman and writer Christian August Fischer, who had been a professor in W√ºrzburg since 1804 and with whom she had a son, Albert, in 1803. They lived separately, but ended up marrying in 1808 after all, probably so that their son would be considered legitimate. They divorced again after just 7 months of marriage in 1809. He himself admitted to having been put off by her advanced age and overwhelmed by her fame.Christine Touaillon: Der deutsche Frauenroman des 18. Jahrhunderts. Braum√ºller, Vienna and Leipzig 1919, S. 582. Even though Christian Fischer had to pay alimony as the guilty party in the divorce, Caroline Auguste Fischer got into financial difficulty. Having published her first novels as early as 1801, she worked as a writer and, in 1816; her divorced husband was dismissed from the university and subsequently discontinued the alimony payments, meaning that she would have less and less time to dedicate to her writing. Up until 1820, she was still writing stories and newspaper articles, after which year she made a living as the principal of a reform school in Heidelberg and as a library book dealer in Frankfurt. In her later years, she suffered from melancholy, which is why she was admitted to a care home for several weeks in 1832. She subsequently moved to Frankfurt to live with her son. After Albert's death two years later, nothing more is known about her. Completely impoverished, she died in the Frankfurt Hospice of the Holy Spirit in 1842.Elke Spitzer: Emanzipationsanspr√ºche zwischen der Querelle des Femmes und der modernen Frauenbewegung: der Wandel des Gleichheitsbegriffs am Ausgang des 18. Jahrhunderts. S. 128. Work After her divorce, Caroline Auguste Christiani began to write. In her work, which was probably also influenced by her own life, she depicted the tension between the genders, juxtaposing traditional female role models with new, alternative ways for women to live their lives, which mostly completely contradicted the idealistic view of the woman in the early 19th century. In line with her call for equality, which only existed for men in the French Revolution, she called for women's right to an independent way of life, which could also absolutely still be traditional marriage. Her debut novel Gustav's Aberrations was published anonymously. She narrated the story from the perspective of the male protagonist, detailing his feelings towards different women in his life. He repeatedly idealises them and is then repulsed when he discovers a real, independent person instead of his ideal. Gustav ashamedly recognises the societal gap between the genders. Chastened and suffering from a sexually transmitted disease he returns to his first true love. However, he then wants to get divorced because the ideal of their marriage cannot be fulfilled: they do not have any children and, as a consequence, he believes he will make his wife unhappy. Like the previous wives, the wife and her wishes are not part of his imagination. The book ends with Gustav's premature death and his widow's second marriage, which produces many children.Carola Hilmes: Namenlos. √úber die Verfasserin von ‚ÄûGustavs Verirrungen‚Äú, S. 8‚Äì12 (PDF; 133 kB) Her epistolary novel The Honeymonths, which was written not long after her divorce, is a response to Wilhelmine Karoline von Wobeser's publication Elisa, or the wife as she should be, which was a bestseller at its time, and in which von Wobeser creates the ideal image of the selfless woman. In 1800, Caroline Auguste's partner Fischer had written an appendix for the fifth edition in which he outlined man's right to supremacy and demanded subservience from women.Elke Spitzer: Emanzipationsanspr√ºche zwischen der Querelle des Femmes und der modernen Frauenbewegung: der Wandel des Gleichheitsbegriffs am Ausgang des 18. Jahrhunderts. S. 126. Caroline Auguste Christiani's The Honeymonths was released anonymously.Carola Hilmes: Namenlos. √úber die Verfasserin von ‚ÄûGustavs Verirrungen‚Äú, S. 5 (PDF; 133 kB) The female protagonist, the virtuous and gentle Julie, is, like in Elisa, trapped in an unhappy marriage of convenience and actually willingly sacrifices herself for her selfish husband, who is described as unlikeable, instead of choosing to love another man. In contrast, her friend Wilhelmine repudiates the contemporary image of women, refuses an arranged marriage and instead demands a temporary marriage and women's right to keep their children after a divorce.Katharina Herrmann: Caroline Auguste Fischer (1764‚Äì1842) und die Idee einer Ehe auf Zeit She urges Julie to take a stand and warns her not to become like Elisa.Cited in Elke Spitzer: Emanzipationsanspr√ºche zwischen der Querelle des Femmes und der modernen Frauenbewegung: der Wandel des Gleichheitsbegriffs am Ausgang des 18. Jahrhunderts. S. 131. Julie ends up remaining a widow, whereas Wilhelmine finds her love. In The Prot√©g√© Fischer addresses the question of how women deal with power and how men deal with powerful women. The protagonist, the ruler Iwanova, resembles Catherine the Great. She is pitted against young Maria, the embodiment of the ideal woman in Rousseau's sense. Both women are connected to Prince Alexander from whose perspective the story unfolds. The prince rejects the ruler's love for two reasons: at first, he deems his career more important and later on he recognises the selfless love of Maria. Iwanova allows their marriage, but she murders the couple during their wedding night.Elke Spitzer: Emanzipationsanspr√ºche zwischen der Querelle des Femmes und der modernen Frauenbewegung: der Wandel des Gleichheitsbegriffs am Ausgang des 18. Jahrhunderts. S. 145f. Nevertheless, Iwanova is depicted positively, while Alexander is the one who does not get along with a strong woman. In the novel Margaret, two women opt against marriage. Rosamunde, who is a dancer, would prefer to dedicate her time for art and Margaret decides against the love of a prince and the upward mobility that would have come with the relationship. Instead, she dedicates herself to social work..Elke Spitzer: Emanzipationsanspr√ºche zwischen der Querelle des Femmes und der modernen Frauenbewegung: der Wandel des Gleichheitsbegriffs am Ausgang des 18. Jahrhunderts. S. 152f. In her short story William the Negro, published in 1817, the protagonist is a black man. William, a freed slave living under the protection of Sir Robert, a rich Englishman, falls in love with Molly who is the daughter of an impoverished businessman. However, their love story fails, which has less to do with the prejudices from Molly's relatives than with Robert who actually wants to serve his friend as messenger of love but himself falls in love with Molly. William leaves Molly and becomes one of the leaders of the Haitian Revolution, turning the French colony Saint-Domingue into Haiti, the first state governed by black people.Plot can be found at: William the Negro Although Fischer does not completely discard contemporary racism, she does clearly speak out against slavery and argues in favour of human rights for all people. Caroline Fischer published a few narratives in magazines between 1816 and 1820, but then stopped. Carl Wilhelm Otto August von Schindel wrote in his 1825 book German Female Writers of the 19th Century: \\"Rather than those of other people, she has been gathering her own thoughts about women for eighteen years now in order to put them together in a book. Considering her circumstances she has not been able to determine when and if the book will be released.\\"Cited in Elke Spitzer: Emanzipationsanspr√ºche zwischen der Querelle des Femmes und der modernen Frauenbewegung: der Wandel des Gleichheitsbegriffs am Ausgang des 18.

The park is named after St. Columba, who is the city's patron saint. The park contains the ruins of a medieval church, an 18th century manor house, as well as many modern amenities such as a leisure centre and sports pitches. The park has undergone many improvement works in recent decades as part of a redevelopment of the wider area. In 2011 the Peace Bridge was opened, which provides the park with a direct connection into the heart of the city centre via the developed Ebrington Square which hosted the British Army until 2002. In 2015 the new leisure centre, Foyle Arena, was opened at a cost of ¬£12 million and contains a swimming pool, gym, and climbing wall as well as other amenities. In July 2019 a revamped entrance into the park was opened at a cost of ¬£385,000. The work changed the route of the road that leads to St. Columb‚Äôs Park House to improve safety and included a grand new entrance gate. Work is also being done to reopen the old walled garden of the manor house. Since the completion of the Waterside Greenway the park has a direct pedestrian and cycle path that connects to both the Peace Bridge and Gransha Park. There are plans to extend the Greenway further which will connect Strathfoyle directly to the park. History Ruins of St Brecan's Church Contained within the park are the ruins of the medieval St. Brecan‚Äôs Church. The history of the site dates back to at least the 12th century, although most of the original church was demolished in the mid-15th century as the Bishop for the area wished to use the stones to build a palace. Whilst the current ruins were originally built in the late 16th century, they may incorporate some features of the earlier church. At the centre of the park is St. Columb‚Äôs Park House, which was built in 1788 by Lieutenant John Rea, an officer in the Royal Navy. The estate was passed down through his daughter into the wealth Hill family, who were baronets and owned the nearby Brooke Hall. The Hill family crest is still visible above the entrance to the park house. The estate subsequently passed onto the Cooke family in the 1890s, before it was bought by the council in 1937 for a total of ¬£4972 (equating to roughly ¬£340,000 in 2019) and opened to the public in 1939. During WWII the estate was requisitioned by the British Army, due to its proximity to Ebrington Barracks and Clooney Base. It was used during the war as a military hospital to treat those who‚Äôd been injured during the Battle of the Atlantic. After the war the hospital continued to be used by the health board until 1985. After falling into disrepair, the Park House was renovated in 1993 and re-opened to the public. As part of the 2012 London Olympics flame relay, the running track in the park hosted the Derry stop. Amenities The park is home to many facilities that can be used or rented by members of the public. These include: * Foyle Arena ‚Äì Leisure centre which includes a gym and a climbing wall * Tennis courts *All weather sports pitches *Running Track *Children‚Äôs play area *Adventure play area *Walled garden Art There are also several pieces of public art within St. Columb's Park. Amongst them is a bronze statue of the park's namesake, St. Columba, releasing a dove whilst gesturing across the river towards the city. Furthermore outside of Foyle Arena there is a statue called 'Judo Players' by Northern Irish artist F.E. McWilliam. The piece was originally commissioned in 1980 and was moved to its current location after the completion of Foyle Arena in 2015.

Estimates indicated that 4,914,000 AP tests were taken online due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with some experiencing technical difficulties while submitting their examinations. In response, a lawsuit of 500 million USD was filed against the College Board over a planned operation of letting its students cheat in their exam to profit.  Controversies = Previous controversies  The College Board was notable for previous criticism received by other students and teachers. This involved fees to take an exam which were high if a student was taking it late. Other activity was also reported such as sale of student data in 2019 ($0.47 per student name to access their info), SAT Exams being recycled, and reporting errors. In the earlier years, the College Board was allegedly was in violation of their nonprofit status on education, with the company's CEO earning more than $1.3 million in 2019.Costello, Carol. (December 29, 2009). \\"Educating America: The big business of the SAT\\", CNN. Retrieved July 8, 2010.  Phishing scam  On April 1, 2020, the College Board allegedly created an account and subreddit on Reddit, for the intention of posing as a student to find and cancel the scores of other students who intended to cheat. The account was later criticized for being a Phishing scam, attempting to collect student data of supposedly cheating students. Before the events took place, the sub-reddit page r/APexams2020 was created in which posts have by the account included encouragements to cheat during the exam. On May 12, 2020, the subreddit was inundated with photos of anime pornography.  COVID-19 pandemic and controversy  As the COVID-19 pandemic prevailed and damaged education in over 190 countries, leading to school closures in many nations. By March 2020, College Board announced the cancellation of several SAT test dates during the spring of 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The AP examinations were taken online and only lasted only 45 minutes. Later, students reported troubleshooting problems that they were not able to submit leading to over 10,000 students that did not pass the exam and having to retake it. This led to a controversy of violating consumer rights. As all the exams for a particular subject test were taken at the same time, regardless of time zone, many students who live outside of the United States claimed that the times were inconvenient to take the tests at, with some students needing to take certain tests in the middle of the night. In response, the College Board has offered free CLEP testing to students overseas who were unsatisfied with their scores.  Lawsuit  Over the failure of many students, on May 16, 2020 a federal lawsuit was filed out with 500 million USD due to misleading, violation of non-profit, unjust enrichment and other. FairTest was involved criticizing College Board for its controversial monopoly on education. An earlier lawsuit was filed when the company was caught illegally selling student data.

In 2016 he won a court case against the U.S. Department of Defense and gained permission to wear a religious beard and turban in uniform. Capt. Singh asked the Army in October 2015 to allow him to wear his beard and turban. They granted him temporary accommodation in December 2015. When the accommodation was about to expire in February 2016, the Army told Captain Singh to report for a series of tests. Singh sued on the grounds that other soldiers were not required to do similar activities and that the test was religious discrimination. In 2016 he won a permanent accommodation, making him the first active duty Sikh soldier to be approved to dress with his religious beliefs while in active duty. In January 2017, the Army issued new regulations stating that all Sikh soldiers can wear their religious articles while serving. Singh is currently in a staff position at Fort Belvoir, Virginia. Singh's great grandfather served in World War I for the British Indian Army.

He then read for his Doctor of Philosophy degree at Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences on The dietary fibre complex of rye grain, with emphasis on arabinoxylan and successfully completed it in 1999. His PhD was supervised by Per √Öman.  Research and career  Upon completing his PhD, Nilsson spent two years (2002 - 2003) at Aveiro, Portugal as a Postdoctoral Research Associate working on food science and NMR. In 2003, he joined the University of Manchester as a Postdoctoral Research Associate and in 2007 was granted an EPSRC Advance Research Fellowship. In 2012, he became a Lecturer, and was later on promoted to the position of Reader in 2013 and then to the position of Professor of Physical Chemistry in 2018. During the period of 2012 to 2015, he also held a joint position as an Associate professor at University of Copenhagen. Nilsson's research in general is based on physical chemistry and analytical chemistry, specifically on the development and application of novel methods in Liquids NMR Spectroscopy. Apart from research and lecturing, Nilsson also is part of the NMR Group at University of Manchester along with Gareth A. Morris, Ralph Adams. He was the Co-Organiser of the Pure Shift Workshop held on 2017 at University of Manchester. He was also one of the invited speakers at the 12th Australian and New Zealand Society for Magnetic Resonance Conference (ANZMAG) in 2019.  Notable work  In 2010, Nilsson participated in a research which was able to show that suppressing multiplet structure in 1H NMR is able to enhance the resolution of spectra significantly, even to the extent of a GHz range spectrometer. This Pure Shift technique can be also extended to multidimensional spectroscopic techniques including DOSY. The issue with NMR sensitivity and resolution is that complex multiplets maybe caused by homonuclear scalar coupling and the suppression will significantly reduce the density of signals in a spectrum. The research showed how Second Generation Pure Shift Techniques can be used in such cases without causing such disruption to the spectra, and further, giving resolution equivalent to spectrometers of several GHz with mM sensitivity. Nilsson also developed the DOSY Toolbox in 2009, a free program for processing PFG NMR diffusion data. The Toolbox is completely free-standing in the sense that all necessary basic processing of NMR data is catered for within the programme, as well as a number of methods specific to DOSY data (e.g., DOSY and SCORE).

Willem Doorn Rev. Willem Doorn (April 24, 1836 ‚Äì October 25, 1908) was a Duch vicar. Rev. Doorn was known by his role as vicar of the Dutch Reformed Church at the Nobel Street in The Hague, where he served for 33 years and excelled in exegesis and homiletics, by his role as chairman of the board of the Theological University of Kampen and by his role in the General Synode of The Netherlands. He was born in Zwolle, in 1836, as son of Petrus Doorn and Lienna Jacoba Krans, descendant of Hendrik Doorn (Doren) born 1720, and probably a descendant of Jan (Jansen) Doorn (Doren) born 1640, living on the estate Den Doren in Haerst, The Netherlands.  Early life  Rev. Doorn was raised in Zwolle, The Netherlands, as oldest one in a family with four children and two working parents. Already at a young age he had the desire to become a vicar. This wish was tried for quite a while, because initially the way wasn‚Äôt paved. Eventually, he was given the opportunity to move from Zwolle to Kampen and to enroll at the Theological University of Kampen. His years of study went very well. In 1865, at the age of 29, he became Candidate in Theology. On October 25th of the same year, he was ordained as vicar in Deventer, by his tutor Prof. H. De Cock.  Ministry  Already since 1865, in his first congregation in Deventer, The Netherlands, the work of Rev. Doorn has been very blessed. During his church services, a lot of people repented or got converted. From the many aspects of the ministry, he preferred working under the youth, and visiting the ill to bring them the comfort of the gospel. A year after his ordination, when cholera was raging in The Netherlands, he wasn‚Äôt sparing himself and brought words of exhortation and comfort wherever he was called to go, even outside the circles of his own congregation. In 1873, he left as vicar from Deventer to a congregation in Heerenveen. Financially, there were better options for him at that time, but the Dutch province Friesland where Heerenveen was situated, attracted him. Still, he worked there shortly. With a view to the upbringing of his children, in 1875, he accepted the position as vicar at the Nobel Street Church in The Hague, The Netherlands. Nobel Street Church in 1875 The congregation at the Nobel Street Church was halved after a church split in 1857. When Rev. Doorn took up office in 1875, the church had just grown back to 523 members, which was the amount in 1857. With Rev. Doorn, ‚Äúbeing averse to cold intellectualism and unhealthy mysticism‚Äù as an observer noticed, the Nobel Street Church got a unifying and vibrant vicar. During his years in office, the congregation increased to 1300 members. Rev. Doorn stayed vicar here for 33 years, till he passed away. During his sermons, Rev. Doorn excelled in exegesis. His text partitioning testified of homiletic skills and marked him as a student of Prof. v. Velzen. He shunned flowery language and phantasies and was known for his solid outlines, clarity and anointing. At special occasions, he could preach with power and great flow. Where he was pleading, his style was more warmth and with passion. His sermons especially spread comfort among the brethren. He could encourage the anxious soul and bring it into Gods hand, as a mean to rejoice the Christian faith. In his ministry, there was a peculiar mixture of gentleness and strength. Sin and mercy were never missing.  Other activities  A salient character trait of Rev. Doorn was his active nature. He worked seven days a week, from early morning till late in the evening. For years, he led confirmation classes after the morning service, and after the evening service, he led meetings for the youth. Taking vacation was foreign to him. He participated in many committees, was chairman of the board of the Theological School (now: Theological University of Kampen), board member of the Orphanage of Middelharnis, and representative in the General Synode of The Netherlands. Also, continues study stood high on his personal agenda. For decades, he devoted his Saturday to scripture study, till deep in the night. Only in later years, he allowed himself to go to bed as early as at midnight. Rev. Doorn was also known by his stable and dependable character. At his grave, people testified that loyalty was one of his most prominent traits. One could count on him, entrust him the biggest secrets. He could have been rightfully called ‚ÄúWillem de Zwijger‚Äù (translated: William the Silent‚Äù). This trait caused him to have the trust of many people in the congregation. ‚ÄúWhen I die, I‚Äôll take many secrets to the grave‚Äù, was a sentence he mentioned occasionally. Besides, there was decisiveness in his comings and goings, and consistency in his way, which didn‚Äôt deter him from conciliating as well. Though loyal to the church, churchism was foreign to Rev. Doorn. As during his 25th jubilee of holding the office, Rev. Hoogstraten was attending his service, and it was just typical to Rev. Doorn to address some kind words during the sermon to this fellow minister from a different reformed denomination. Again, in his sermon during his 40th jubilee of holding the office, he directed some words to brethren from this different reformed denomination, though with the same confession of faith. As he said: ‚ÄùWe don‚Äôt differ in the essence of our message. Only in the contemplations of some side issues, we think differently.‚Äù It was therefore rather painful for his heart, seeing a lot of people not joining the Unity of the Reformed Churches in 1892, and establishing a separate unity called the Christian Reformed Church.  Marriage  At October 5th 1865, twenty days before taking up office in Deventer, Rev. Doorn married Gesina Bosch, born in Zwolle at March 2nd 1839, daughter of Albertus Bosch and Elsje Poortier. The Handbook for the Dutch Reformed Churches, edition 1909, testifies that Rev. Doorn and Gesina Bosch were intimately connected, and that Gesina knew how to tactfully cheer up her husband in discouraging moments. Also, in a book in a word of thanks, in 1890, their children testify of a marriage that has been blessed and strengthened by God. When Gesina passed away, in The Hague on July 14, 1892, they were married for 27 years. Rev. Doorn and Gesina Bosch got 7 children: # Petrus, born in Deventer 07‚Äì28-1866, drawing teacher in 1896 living in Alkmaar, and from 1905 till 1910 living in Haarlem, CEO of the Royal Academy of Art in The Hague from 1915 till 1928, died in Zeist 27-02-1941, married in The Hague 07‚Äì24-1896 Maria Wilhelmina van Baalen, born in Weesp 05-29-1872, died in Zeist 11-03-1947. # Elize Dirkje, born in Deventer 09-02-1868, living in Zeist in 1908, died in Veenendaal (buried in The Hague) 06-13-1923. # Albertus, born in Deventer 02-10-1871, ordained as vicar in Axel 11-25-1894, vicar in Franeker from 1897 till 1908, vicar in Apeldoorn from 1908 till 1923, vicar in Heerde from 1923 till 1933, died in Apeldoorn 01-30-1950, married 11-15-1894 Hermina Johanna Willemine van Teijlingen, born in Hillegom 01-25-1873, died in Apeldoorn 03-09-1946. # Willem, born in Heerenveen 07-10-1873, watch maker with own store and workshop at Noordeinde 115A in The Hague and later at Piet Heinstraat 61, died in The Hague 05‚Äì18-1939, married in Rotterdam 03-28-1907 Elisabeth Johanna Hagenbeek, born in Deventer 01-01-1877, died in Breda (buried in The Hague) 03-28-1965, daughter of Jan Jacob Hagenbeek (paper maker / miller) and Geertruida Straalman. # Lina Jacoba, born in The Hague 02-17-1876, living in The Hague in 1908, died in The Hague 03-17-1943. # Frederik, born in The Hague 09-24-1879, died in The Hague 02-18-1880 (4 months old). # Frederik (Frits), living in Amsterdam in 1908.  Honours  Coat of Arms Family Doorn In 1900, in a book presented to Rev. Doorn by his fellow members in office, on the occasion of his 25th jubilee as vicar in the Nobel Street Church, a Coat of Arms was found, designed and drawn by his son Petrus Doorn, drawing teacher in 1896 and CEO of the Royal Academy of Art in The Hague from 1915 till 1928. In 2013, the Coat of Arms is stylized and registered at the Dutch Association of Genealogy (see external links). The motto on the scroll refers to the Bible: 1 Thessalonians 5 verse 8 (KJV): ‚ÄúBut let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope of salvation.‚Äù In 1902, August 28th, Rev. Doorn was appointed a Knight in the Order of Oranje Nassau by Queen Wilhelmina of The Netherlands. Reason for distinction as recorded: ‚ÄúWalks his path in quiet simplicity. Completely committed to his important work, and loyal in looking after the interests of his blessed congregants, he is deeply loved, while also acknowledged outside his denomination. He is the oldest vicar holding the office in the Dutch Reformed Church‚Äù.  Death  Though more slender built than having a strong and broad body, Rev. Doorn has worked non-stop until his last breath. On October 25, 1908, after 43 years in office, whereof 33 years in the Nobel Street Church, he suddenly passed away at the age of 72 in The Hague. ‚ÄúAs always, he had prepared for the sermon and laid out the things to take with him to the Eastern Church where he would preach that morning. However, the night before, he got a light fever which made him decide in the morning to stay in bed. Just before the service, he requested Rev. v.d. linden to come, to talk about the announcements in church that morning. Right after, he got a disruption in his breathing. While Rev. v.d. Linden went to the consistorial room to call in a doctor, Rev. Doorn died in the arms of his youngest daughter, who was the only one at home at the moment. Rev. Doorn is buried on the last Thursday of October 1908, on the cemetery Oud-Eik-en-Duinen, where thousands were gathered that day, showing that he lived in many hearts.‚Äù  Bibliography  * (Dutch) De verlossing van Paulus en Silas uit de boeien: lerende over Hand. 16:25-34 (1870) * (Dutch) De vergiffenis der zonden aan het afgekeerde Israel door den Here beloofd: leerrede ter voorbereiding voor het Avondmaal over Jezaja 1:16-18 (1871) * (Dutch) Het lied der engelen in de velden van Betlehem: kerstpreek over Lucas 2:13-14 (1872) * (Dutch) Paulus‚Äô dankerkentenis voor des Heeren ondersteuning in de bediening des Evangelies: gedachtenisrede na volbrachte vijf-en-twintigjarige evangeliebediening (1890) * (Dutch) Paulus‚Äô roem in de hulpe des Heeren tot vervulling zijner bediening: gedachtenisrede na volbrachte veertigjarige ambtsbediening op October 1905 (1905) * (Dutch) Overdenkingen: sprekende nadat hij is gestorven, bundel met selectie van 32 schriftbeschouwingen van Ds.

Melville's advocacy for Guatemala led her and her husband to join the group known as the Catonsville Nine. Early life Born in 1929 in Irapuato, Guanajuato, Mexico, she is the daughter of a Mexican-American mother and an American father. Growing up in the 1930s under Mexico's prevalent anti- Catholicism, she learned about home masses and sisters who had to remain incognita while teaching. Religious life In St. Louis, Missouri she joined the Maryknoll Sisters of St. Dominic in 1949 as Sister Marian Peter, and remained for almost two decades. She graduated from Mary Rogers College in Ossining, N.Y. with a bachelor of education degree in 1954. She was sent by her order that year to Jacaltenango, a remote community in Huehuetenango in Guatemala's western highlands. Her posting in Guatemala in 1954 coincided with the year Carlos Castillo Armas overthrew Jacobo √Årbenz, with the support of the CIA. Although she worked in a prosperous area as a teacher, the Maryknollers gradually became more aware of the plight of the Guatemalan poor, and she began taking short courses with the Jesuits on these issues, and studied both in Guatemala and the United States. Marriage In Mexico City she married Thomas R. Melville, a former Catholic Maryknoll priest, who had worked in Guatemala for ten years before also being expelled in 1967 by Guatemalan and Church authorities for his role in planning the formation of a Christian unit to graft onto the guerrilla movement that was fighting Guatemala's military rulers. (Margarita Melville Papers) Their story is told in detail in their memoir, Whose Heaven, Whose Earth (Knopf 1971). Catonsville Nine The Catonsville Nine used homemade napalm to burn draft records in the parking lot of the Catonsville, Maryland draft board on May 17, 1968. Although the Catonsville Nine is widely believed to have acted in protest of Vietnam, for the Melvilles it was much more about Guatemala. According to Peters (80), Tom Melville committed to the action without discussing it with Marjorie, who had deep reservations. They were newlyweds, and she dreaded the idea of jail apart from one another for months or years. She finally decided of her own free will to participate. It was she and Mary Moylan who went into the Draft Board offices first, alongside Tom Lewis. Peters notes that she made a point of wearing a dress that wouldn't wrinkle in anticipation of being arrested and unable to change for a couple of days (97). She blocked one of the female clerks in the raid by putting one hand on the desk and the other on a wall. She also provided a safety pin for George Mische's trousers that famously came loose, part of what Mische later called the \\"comic opera\\" of the raid. Before reporting to the Federal Women's Prison Camp in Alderson, West Virginia for her two-year sentence, she and her husband spoke to many antiwar groups. Because she spoke fluent Spanish from her years in Guatemala, she befriended many of the Spanish-speaking women in prison. Post-prison Jane Fonda and Donald Sutherland hoped to play the Melvilles in a movie about their book, but it never materialized because the Melvilles had second thoughts. Melville graduated with a M.A. in Latin American studies and Ph.D. in Anthropology from the American University, Washington, D.C. She joined the University of Houston in 1976, where she continued her work as an activist for women's and Chicano causes. She left the University of Houston for the University of California, Berkeley in 1986, where she was a Professor and Associate Dean until her retirement in 1995.(Papers of Margarita Melville) ReferencesExternal links * http://c9.digitalmaryland.org/page.php?ID=16 Her book Twice A Minority (as Margarita A.

On Saturday 6 June 1981 she was cycling the four miles from her home at Basingbourne Close in FleetMan charged with 1981 murder - BBC News 7 September 2001 to attend a clarinet lesson at The Wavell School in Farnborough. Ordinarily her father drove her there but on this occasion he was playing in a cricket match. Her route took her along Laffans Road in Aldershot alongside the Basingstoke Canal. Here between 9.30 and 10.00 am she was attacked and beaten into unconsciousness, leaving her with severe bruising and a bleed on the brain. After being dragged into the wooded area by the side of the road she was raped and murdered. The attacker left traces of his DNA in and on her body as well as on her jeans and her left sock. Her body was then hidden in the undergrowth where it was found later that day by a police dog handler.Charlotte Greig, Criminal Cold Cases, Arcturus (2012) - Google Books Her clarinet case was flung into the nearby Basingstoke Canal where it was later retrieved. In an interview with the Daily Mail published on 8 June 1981 her father Trevor Crofts said: Front page of the Daily Mail, 8 June 1981 > I was told to identify the body of my youngest daughter - she was in a > terrible state.

Tony Jasinskyj was a lance corporal in the Army Catering Corps based in Aldershot and was living in army married quarters about a mile and a half away from the murder scene with his pregnant wife Lynn Gowans, whom he had married in 1976. He was among hundreds of men questioned as to their whereabouts at the time of the murder. Following the murder DNA evidence was deliberately withheld in the expectation that testing techniques would advance in the future which would find a match. In the meantime the DNA samples from her body and clothing were carefully sealed to avoid cross contamination and documented in detail.Cold Case Successes - Police Professional website The case was shown in a reconstruction at Laffans Road on the BBC One's Crimewatch on 22 February 2000. Crofts was attacked on this stretch of Laffans Road in Aldershot - shown in 2020 The murder remained a cold case until in 1999 a DNA profile was obtained from the withheld material using the new Low copy number (LCN) testing technique. This was continually checked against the UK National DNA Database for the next two years until a match was eventually found for Tony Jasinskyj, who by then had been discharged from the Army Catering Corps and was working as a security guard in Leicester where he was living at Kegworth Avenue with his second wife, Michelle, having been divorced from his first wife since 1984. On being arrested for assaulting his wife police took a routine DNA sample and fed details into a databank. On finding a match Jasinskyj was arrested in April 2001 and charged with the rape and murder of Marion Crofts in 1981. He denied the charges. At his trial at Winchester Crown Court experts pointed out that DNA material from Crofts was present in the sample taken from her body and the clothing she had been wearing. The jury were told that the DNA match to Jasinskyj was one in a billion. After a four week trial the jury deliberated for three hours before finding Jasinskyj guilty of both charges. He was sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder and to 10 years for the rape, to run concurrently.Ex-chef jailed for schoolgirl murder - The Independent, 11 May 2002 In sentencing him Judge Michael Brodrick told Jasinskyj that he had committed a \\"cruel and callous murder\\" and had given Croft's family 21 years of suffering as they thought of \\"the final, dreadful, brutal moments of her life\\".Marion Crofts , FSS In 2014 Jasinskyj appealed his life sentence, arguing before Lady Justice Macur QC, Lord Justice Phillips and Judge Neil Ford QC at the Court of Appeal in London that the DNA evidence produced at his 2002 trial was 'flawed' as it contained material from the victim suggesting that the murderer had a chromosome disorder - meaning he had been wrongfully convicted. The Appeal Judge Lord Justice Phillips said the original verdict was \\"entirely safe\\" and dismissed Jasinskyj's claim as \\"fanciful\\", stating that his \\"fixation on an anomaly\\" could not outweigh the one in a billion probability that Jasinskyj had committed the rape and murder.Marion Crofts murder: Tony Jasinskyj's appeal refused - BBC News, 2 July 2014 Marion Croft's remains were cremated.

Khalili. The collection was built up over a period of 25 years and contains 100 works. It is one of eight collections assembled, conserved, published and exhibited by Khalili, each of which is considered among the most important in its field. In 2008 it was described as \\"the only extensive collection of Swedish flatweaves outside the country\\". The collection consists mostly of textile panels, cushion and bed covers from the Scania region of southern Sweden, dating in the main from a hundred-year period between the mid-18th and mid-19th centuries. The majority of the pieces in the collection were made for wedding ceremonies in the region. While they played a part in the ceremonies, they were also a reflection of the artistry and skill of the weaver. Their designs often consist of symbolic illustrations of fertility and long life. 12px This article incorporates text from this source, which is licensed under CC-BY-SA 3.0. Khalili writes that he created the collection because of the tendency of art historians and the public to undervalue art whose creators are anonymous.  Background: the high era of Swedish textile art  Bara district, Scania, late 18th century Handwoven textile art flourished in Scania from the mid-eighteenth to the mid-nineteenth century. Employment in Scania was mainly in farming, and the early eighteenth century was a time of relative peace and prosperity for farmers, with far fewer epidemics than previously. The women of land-owning families, with the skills for making clothes and furnishings, thus had the leisure time and materials to make textiles with a focus on beauty rather than for use as covering. These textiles would usually be kept in a wooden chest, only brought out for special occasions or for airing. Wealthy farms would often have a dedicated chamber for these chests. The creators of these works were exclusively women: farmers' wives, other female members of the family, or occasionally maids. Some works bear initials, but the identity of the creators is unknown. The creation of a dowry was an important tradition, and for each wedding the bride would demonstrate her skill by creating unique textiles with symbolic decorations. From the mid-nineteenth century onwards, the collections were mostly sold off and put to everyday use, subjecting them to wear. Only a few thousand works from this period survive intact to the present day.  Techniques and designs  Interlocked tapestry (Women and Birds in Stars and Hearts) from Ingelstads district, Scania, first half of the 19th century * Dove-tail tapestry, also called (\\"Flemish weave\\"): these are named for the joins between areas of colour, where weft threads of different areas connect around the same warp thread. This technique was common among wealthy Malm√∂ households from the mid sixteenth century to the mid eighteenth. Many tapestries from this era have been lost in war and in fires. These tapestries are usually pictorial, depicting people, animals or flowers on a dark background. Religious scenes, especially the Annunciation, were common subjects. Hunting was another common subject. * Interlocked tapestry or (various spellings): double interlocked tapestry, in which the weft threads interlock on the reverse of the textile, was a common technique in southern Sweden. Designs of these tapestries were typically geometrical, including stars, rosettes and octagons. Zig-zag patterns representing lightning, in a variety of colours and widths, were commonly used as both a motif and a background pattern. Interlocked tapestries mostly used linen for the warp threads and wool for the weft, with other fibres like hemp, jute, and cotton used much less frequently. * Simple weaves: simple weaves with little or no pattern were normally used for parts of fabrics, including backings or foundations to which more decorative layers would be added. * Weft patterning: in continuous weft patterning, weft threads do not turn at the edge of a motif. In extra-weft patterning, the pattern is produced by an additional set of weft threads. This is an old technique, dating back to Viking times, and was often used for the backs of textiles whose fronts were created with interlocked tapestry. There are several distinct styles of extra-weft patterning, including (\\"crab-snare\\"), (\\"half- crab\\"), (\\"monk's belt\\"), (\\"up-catch\\") and (\\"table-path\\"). * Knotted-pile weaves: (piled weavings) were common as cushion or bed covers from the eighteenth century onwards. Coloured wool was wrapped around pairs of warp threads to create the pile surface, either by being cut or left as loops. * Embroideries: these can be (\\"wool embroidery\\"), which have an embroidered pattern on a plain background, or (\\"cross-stitch\\") and (\\"twist-stitch\\") which involve a fully-embroidered surface. Dove-tail tapestry (Flowers, Birds and People) from Torna district, Scania, second half of the 18th century The textiles use variations of a set of design motifs, including hunt scenes, stars, and geometrical shapes. Despite this, each textile is different, varying by colour, size, positioning and combination of the motifs. Designs show a lot of similarity across the different techniques, apart from dove-tail tapestry, whose designs are more realistic and naturalistic. Whereas stylised animals within octagons are a common motif for the other textiles, dove-tail tapestries more often have a naturalistic animal or bird within a circle. A textile creator would rarely venture beyond her own village, so her imagery would have been drawn from nature and from local superstition and religion. Another influence was textile art from other cultures. For thousands of years, textiles had been traded across Europe and Asia, and pictorial designs from the Near East are known to have been imported to Sweden by the fourteenth or fifteenth century.  Works in the collection  Interlocked tapestry, (Two Reindeer in Octagons with People) from Ingelstads or Herrestads district, Scania, first half of the 19th century The hundred art works in Khalili collection show the variety as well as the skill of Swedish textile artists. The collection is particularly strong in interlocked tapestries and dove-tail tapestries, but also has examples of the other techniques. Some of the designs are repeating patterns while some have a design constructed around a central motif. Very common motifs are people, animals or birds within octagons or circles, and most permutations of creature and geometric shape are represented in the collection. Five objects in the collection depict prancing, open- mouthed deer within octagons, which is the most prized design for Swedish textiles. One particularly elaborate bed covering has six octagons each containing pictorial scenes of people or horses. An interlocked tapestry depicts (mythological horses with horns) and a linen cloth with extra-weft patterning depicts lions. Dove-tail tapestries tend to be more pictorial and realistic than the other types of textiles, and this is reflected in the collection by tapestries depicting the Annunciation, red lions, and naturalistic floral arrangements. Ascending floral lattice designs are another feature that occurs across multiple objects. This design likely reflects Italian influence. An interlaced knots motif, found it many kinds of decorative art, is exemplified by embroidered works and a knotted-pile cover in the collection. This knotted-pile weaving is thought to originate in K√•llands√∂ because of its design. The Marby Rug is a knotted-pile carpet found in a church in J√§mtland, central Sweden in 1925. It is believed to have come from fourteenth- or fifteenth-century Anatolia. It depicts pairs of birds facing a tree, under the wings of a great bird, and is the only known Eastern rug with this design. Multiple Swedish textiles copied this design, possibly copying this specific rug, and one such cross-stitch embroidery is in the Khalili Collection.

Club History  The Mount Barker Football Club was 1881 although at the time there was no formal football competition within the Adelaide Hills region. During the club's first twenty years of competition games were played between clubs in the Hills, Mount Lofty and Torrens Valley areas and even clubs such as Norwood and Port Adelaide who were competing in the former South Australian Football Association at the time. Despite the design and shade of blue that have both changed over time, the official colours of the Mount Barker Football Club have always been blue and white. Two ovals were used in the club's early days, one being Mr Weld's paddock, now known as Weld Park, and Dunn Park, which is now home to the Mount Barker Caravan Park. Mount Barker were one of the original five foundation clubs of the Hills Football Association when it was founded in 1902 and reached the league's inaugural Grand Final, only to go down to Woodside. Mount Barker had left the association during the middle of the 1906 season alleging that league officials had exhibited bias towards the club, after they had previously won premierships in 1903 and 1905. The club re-entered the association in 1907 and became one of the more dominant clubs in the association until 1929 when the Roos briefly competed in the South Australian Amateur Football League from 1930 to 1932. This saw the club decline due to extra travel for games and players retiring. Mount Barker joined the Mount Lofty Football Association in 1933 and remained there until 1937 where the Roos took out the 1933 and 1935 premierships before moving back to the Hills Football Association in 1938 where they remained until 1953. Mount Barker went through the 1938 season undefeated and beating Hahndorf in the Grand Final, and winning another premiership in 1948. Mount Barker went to the Hills Central Football Association in 1954 and remained there until 1966, where the club won a total of five premierships and were runners up three times. The Hills Central Football Association, Hills Football Association and Torrens Valley Football Association merged to form the current Hills Football League in 1967 where Mount Barker was placed within the top tier along with seven other clubs, winning their first two flags within the new three-tier competition in 1969 and 1970. Mount Barker is currently only 3 inaugural members of the Hills Football League, along with Lobethal and Onkaparinga Valley. Mount Barker's most recent premiership was in 2012, beating Uraidla Districts by 15 points. The Mount Barker Football Club introduced their first women's football team in 2016 that took out the South Australian Women's Football League Division 2 title of that year, beating Mount Lofty in the Grand Final by 7 points at Guardall Security Stadium.

The earliest slave funds were created in the 17th century by members of the Hanseatic League.

It began operations on May 8th 1629 and existed until the mid 19th century. With the decline of L√ºbeck's direct shipping connections to the Mediterranean sea, the city's slave fund was highly liquid from the 18th century onwards.Rezension Gra√ümann : PDF (p.455) The last ransom payment was made in 1805, while its remaining assets afterwards were used to pay the Sound Dues (1857) and to fund the city's customs authority.

Service in the Revolutionary War During the Revolutionary War Fish Carrier worked to reduce tensions between the Senecas and Oneidas tribes who supported British and American forces respectively. Fish Carrier was one of the signatories of the Tioga Point Treaty witnessed by Samuel Denny Street under Timothy Pickering and received a silver medal from George Washington and a parcel of land in 1792. Details of the negotiations were published in the The American Museum. He was present at the council that decided the Canandaigua Treaty. He was an adviser to Red Jacket during the council at Buffalo Creek in 1791. After the war Anna Shepard Perkins, in Early Times on the Susquehanna, writes about Fish Carrier at a ceremony to adopt Robert Morris into the Senecas following his acquisition of the Phelps and Gorham Purchase. The ceremony became tense following dances and songs of battles between the Senecas and the Oneidas, and knives were drawn. Fish Carrier stood up, \\"striking the post with violence\\", and shouted \\"You are all a parcel of boys; when you have all attained my age, and performed the warlike deeds that I have performed, you may boast what you have done; not till then!\\" In 1807, his name appears as Hojawgata. It was later preserved amongst Canadian Cayugas. Family Fish Carrier had three children, a daughter and two sons. The ethnographer Lewis H. Morgan bought a conch shell breastplate for $5 from Peter Fish Carrier, Fish Carrier's son.

The group is made up of more than a hundred legal experts in environmental law and is chaired by former COP21 President Laurent Fabius. On 10 May 2018, the United Nations General Assembly adopted, by 142 votes in favor, 5 votes against (United States, Russia, Syria, Turkey, and the Philippines) and 7 abstentions (Saudi Arabia, Belarus, Iran, Malaysia, Nicaragua, Nigeria, and Tajikistan), a resolution paving the way for the negotiation of a Global Pact for the Environment (Resolution A/72/L.51 of 10 May 2018, ‚ÄúTowards a Global Pact for the Environment‚Äù). Negotiations are still ongoing. On 8 May 2020, the United Nations Environment Programme nominated two co-facilitators to lead the process. Their mandate is to lead informal consultations to prepare a first draft of a ‚Äúpolitical declaration‚Äù that is to be debated at the UN Environmental Assembly‚Äôs fifth session in February 2021. This text is scheduled for adoption at the next Earth Summit in 2022.  Objectives  The Global Pact for the Environment seeks to recognize the rights and duties of citizens and governments towards the Planet. Its approach is to enshrine the fundamental principles of environmental law in a legally binding instrument, thereby remedying the shortcomings of international environmental law. While these principles are already contained in political declarations such as the 1972 Stockholm Declaration and the 1992 Rio Declaration, they currently lack legal force. In contrast to these declarations, a Global Pact would be a multilateral treaty endowed with legal force that would enshrine fundamental environmental rights as well as the principles that guide environmental action. Building on the dynamic of the Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Agreement, a Global Pact would raise the threshold for environmental protection worldwide. It is intended for global adoption. It would complement existing sectoral conventions, such as the Paris Agreement or the Montreal Protocol by enshrining principles that would apply to the Environment as a whole. If adopted, it would be the first international treaty that takes a comprehensive and non-sectorial approach to the environment. The Global Pact‚Äôs methodology to enhance environmental standards is to recognize a ‚Äúthird generation of fundamental rights‚Äù ‚Äì environmental rights. This approach mirrors that of the two international covenants of 1966: the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), which are generally seen as having enshrined the first two generations of human rights. Should a legally binding Global Pact be adopted, United Nations Member States would have to enact ambitious environmental legislation to incorporate the principles of the Global Pact into their national law. In addition, national courts, and particularly supreme courts, will be able to use this Global Pact as a source of law when deciding case-law.  Origins  The Global Pact for the Environment was first proposed in 2017 by an international network of more than a hundred experts (professors, judges, lawyers) from forty different countries now known as the ‚ÄúInternational Group of Experts for the Pact‚Äù (IGEP). The current IGEP chair is Laurent Fabius, President of the French Constitutional Council and former President of COP 21. Its Secretary General is Yann Aguila, lawyer at the Paris Bar and President of the Environment Committee of the Club des Juristes, a French legal think tank. Notable members of IGEP include: * Antonio Herman Benjamin, judge at the Superior Court of Justice of Brazil. * Bruce Ackerman, Sterling professor of law and political science, Yale University. * Laurence Boisson de Chazournes, professor, University of Geneva. * David Boyd, professor of law, University of British Columbia, UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights and the Environment. * Lord Robert Carnwarth, Justice of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom. * Parvez Hassan, senior advocate in the Supreme Court of Pakistan. * Marie Jacobsson, former member of the UN International Law Commission from 2007 to 2016 and special rapporteur. * Donald Kaniaru, former director of environmental implementation at UNEP. * Swatanter Kumar, former judge of the Indian Supreme Court, former president of the National Indian Green Court. * Luc Lavrysen, Dutch Language President of the Belgian Constitutional Court. * Pilar Moraga Sariego, Professor at the Center for Environmental Law, Faculty of Law, University of Chile. * Tianbao Qin, Professor, Wuhan University, Secretary General, Chinese Society for Environmental and Natural Resources Law. * Nicholas A. Robinson, Professor, Elisabeth Haub School of Law, University of Pace, New York. * Jorge E. Vinuales, Professor, University of Cambridge. * Margaret Young, Associate Professor, Faculty of Law, University of Melbourne. Enshrining fundamental principles of environmental law in a universal binding treaty is however not a novel idea. Environmental lawyers have been calling on States to adopt such a treaty at least since the 1987 Brundtland report, that elaborated a list of ‚ÄúLegal Principles for Environmental Protection and Sustainable Development.‚Äù In 1995, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) also proposed a draft International Pact on Environment and Development. In 2015, the Environment Committee of the Club des Juristes likewise proposed the adoption of an international environmental treaty.  Content  A preliminary draft was conceived by IGEP experts in 2017 to serve as a basis for international talks. The definitive wording of the text is still subject to negotiations. The preliminary draft is structured around a preamble and twenty fundamental principles, balanced between rights and duties and supplemented by six articles dealing with final provisions. The text is based on two ‚Äúsource principles‚Äù, a right and a duty: the right to an ecologically sound environment and the duty to take care of the environment. These substantive and procedural principles are already widely established and accepted in previous environmental declarations. Yet, a Global Pact would elevate these principles from guiding ideas to legally binding, enforceable sources of law for legislators and courts in all UN member states. Substantive principles include: * The Prevention Principle (Article 5): necessary measures shall be taken to prevent environmental harm. * The Precautionary Principle (Article 6): where there is a risk of serious or irreversible damage, lack of scientific certainty shall not be used as a reason to prevent environmental degradation. * Duty to Repair Environmental damage (Article 7): necessary measures shall be taken to ensure an adequate remediation of environmental damages. * Polluter-Pays (Article 8): costs for pollution should be borne by their originator. Procedural principles include: * Right to Information (Article 9): every person has a right of access to environmental information held by public authorities. * Public Participation (Article 10): every person has the right to participate to the preparation of decisions that may have a significant effect on the environment. * Access to Environmental Justice (Article 11): States shall ensure the right of effective and affordable remedy to challenge acts that contravene environmental law. The preliminary draft of the Global Pact proposes innovations such as the official recognition of the role of civil society in protecting the environment. It further includes the principle of non-regression, which prohibits going back on existing levels of environmental protection. The preliminary draft also provides for a mechanism to monitor the implementation of the Pact to ensure its effectiveness. This mechanism, which consists of a committee of experts, would be a forum for States to exchange experiences and recommendations in light of national best practices.  Diplomatic Trajectory  The Global Pact draft text was presented for the first time in Paris on June 24, 2017, with attendance from several prominent figures involved in environmental protection, such as Ban Ki-moon, Mary Robinson, Laurent Fabius, Laurence Tubiana, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Anne Hidalgo, Nicolas Hulot, and Manuel Pulgar-Vidal. On 19 September 2017, French President Emmanuel Macron held a ‚ÄòSummit on a Global Pact for the Environment‚Äô on the margins the 72nd session of the UN General Assembly in New York to introduce the project to the diplomatic scene. On this occasion, UN Secretary-General Ant√≥nio Guterres, UN General Assembly President Miroslav Lajƒç√°k and UNEP Executive Director Erik Solheim expressed their support for the project. On 10 May 2018, the United Nations General Assembly adopted resolution 72/277 entitled ‚ÄúTowards a Global Pact for the Environment‚Äù, which formally launched international negotiations on the adoption of such a Pact. It established the negotiations‚Äô terms of reference and provided for: * The presentation of a report by the United Nations Secretary-General to the General Assembly towards the end of 2018, identifying the eventual gaps in international environmental law that the Pact might close. * The creation of an open-ended working group, open to all State members, tasked with examining this report and discussing whether the issues addressed in the report would be solved by the adoption of the Pact as a new international treaty. On 5-7 September 2018, the working group held a first organizational session in New York. There, Member states scheduled for three substantive sessions to take place in Nairobi in January, March, and May 2019. This group was chaired by two co-chairs that were nominated by the President of the United Nations General Assembly, Miroslav Lajƒç√°k. These were Francisco Ant√≥nio Duarte Lopes, Permanent Representative of Portugal and Amal Mudallali, Permanent Representative of Lebanon. In December 2018, the United Nations Secretary-General published his report on the Global Pact for the Environment. The report, entitled ‚ÄúGaps in International Environmental Law and Environment- Related Instruments: Towards a Global Pact for the Environment‚Äù, underlined that the effectiveness of international environmental law could be strengthened by a comprehensive and unifying international instrument that enshrines all the principles of environmental law. Such an instrument ‚Äúcould provide for better harmonization, predictability and certainty\\". In June 2019, the working group adopted recommendations that were in net retreat from the original proposals of the co-chairs. Indeed, States effectively opted for adopting a political declaration in 2022 to coincide with the fiftieth anniversary of the Stockholm Conference. These recommendations constitute a setback to the project‚Äôs initial ambition that aimed for a legally binding international treaty that would enshrine the general principles of environmental law. On 30 August 2019, the United Nations General Assembly adopted resolution 73/333. This resolution ‚Äúnoted with satisfaction the work of the working group‚Äù and ‚Äúagreed with all its recommendations‚Äù. It forwarded these recommendations to the United Nations Environment Assembly for its consideration for it to ‚Äúprepare, at its fifth session, in February 2021, a political declaration for a United Nations high-level meeting, subject to voluntary funding, in the context of the commemoration of the creation of the United Nations Environment Programme by the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, held in Stockholm from 5 to 16 June 1972.‚Äù On 8 May 2020, the President of the United Nations Environment Assembly and the Chair of the Committee of Permanent Representatives nominated two-cofacilitators to lead the negotiations process. These are Saqlain Syedah, from Pakistan and Ado Lohmus, from Estonia. These co-facilitators leading informal consultations to prepare the work of the Environment Assembly‚Äôs fifth session in February 2021. In that context, their mandate is to supervise three consultative meetings, the first of which occurred in June 2020. The other two will be held respectively in November 2020 and February 2021.

Specialising in photographs of children, her work is held in the French National Archives and the Biblioth√®que nationale de France.  Biography  Bandy was born Ida Gurevitsch to a relatively non-religious Jewish family in Tallinn, Estonia, then a part of the Russian Empire. Her family escaped to Moscow at the outbreak of war in 1914, but the Revolution of 1917 nevertheless claimed the life of one of her brothers. In the early 1920s, Bandy remained in Moscow while her mother accompanied her youngest brother Benjamin to Germany. At this time, Bandy met Nicolas Neumann (alias Nicolas Bandy), a Hungarian photographer who mentored her in photography. They married in 1925 but were to divorce later ‚Äì even so, Ina Bandy would keep her pseudonym, moving to Germany before settling in France during the early 1930s. In Paris, she became a member of Alliance Photo, a photographic agency founded by Ren√© Zuber and directed by Maria Eisner, but she would cross into the zone libre at the outbreak of World War II. After World War II, Bandy went back to Paris and moved into the Hotel de Paix, where she set up her workshop on the ground floor. She produced photographic commissions for various newspapers and magazines such as ELLE, M√©decine de France and Art News. While photographing a group of children living at a Paris Metro station for the Combat newspaper, Bandy met Robert Ardouvin, founder of ‚ÄòLes Amis des Enfants de Paris‚Äô. From 1948 the association housed underprivileged children in a village in Vercheny and Bandy helped to photograph these children, remaining attached to the ‚ÄòVillage D‚ÄôEnfants‚Äô until her death in 1973. In 1948, Ina Bandy also became a member of Le Groupe des XV, putting her in the company of other humanist photographers such as Willy Ronis and Sabine Weiss. Bandy also worked for organisations such as UNESCO, Air France, the French National Archives and the Louvre. Her friendship with R√©gine Pernoud, a French medieval historian, would also lead her to take photographs of seals, medals, and medieval churches.  Collections, exhibitions and published work = Collections  A collection of Bandy's photographs are held at the BnF and the French National Archives. She was commissioned by R√©gine Pernoud, conservator at the Museum of History in France between 1949-1974. The Courtauld Institute of Art also holds photographs by Bandy in the Conway Library. They are currently being digitised by the Courtauld Institute of Art, as part of the Courtauld Connects project.

Biography Ettore Baranzini was born on 22 September 1881 in Angera, Italy. His studied at the Pontifical Lombard Seminary from 1899 to 1902. He earned degrees in philosophy from the Pontifical Academy of Saint Thomas Aquinas and in theology and canon law at the Pontifical Gregorian University. He was ordained a priest of the Archdiocese of Milan on 27 March 1904 and in December began a fifteen-year stint secretary to Alessandro Lualdi, the new Archbishop of Palermo. On 28 July 1920, he was named Rector of the Pontifical Lombard Seminary, his alma mater, which Pope Benedict XV had just restored as an independent institution. He attended the 1922 conclave that elected Pope Pius XI as an assistant to Lualdi. On 29 April 1933, Pope Pius XI named him Archbishop of Siracusa. He received his episcopal consecration on 5 June 1933 from Cardinal Francesco Marchetti Selvaggiani; he was installed in Siracusa on 10 September. Baranzini's tomb in the Siracusa Cathedral When the Diocese of Ragusa was created as a suffragan diocese of Siracusa on 6 May 1950 from territory of the Archdiocese of Siracusa, Baranzini was named Bishop of Ragusa while continuing as Archbishop of Siracusa. Baranzini's role in Ragusa ended on 1 October 1955 when that diocese was detached from Siracusa and Francesco Pennisi, its auxiliary bishop since 1950, became its ordinary.

Recorded at several studios in Austin and Dallas, Texas, it was produced solely by the band's frontman Ray Benson and released on August 5, 1980 as the group's only album on MCA Records. Following the departure of the group's primary songwriter LeRoy Preston (and other members) in 1978, the original material on Framed was written primarily by Benson, with Chris O'Connell the only other credited member. Following numerous lineup changes and the band's departure from Capitol Records after five years, Framed marked a stylistic departure for Asleep at the Wheel, who reduced their regular Bob Wills-influenced Western swing output and explored other genres including rock, easy listening and jazz. The album was the group's first not to feature steel guitarist Lucky Oceans, who left Benson as the sole remaining original member when he left in early 1980 to spend time with his family in Australia. Framed was Asleep at the Wheel's last release to chart in the US for ten years, reaching number 191 on the Billboard 200. The album received generally positive reviews from critics, who applauded the band's experimentation with other genres. However, retrospective commentators and band members have identified this departure as the main reason for the group's subsequent dip in popularity. Framed was the band's last album for five years, as lineup changes and financial issues continued. Background Following the release of the band's sixth studio album Collision Course in 1978, vocalist, guitarist and main songwriter LeRoy Preston, pianist Floyd Domino and fiddler Bill Mabry all left Asleep at the Wheel. By the end of the year, bassist Tony Garnier and drummer Chris York had also been replaced. Several members also left after 1979's Served Live, including four recent additions to the lineup and founding steel guitarist Lucky Oceans, who moved to Australia to be with his family. As a result of so many personnel changes and departures, Framed features a reduced lineup of just seven members, including debutants Maryann Price on vocals, Bobby Black on pedal steel guitar, Dean Demmerritt on bass and Billy Estes on drums. The album is the band's first since its 1973 debut Comin' Right at Ya not to feature a full-time fiddler, with only Johnny Gimble credited for the role, and the last to feature saxophonist Pat \\"Taco\\" Ryan, who left soon after its release. Production In early 1980, Asleep at the Wheel signed with MCA Records, ending the band's five year-spell with Capitol. It was originally reported that the group was set to record its first album for the label with esteemed rhythm and blues producer Jerry Wexler, however this idea was later snubbed and the band's frontman Ray Benson ultimately handled the role. Recording was completed between February and May at Austin, Pecan Street and Ruff Cedar Studios in Austin, Texas, and Sumet-Bernet Studios in Dallas. Framed was released by MCA on August 5, 1980. Within just a few weeks, it was announced that vocalist and rhythm guitarist Chris O'Connell had left the band. However, this would later prove to be just a temporary leave of absence, and she continued recording with the band. Discussing the background and production of Framed, frontman Benson claimed in a 2003 interview that a directive from MCA was responsible for the album's departure from country and Western swing music, recalling that \\"The guy at the record label said, \\"Look, I'll give you X amount of dollars to make a record that's anything but country or Western swing music.\\" And it was more money than we'd ever been given to make a record before. We went, \\"Ok!\\" Because they‚Äôd reached a plateau and figured everyone wanted to cross over\\". Describing the release as \\"a fantastic record\\", Benson admitted that \\"It took another couple of years of stumbling around [after the album's release] to realize that ... people all over wanted to hear us do Western swing because nobody else did it, and we did it well.\\" Reception=Commercial Framed was Asleep at the Wheel's last release to chart on the US Billboard 200 albums chart for over ten years, peaking at number 191 (the lowest position of any of the band's charting albums). In other publications, it peaked at number 59 on the Record World country albums chart, and at number 62 on the equivalent chart in Cash Box magazine. Critical Reviews for Framed were generally positive. Cash Box magazine introduced the album as \\"the perfect primer for this campy Texas band\\", describing it as \\"A cross between the Texas swing of Bob Wills and the herky jerky '30s sound of Dan Hicks and his Hot Licks ... more fun than a ride on the mechanical bull at full speed\\". Another review in the same publication a week later noted that \\"many of the tunes are a little \\"rockier\\" than past Asleep works,\\" but assured readers that the \\"distinctive Wheel sound is still intact\\". Record World also highlighted the album's \\"new musical direction\\" and \\"mixture of diverse styles\\". Writing for The Washington Post, Joanne Ostrow spoke highly of the band's decision to move away from traditional country and Western music, proclaiming that \\"the selections display an infectious energy, without the sobbing vocals of mainstream country & western.\\" Ostrow also praised the orchestral performances as \\"smooth\\" and \\"polished\\", commended female vocalists Chris O'Connell and Maryann Price for their \\"bubbling harmonies\\", and applauded frontman Ray Benson's \\"cool crooning\\" voice. She concluded her review by stating that \\"In short, the group is fresh as a country breeze and every bit as cool.\\" Track listingPersonnel Asleep at the Wheel Additional personnel *Ray Benson ‚Äì vocals, lead guitar, tambourine, production *Chris O'Connell ‚Äì vocals, rhythm guitar *Maryann Price ‚Äì vocals *Bobby Black ‚Äì pedal steel guitar *Dean Demmerrit ‚Äì upright and electric basses *Billy Estes ‚Äì drums, percussion *Pat \\"Taco\\" Ryan ‚Äì saxophones, flute *Spencer Starnes ‚Äì bass *Tommy Allsup ‚Äì tic-tac six-string bass *Jamie Oldaker ‚Äì drums, percussion *Fran Christina ‚Äì drums *Chris York ‚Äì percussion *Ron Snyder ‚Äì percussion *Johnny Gimble ‚Äì fiddle *Paul Ostermayer ‚Äì saxophones, flute *Robert Meyer ‚Äì saxophone, trumpet *Frank \\"Jalape√±o\\" Rodarte ‚Äì saxophone *Steve \\"The Doctor\\" Kupka ‚Äì baritone saxophone *Bonnie Raitt ‚Äì vocals *Vince McGarry ‚Äì production assistance, engineering *Linda Bagget ‚Äì production assistance Charts { class=\\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\\"  - !scope=\\"col\\"Chart (1980) !scope=\\"col\\"Peak position - !scope=\\"row\\"US Billboard 200  191 } ReferencesExternal links * Category:Asleep at the Wheel albums Category:1980 albums Category:MCA Records albums ","title":"Framed (Asleep at the Wheel album)"},{"id":"64292822","text":"Tiago Rocha (born 03 March 1994) is a Portuguese handball player for Sporting CP and the Portuguese national team.

There is no record of his Cambridge graduation. Although admitted to the Inner Temple on 25 July 1719, he was not called to the bar. Broome and Pope Thurston became friendly with William Broome, a poet and translator, and the Church of England incumbent of parishes in Suffolk. Broome had been one of three who translated the Iliad into prose, and as an excellent Greek scholar, had joined Pope in translating several books of the Odyssey, in a style almost indistinguishable from Pope's. However, his own verses were of moderate merit. Thurston became known to Pope through Broome. His first book, Poems on Several Occasions (1729), contains love poems and light verse. The Toilette (1730, in two editions) and his mock-heroic poem The Fall (1732) resemble in form Pope's The Rape of the Lock, but have merits of their own as well.

Eisenhower speaking with US Army paratroopers on June 5, 1944 shortly before they parachuted into France The printed version of the order of the day, with a facsimile of Eisenhower's signature, as distributed to members of the Allied Expeditionary Force The June 6, 1944, order of the day was issued by Supreme Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force General Dwight D. Eisenhower to Allied forces on the eve of D-Day, the first day of the invasion of Normandy. The message was intended to impress upon the troops the importance of their mission which Eisenhower called a \\"Great Crusade\\". Eisenhower had been drafting the order since February 1944 and recorded a spoken version on May 28, that was broadcast on British and American radio on D-Day. Background The invasion of Normandy was a significant moment in World War II. A British, American and Canadian Allied Expeditionary Force landed in northern France on June 6, 1944, (D-Day) to begin the liberation of Western Europe from Nazi Germany. Millions of troops were massed in England under the command of Supreme Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force General Dwight D. Eisenhower. As part of the planning, Eisenhower began drafting an order of the day, to be distributed to the invading troops, in February 1944.  Order  The order is addressed to the \\"soldiers, sailors and airmen of the Allied Expeditionary Force ... about to embark upon the Great Crusade\\". It reminds the men that \\"the eyes of the world are upon you\\" and that the \\"hopes and prayers of liberty-loving people everywhere march with you\\" before recognising the contributions made by those fighting the Germans on other fronts. Eisenhower warns the men that the enemy is expected to \\"fight savagely\\" but that the \\"United Nations\\" have defeated German armies elsewhere and that the Allied air offensive has inflicted great damage; he also notes the Allied superiority in men, weaponry and munitions. He concludes by asking his men to pray for God to bless \\"this great and noble undertaking\\". An earlier version of the order used plainer language, having \\"great undertaking\\" in place of \\"Great Crusade\\" and omitting mention of \\"liberty-loving people\\". Eisenhower also changed the placement of phrases in the order. He was responsible for moving the \\"eyes of the world\\" and \\"liberty-loving people\\" sentences from the end of the speech to near the start and for using \\"march with you\\" where the original had \\"go with you\\". Eisenhower also replaced \\"you may expect him to fight savagely\\" with \\"he will fight savagely\\" and the original closing phrase \\"we can and we will win\\" was amended to \\"we accept nothing less than full victory!\\" with an exclamation point added. On the eve of D-Day (June 5, 1944) the order was distributed as a printed leaflet to 175,000 members of the Allied forces. The order was intended to impress upon them the importance of the mission they were about to undertake. At the time of the invasion Eisenhower's order was widely distributed outside of the armed forces‚Äîit was read out to 50,000 people assembled in New York's Central Park on the evening of June 6‚Äîand has been reproduced since in books and films about the war. Eisenhower himself adapted the \\"Great Crusade\\" line for the title of his 1948 book about the war Crusade in Europe.  Broadcast version  Recording of the order made May 28 for broadcast on D-Day Omaha beach, 8.30am June 6, 1944 Eisenhower recorded a version for radio broadcast on 28 May, at which point the invasion was intended for 31 May or 1 June (poor weather delayed the landings until June 6). The recording has been described by Timothy Rives, Deputy Director of the Dwight D. Eisenhower Presidential Library, Museum and Boyhood Home, as \\"[ringing] with confidence\\", with Eisenhower sounding \\"reminiscent of the actor Clark Gable\\". Airborne elements of the Allied Expeditionary Force landed in Normandy from around midnight on 5/6 June but official notification of the invasion was withheld until the naval landings were known to have begun. This event began with the American landings at around Central European Summer Time (CEST) and was confirmed to SHAEF headquarters by a radioman transmitting the codeword TOPFLIGHT. The British and Canadian landings began around an hour later. German radio stations in Berlin had been broadcasting the news of the invasion since CEST Eastern War Time in New York) but American media could not confirm this and warned that the messages could be false. In the United Kingdom the first official confirmation of the invasion was broadcast at around British Double Summer Time (equivalent to CEST) and Eisenhower's order, received on disc via military courier, was broadcast soon afterwards. The American broadcast of the order was made almost simultaneously at Eastern War Time, after the official SHAEF notification was made to the news corporations by Colonel Richard Ernest Dupuy. The order was followed, at Eastern War Time by recorded messages from the leaders of the governments-in-exile of Norway, Belgium and the Netherlands (in their native languages and in English) and then Eisenhower's People of Western Europe speech.  Failure message  Eisenhower's failure message Amid last minute delays caused by weather and disagreements over strategy and timing, Eisenhower wrote a short message to be issued in case the invasion was repulsed. The message was written with a pencil on a small notebook during the afternoon of June 5, Eisenhower having given the final order to proceed with the invasion that morning. He tore off the sheet and kept it in his wallet. Eisenhower rediscovered the note on July 11 and showed it to naval aide Harry C. Butcher, who persuaded Eisenhower to preserve the note for posterity; it is now in the collection of the presidential library. The note stated that \\"if any blame or fault attaches to the attempt it is mine alone\\". In his haste Eisenhower misdated the message July 5.

Between 1908 and 1923, Harth built twelve different types of gliders and laid the foundations for the development of gliding. Life Harth was the son of a head forester and attended elementary school in Bamberg, high school in Landshut, and graduated from high school in Munich. In addition to his subsequent architecture studies, he dealt with the knowledge of the first German glider pilot Otto Lilienthal and began to build a glider after his return to Bamberg. He built wings, buckled them around his body with a belt, and tested them. In 1909 while working as a government builder, he began building gliders. In 1910, Harth's first attempt to fly started on the Ludwager Kulm, near Bamberg. The summit's plateau and steep western slope favored gliding. His gliders consisted of an open or closed hull with a fixed fin. The angle of attack of the wings could be changed in the same direction or in opposite directions in order to serve as an elevator or aileron. In November, this first aircraft was severely damaged in a crash on frozen ground. Unwaveringly, Harth used knowledge from the failed attempts to build improve his gliders. The rotary wing control remained an essential feature of the his gliders. Serving as a senior construction city council member, Harth spent his free time designing and testing his flying machines. Enlisting helper Willy Messerschmitt, the 15-year-old son of a Bamberg wine merchant, who later became Harth's student. After the outbreak of the First World War, Harth was drafted into military service interrupting his flight attempts. During this time, Messerschmitt built the S5 glider according to Harth's plans. During Harth's home leave, he flew to an altitude of 20m and traveled 300m from the Heidelstein starting point. In 1916 he was transferred to Schlei√üheim, where he taught aircraft construction. Harth built the S6 glider and flew it to a landing site 15m higher than his starting point on an almost three-minute flight. His post war glider, the S7, was built in the early summer of 1919 while working at the Bayerische Flugzeugwerke (BFW - Bavarian Aircraft Works). On September 13, 1921, Harth completed a record 21 minute and 27 second glider flight from the Heidelstein in the Rh√∂n Mountains with his monoplane glider the Harth-Messerschmitt S8.

Allen took extra precautions to ensure the safety of his ship, the brig Punch, carrying prisoners, police and paying passengers. One of the paying passengers was the wife of one of the prisoners. The ship departed Port Adelaide on 13 June 1850, and arrived in good order at Hobart Town on 25 June.

The organisation started in 2014. As of May 2020, the network has over 45,000 members. The CEO since 2020 is Wakka Wakka woman, Brooke Prentis. Prentis was previously the organisation's Aboriginal Spokesperson and appears regularly on the ABC program The Drum. Common Grace focuses on justice for asylum seekers and Indigenous Australians, for ending domestic violence, and for climate justice and has run successful campaigns on these four issues. It has been called the \\"largest left-leaning and faith- based political movement in Australia.\\" Campaigns=Climate justice In late 2014, Common Grace launched a crowdfunding campaign that raised money for solar panels to be given for the Prime Minister's Sydney residence, Kirribilli House. The Australian Solar Council offered to install the panels at no cost, however the Abbott Government rejected the gift, citing the property's heritage listing and security concerns. In 2016, Common Grace launched a campaign to persuade then Deputy Prime Minister and Agriculture Minister Barnaby Joyce to stop the proposed Shenhua Watermark on the Liverpool Plains, arguing the mine risked Australia's food bowl. In 2019, the organisation supported the School strike for climate, with climate campaigner Jason John arguing students were acting on what they were learning in school. Asylum seekers Common Grace has been active in various campaigns to have refugees released from offshore detention. In 2015, the organisation's then national director, Jarrod McKenna, was one of eight people found guilty of trespassing in the office of Foreign Minister Julie Bishop after staging a peaceful sit-in protest against the detention of children on Nauru. In November 2017, Common Grace organised a day of support for the men held in detention on Manus Island. Alongside World Vision Australia, Common Grace was a driving force behind the #KidsOffNauru campaign which saw the last four children on Nauru resettled in the United States in February 2019. Indigenous Australians Common Grace advocates for justice for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. In partnership with senior Aboriginal Christian leader Aunty Jean Phillips, the organisation has revived the idea of church services to mark Australia Day. \\"#Change The Heart\\" prayer services, seeking to promote acknowledgement and understanding of Australia's First Nations Peoples, are held each year in every state and territory.

The length of the two sections combined is 3.6 km.  Etymology  The Chinese name for Calligraphy Greenway is derived from Chinese cursive script (), which emphasizes artistic expression over legibility.

The section between the museum and Provincial Highway 12 is an installation known as the \\"Evolutionary Pathway\\" (ÁîüÂëΩÊºîÂåñÊ≠•ÈÅì). The path begins with a water fountain on the museum side with water flowing along the greenway. Murals on the path depict various creatures present in Earth's evolutionary timeline. On the other side of the highway, the greenway runs past the National Hotel and Park Lane by CMP (a shopping center) before reaching a large park known as Civic Square (). Both the greenway and the park are designed by American-based engineering firm AECOM and features large stone sculptures and art displays. This section is a popular location for street performances, and Civic Square hosts the annual Taichung Jazz Festival in October.

Goudsmit-Oudkerk explained how Jewish parents were at the Hollandsche Schouwburg before they were deported. The Germans did not want to be disturbed by the sound of children, so they were brought to Betty and her colleagues, who saved around 600 children.

It was formed by the towns of Seville, Cordoba, Ecija, and Jerez, on the frontiers with the Emirate of Granada, after the accession of the nine-year old Ferdinand IV (). The town acted to form the confederation because they felt that rule of the young king left them vulnerable to raids from Granada or North Africa. It gradually became irrelevant when Ferdinand came of age, but was revived after the accession of Ferdinand's one year old son Alfonso XI (r. 1312‚Äì1350). The hermandad met in Palma del R√≠o in May 1313, raising funds for the regional defense and enacting a series of articles. After the death of the king's regents Infante Peter and Infante John at the Battle of the Vega of Granada (1319), the hermandad assumed more sovereign-like powers. In the same year, it concluded a truce with Granada and declared that it would not accept anyone as new regent if appointed without their consent, and created a budget for the regional defense. The hermanded concluded an eight-year peace treaty with Ismail I of Granada in June 1320, without prior authorization of the crown. On 13 August 1325, Alfonso XI was declared of age and assumed control of his government. He ordered the dissolution of the hermandad which he perceived as a challenge to his authority.

Sculpted out of marble by the Sicilian artist Giuseppe Valenti, the statue depicts the Queen sitting down and wearing a shawl of Maltese lace. It was installed in the square on 5 August 1891, replacing a bronze statue of Ant√≥nio Manoel de Vilhena. History The site of the statue was an empty space until the mid-19th century, when Governor John Le Marchant installed a bronze statue of Ant√≥nio Manoel de Vilhena and established a garden with orange trees in the square. The statue had been cast in 1736 and it had previously been located at Fort Manoel. After the statue of Queen Victoria was installed instead of that of Vilhena, the latter was moved to Floriana and the orange trees were removed. The square in the early 1900s, with the statue visible at its centre The statue was commissioned by public subscription to commemorate the 1887 Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria. It was sculpted in PalermoCristina Beltrami by the Sicilian artist Giuseppe Valenti, who had previously sculpted a statue of Saint Publius for the Mdina Cathedral in 1885, and it was inaugurated on 5 August 1891. In 1901, ten years after its inauguration, the statue became the focal point for the public mourning commemorations following the Queen‚Äôs death.Yale Centre for British Arts The monument probably suffered some damage from shrapnel and vibrations due to bombs exploding nearby during World War II. In the 1960s, the statue was reportedly targeted by socialists who daubed it in red paint. Despite this, there were very few calls for its removal even after Malta became an independent state in 1964 and later a republic in 1974. The square which contains the statue is now officially known as Misraƒß ir-Repubblika (Republic Square), but it is still commonly referred to as Pjazza Reƒ°ina (Queen's Square) after the statue. The statue deteriorated over the years due to weather conditions and feral pigeons which are common in the area. By the early 21st century, parts of the pedestal were chipped, while the fingers of the left hand and parts of the coronet and sceptre were missing. The inscriptions on the pedestal had also eroded. The monument was cleaned and restored in 2011, with conservation work being carried out by Heritage ResCo. The restoration was sponsored by M. Demajo Group and Din l-Art ƒ¶elwa, while the Ministry of Resources and Rural Affairs provided some assistance. In June 2020, there were some calls for the statue's removal in the wake of the removal of many statues in the United States and elsewhere during the George Floyd protests. Former Valletta 2018 artistic director Mario Azzopardi called the statue a \\"colonial obscenity\\" and called for its removal, while chairman of the Malta Book Council Mark Camilleri called for its relocation and replacement with a monument to a prominent Maltese intellectual. There are also those who are opposed to the statue's removal, including Fondazzjoni Wirt Artna founder Mario Farrugia and culture minister Jos√© Herrera. The latter stated that removal of monuments of British colonial rule in Malta would be \\"ridiculous\\" and that it would not change the fact that the islands were under foreign rule for much of their history. Description The statue and its pedestal in 2014 The statue depicts Queen Victoria wearing a shawl of Maltese lace,, in reference to the fact that she had ordered \\"eight dozen pairs long and eight dozen pairs short mitts, besides a scarf\\" of Malta lace.

Disc golf in Finland is governed by the Finnish Disc Golf Association (FDGA, ). Its mission is to promote the sport and to \\"organize disc golf activities in Finland together with its approximately 150 member organizations.\\"  Popularity  Disc golf is the fastest growing sport in Finland. According to the Finnish Research Institute for Olympic Sports (KIHU), it is more popular among Finns than ball golf, volleyball, basketball and tennis. The country is frequently called a model country for disc golf, a Mecca, and a hot bed. In June 2020, there were 2,815 active PDGA members and 2,985 expired memberships, an increase from June 2015, when there were 1,434 and 686, respectively. The popularity of disc golf in Finland has been variously attributed to Jussi Meresmaa‚Äôs marketing know-how, the fact that disc golf is taught in gym class curriculums, and that municipalities build courses to attract new taxpayers. Finland's proximity to other disc golf hubs around the Baltic Sea, namely Estonia and Sweden, is also a factor. ;Number of PDGA members at Year-End. ;Number of Courses at Year-End. ;Number of Events at Year-End.  Courses  A disc golf basket in the snow at the Meri-Toppila course in Oulu Approximately 7% of the world's disc golf courses are located in Finland. Some of the most notable ones include Puijo DGP in Kuopio, Kaatis in Vihti, Pikkarala Frisbeegolf in Oulu. In 2019, Helsinki topped UDisc's list of Top 5 Disc Golf Cities outside the United States. Most courses in Finland are located in public parks or sporting areas and can be played for free. Commercial courses are generally found around sports complexes, ski resorts, spas and camping areas.  Market  Finland is the disc golf market share leader in Europe. In 2014, Spin18 estimated the total value of the European disc golf industry to 16 million Euros, with Finland accounting for more than half of it, at around 9 million Euros. Budget Sport, a large Finnish sports equipment retailer, sponsored the 2015 European Open and features disc golf equipment prominently in its retail stores.  Manufacturers  As a country, Finland has the second largest number of disc golf equipment manufacturers, second only to the United States. Major Finnish disc brands include Discmania, founded by Jussi Meresmaa in Tampere, Finland, Westside Discs, which is associated with Dynamic Discs and Latitude 64Àö, Viking, Obsidian, and Prodiscus, which also manufacturers discs for Missouri- based Full Turn and Australian Fourth Circle Discs.  Tourism  Disc golfers at the now-defunct Yyteri beach course at sunset in Pori Disc golf courses are marketed by Finnish municipalities and on tourism board websites.  √Öland Islands  In May 2020, Mats Adamczak, √Öland‚Äôs Chairman for the Federation of Small Businesses, approached DiscGolfPark with the ambitious project of turning the √Öland Islands into a \\"disc golf island\\" by building 16 new courses by the end of the summer, one for each municipality in the autonomous region. At the time of the press release, there were only two courses on √Öland.  Mass media  Coverage of disc golf tournaments is mainstream in Finland. It is not uncommon for major tournaments and local competitions to get coverage.  Television  Disc golf gets frequent coverage on national television since the 2005 European Championships. In 2013, the final round of the European Open aired for 90 minutes nationwide on YLE.

On February 7, 2017, a lawyer for Nikulin claimed that in mid-November 2016, as well as earlier that day, an FBI agent had visited Nikulin in Pankr√°c Prison and had offered him cash, an apartment, U.S. citizenship, as well as all cyber charges against him dropped, if he would agree to confess to participating in the 2016 Democratic National Committee email leak. In late March 2018, Paul Ryan visited the Czech capital, where he urged authorities to grant Nikulin's extradition to the U.S. Extradition On March 30, 2018, Nikulin was extradited to the U.S., where he plead not guilty to the charges against him. Conviction On July 10, 2020, Nikulin was convicted by a jury in a United States District Court in San Francisco on all but one of the counts. Nikulin‚Äôs sentencing hearing is scheduled for September 29, 2020, before Judge Alsup. Sentencing On September 29, 2020, Nikulin was sentenced to 88 months in prison. Controversy Bryan Paarmaan, who was the FBI Deputy Assistant Director in the International Operations Division, admitted to leaking details of Nikulin's indictment to Los Angeles Times reporter, Del Quentin Wilber, two days before the indictment was unsealed.

Cook died in Vietnam in 1968. African Americans played a prominent role in the Vietnam War. The Vietnam War was the first American war in which Black and White troops were not formally segregated, though de facto segregation still occurred.  Background  African Americans have always been involved in United States military service since its inception despite official policies of racial segregation and discrimination. In 1948 President Harry S. Truman abolished discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion or national origin. By 1953, the final black only unit was abolished. Draft Capt. William T. Watson, aids injured dog. Black Americans were more likely to be drafted than White Americans. At the time, the Vietnam War saw the highest proportion of African-Americans soldiers. Though comprising 11% of US population in 1967, African Americans were 16.3% of all draftees. The majority of African Americans who were drafted were not conscripted, with 70% of Black draftees rejected from the Army. In 1967, only 29% of African American subjects were eligible for conscription, compared to 63% of white subjects. That same year the armed services drafted 64% of the eligible African American subjects in comparison to the 31% of eligible white subjects drafted. Project 100,000, which helped dramatically increase US troop presence in Vietnam from 23,300 in 1965 to 465,600 two years later, sharply increased the number of African American troops drafted. By lowering the education standards of the draft, an estimated 40% of the 246,000 draftees of Project 100,000 were Black. A total of 300,000 African-Americans served in Vietnam. According to Daniel Lucks the reason behind the high turnout was the pay, which for many, was more than they had ever made in their lives, and that young African Americans \\"perceived military service as a vocational opportunity, and they had the additional incentive to enlist to prove on the battlefield that they were worthy of their newly acquired civil rights.\\" Some activists in the US speculated that the uneven application of the draft was a method of Black genocide. From the years, 1966 to 1969, opinion of the draft grew increasingly negative. A 1966 poll from Newsweek found that 25% of African Americans thought of the laws as unfair. A similar poll in 1969 saw the number rise to 47%. Black people were starkly under- represented on draft boards in this era, with none on the draft boards of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, or Arkansas. In Louisiana, Jack Helms, a Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan, served on the draft board from 1957 until 1966. In 1966, 1.3% of the US draft board members were African American with only Delaware having a proportionate number of African American board members to the African American population. In 1967, the NAACP Legal Defense Fund and the American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit in South Carolina demanding that South Carolina halt the drafting of African Americans on the grounds of their absence on the state‚Äôs draft boards. By 1970, the number of African Americans on the draft boards grew from 230 to 1,265, though this still only represented 6.6% of all draft board members. Service Members of the 2nd Platoon, Company A, 1st Battalion, 50th Infantry (Mechanized), set up an M-60 machine gun position during a search and clear mission Company D, 1st Military Police Battalion Marines keep watch on the Cam Le Bridge Across all branches of the military, African Americans composed 11% of all troops. However, a disproportionate number were made officers, with only 5% of Army officers African American, and 2% across all branches. In 1968, out of the 400,000 officers, there were only 8325 African American officers. Out of the 1342 admirals and generals, there were only 2 African Americans generals ‚Äì Lieutenant General Benjamin O. Davis and Brigadier General Frederic E. Davidson ‚Äì and no African-American admirals. African American troops were more likely to be assigned to combat units: 23% of such troops in Vietnam were African Americans. In some airborne units African Americans composed 45-60% of troops. Racism against African Americans was particularly pronounced in the Navy. Only 5% of sailors were Black in 1971, with less than 1% of Navy officers African American. From 1966 to 1967, the reenlistment rate for African Americans was 50%, twice what it was for white soldiers. It would rise to 66.5% in 1967 but then drop to 31.7% in 1968. Discrimination Overt racism was typical in American bases in Vietnam. Although initially uncommon by the start of the war, after the Assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., they increased at a higher rate. Following the assassination, some White troops at Cam Ranh Base wore Ku Klux Klan robes and paraded around the base. At least three instances of cross burning were confirmed to have happened. Da Nang Air Base flew the Confederate flag for three days in response. In addition to being used in response to King's murder, Confederate flags and icons were commonly painted on jeeps, tanks, and helicopters; bathroom graffiti proclaimed that African Americans, not the Vietnamese, were the real enemy. Black troops were discouraged from taking pride in Black identity, with one troop ordered to remove a \\"Black is beautiful\\" poster from his locker. Following complaints from African American soldiers, Confederate flags were briefly banned but soon allowed after resistance from Southern politicians objected. Black identity publications and speeches were restricted, with some commanders banning recordings of speeches by Malcolm X or the newspaper The Black Panther. Despite segregation being abolished in the military, it still affected troops. According to journalists Wallace Terry and Zalin Grant by 1968, racial incidents in Danang, Cam Ranh Bay, Dong Tam, Saigon, and Bien Hoa happened on an \\"almost daily basis\\" and had become \\"commonplace\\". Similar reports came from official channels with there being at least 33 incidents of racial violence in the two months between December 1969 and January 1970. In 1970 there were 1,060 reported cases of violent racial conflict. Racial incidents also affected the navy and air force. Following King's death race riots and conflicts occurred at Long Binh jail and Camp Lejuene. The former was the worst race riot in the U.S. army's history and the latter garnered national attention due to 44 African-American soldiers being arrested but no white soldiers. It also inspired an investigation and creation of a committee to study racial bias and African American militancy in the armed forces. Grant once claimed that the \\"biggest threat\\" to the U.S. military was \\"race riots, not the Vietcong.\\" Many African American soldiers claimed that they were unfairly targeted for punishment, including being denied for promotion and disproportionately assigned menial tasks. A 1970 Army study of the 197th Infantry Brigade reported that African Americans soldiers frequently complained that ‚Äúwhite NCOs always put black soldiers on the dirtiest details.‚Äù L. Howard Bennett, the deputy assistant secretary of defense for civil rights in the Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon administrations noted a similar occurrence, that African Americans soldiers would \\"complained that they are discriminated against in promotions ... that they will stay in grade too long, that they will train and teach whites who come in and pretty soon their trainees pass them by and get the promotion.\\" These complaints were rarely taken serious. From 1968 to 1969 only 10 out of 534 were deemed legitimate. During this time period (1966‚Äì1969) a study commissioned by the Army found that, commanders had failed to report 423 allegations of racial discrimination. Black culture and norms were also not initially acknowledged on bases. Black troops did not have access to Black haircare products, soul music tapes, nor books or magazines about Black culture and history. Instead, the Armed Forces Radio Network mostly played country music. Military barbers frequently had no experience cutting Black hair, and received no formal training on how to do so. The Armed Forces took some action to make Black troops feel more included, including adding more diverse music to club jukeboxes, hiring Black bands and dancers for events, and bringing over Black entertainers to perform, such as James Brown, Miss Black America, and Miss Black Utah. Base exchanges began to stock Black haircare products and garments like dashikis, while books about Black culture and history were added to base libraries. By 1973, military barbers had been trained on how to cut Black hair. Mandated race relations training was introduced and soldiers were encouraged to be more accepting. Ultimately, many of these changes were made towards the end of the war when personnel had been greatly reduced, meaning that a majority of Black troops who served during the Vietnam War did not benefit from these reforms. Internal resistance White soldier helps black soldier climb ravine. Racial tensions created internal divisions, causing Black soldiers to sometimes refuse to fight. One such incident near the A S·∫ßu Valley caused fifteen Black soldiers to refuse to report for combat patrol the following day. Almost 200 Black troops who were imprisoned at Long B√¨nh Jail staged a work strike for more than a month following a riot. In another incident, a race riot occurred on the USS Kitty Hawk, after the ship was forced to cancel its trip home and return to Vietnam. Black and White sailors attacked each other with chains and pipes, resulting in the arrest of twenty-five Black sailors, though no White ones. On the USS Constellation, Black sailors organized to investigate the application of non-judicial punishment among White and Black sailors. Six of the organizers were given less-than-honorable discharges, with rumors that up to 200 Black sailors would receive the same punishment. On November 3, 1972, about 100 Black sailors and a few White sailors staged a sit-in protest on the ship's deck. Many of the dissidents were ultimately reassigned from the ship, with a few discharged. Several Black troops deserted their posts. A few were smuggled through the USSR into Sweden, while up to 100 lived in a region of Saigon known as Soul Alley. Solidarity Black identity movements within Vietnam War troops grew over time, with Black troops drafted from 1967 - 1970 calling themselves \\"Bloods\\". Bloods distinguished themselves by wearing black gloves and amulets, as well as bracelets made out of boot laces. Dap handshakes, or complex ritualized handshakes, originated among Black troops of the Vietnam War. The dap varied among units. Black troops and officers acknowledged each other in public with a Black Power salute, which is raising a fist. By 1969 a \\"new African American\\" soldier had arisen, catergorized by \\"a new sense of African American pride and purpose.\\" The Black Liberation Front of the Armed Forces was a Black solidarity group formed by Eddie Burney. In 1971, Burney and other Black troops stationed in Vietnam held a demonstration in response to King's assassination. Within the Air Force, at least twenty-five Black solidarity groups had formed by 1970, many of which were based in the US. Another group formed on the USS Constellation, known as The Black Fraction. Other groups that formed included Minority Servicemen‚Äôs Association, the Concerned Veterans Association, Black Brothers United, the Zulu 1200s, the Black Liberation Front of the Armed Forces, Blacks In Action, the Unsatisfied Black Soldier, the Ju Jus, and the Mau Maus.  Friendly white and black relations  Black and white Marines play with children from an orphanage. During the Vietnam War, many black and white soldiers formed close friendships. NBC journalist Frank McGee, who spent nearly a month living with soldiers of the 101st Airborne Division recalled that \\"Nowhere in America have I seen Negroes and whites as free, open and uninhibited with their associations. I saw no eyes clouded with resentment.\\" African American Sergeant Lewis B. Larry shared similar sentiments stating that \\"There‚Äôs no racial barrier of any sort here\\". Many fellow African American soldiers echoed McGee's beliefs; in 1989 Wallace Terry stated that \\"the front lines of Vietnam\\" was the only place where Martin Luther King Jr's dream of \\"sons of former slaves and sons of slave owners [sitting] at the same table [came true]\\". He did however acknowledge beforehand that \\"[there is] another war being fought in Vietnam ‚Äî between black and white Americans.\\" Punishment and casualties Two Marines help severely wounded Marine. African American troops were punished more harshly and more frequently than White troops. A Defense Department study released in 1972 found that Black troops received 34.3% of court-martials, 25.5% of nonjudicial punishments, and comprised 58% of prisoners at Long B√¨nh Jail, a military prison. It further remarked, \\"No command or installation...is entirely free from the effects of systematic discrimination against minority servicemen.\\" Black troops were also almost twice as likely as White troops to receive a punitive discharge. In 1972, African-Americans received more than one-fifth of the bad-conduct discharges and nearly one-third of the dishonorable discharges. In the Vietnam War, African American troops initially had a much higher casualty rate than other ethnicities, though this declined somewhat throughout the course of the conflict. In 1965, nearly a quarter of troop casualties were African American. By 1967, it had fallen to 12.7%. In total, 7,243 African Americans died during the Vietnam War, representing 12.4% of total casualties. The refusal, by some southern communities, to bury dead African American soldiers in unsegregated cemeteries was met with outrage by African American communities.  Views on the war  While at the start of the war the vast majority of African American soldiers \\"believed America was protecting the sovereignty of the democratically constituted government in South Vietnam and halting the spread of communism in Southeast Asia\\" King's opposition to the Vietnam War and death saw disillusionment and anti-war rhetoric grow among African American soldiers. The Project 100,000 and racism within the military also furthered the anger of African American soldiers. By the summer of 1968, correspondent Deckle McLean reported that few African- American soldiers supported the war. After the war In the mid-1980s, African American veterans of the Vietnam War were twice as likely as White veterans to experience posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), at a prevalence of 40%. Reasons for the disparity in PTSD prevalence could include social and racial discord during the war, institutional racism within the military, and racism after the war. Black troops were also more likely than White troops to relate to the Vietnamese people as an impoverished, non-white group. Additionally, Black troops were less likely to rationalize brutal violence employed against the Vietnamese, and were significantly more disturbed by it than White troops. It has been speculated that White troops were more able to dehumanize the Vietnamese than Black troops. According to psychologists Richard Strayer and Lewis Ellenhorn, African American veterans struggled more than other veterans with a return to civilian life and unemployment on the basis of their race. Black veterans were much less likely to write memoirs about their experiences. A 1997 paper noted that, of almost 400 such memoirs by participants in the Vietnam War, only seven were by African American veterans (less than 2%): *GI Diary by David Parks (1968) *The Courageous and the Proud by Samuel Vance (1970) *Memphis-Nam-Sweden: The Autobiography of a Black American Exile by Terry Whitmore (1971) *Just Before the Dawn: A Doctor's Experiences in Vietnam by Fenton Williams (1971) *A Hero's Welcome: The Conscience of Sergeant James Daly versus the United States Army by James A. Daly (1975) *Yet Another Voice by Norman A. McDaniel (1975) *Thoughts about the Vietnam War by Eddie Wright (1984) Both James A. Daly and Norman A. McDaniel were prisoners of war, publishing their respective memoirs within two years of their releases. Of Daly and Whitmore's respective works, American literature scholar Jeff Loeb noted: According to Daniel Lucks, African American soldiers hold a \\"nightmarish remembrance of the war.\\" New York Times correspondent Thomas A. Jackson reported that ‚ÄúBitterness and disappointment in America [were] typical of Negro veterans\\". A 1981 survey by the House Committee on Veterans Affairs found that only 20% of African Americans thought of their time as positive. After the Vietnam War, the number of African American officers in key positions throughout the armed forces rose.  Awards and recognition  It has been investigated whether or not Black troops are less likely to be nominated for a Medal of Honor than White troops; out of 3,500 recipients, only 92 have been Black men. As of 2019, the most recent Black Medal of Honor recipient from the Vietnam War was John L. Canley, who received his Medal in 2018. Twenty-two Black men have received the Medal of Honor for actions undertaken during the Vietnam War: * Webster Anderson * Eugene Ashley Jr., Killed in Action * William Maud Bryant, Killed in Action * Lawrence Joel * Dwight H.

Life = Childhood and youth  Ernst Friedrich was born in Breslau (now Wroc≈Çaw, Poland) as the 13th child of a cleaning lady and a saddler. After finishing elementary school, he started an apprenticeship as a bookprinter in 1908. Soon after, he quit the apprenticeship and started studying acting. He earned money by working in a factory. He was one of the founders of the Breslau Association for Youth Workers.Ulrich Klemm: Ernst Friedrich. In: Hans J√ºrgen Degen (Hg.): Lexikon der Anarchie. Verlag Schwarzer Nachtschatten, B√∂sdorf/Pl√∂n 1993. In 1911, he became a member of the Social Democratic Party of Germany. From 1912 until 1914 he travelled in Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Switzerland. In 1914, he made his acting debut in his hometown and had a performance at the royal theater in Potsdam.  World War I  He was drafted in World War I and decided to become a conscientious objector.B√©r√©nice Zunino: Pacifisme et violence.

He was convicted of sabotage of military activities and imprisoned in Potsdam in 1917.Michael Bienert, Elke Linda Buchholz: Die Zwanziger Jahre in Berlin. Ein Wegweiser durch die Stadt.

At the end of 1918 he came free due to the German Revolution of 1918‚Äì1919.  Weimar Republic  Friedrich was actively involved in the Spartacist uprising. After the end of the war, he was a member of the youth organisation Freie sozialistische Jugend by Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg. After its dissolution in 1920, he founded his own anarchist youth group \\"Freie Jugend\\" in Berlin. The group was also founded in Preu√üen, Sachsen, Th√ºringen, Rheinland, Westfalen as well as in Austria an Switzerland. The magazine Freie Jugend connected the different groups and was published by Friedrich until 1926. From 1923 on, the group fusioned with the Syndikalistisch-Anarchistische Jugend Deutschlands (SAJD), an anarcho-syndicalist youth movement that promoted antimilitarism. In between the two World Wars, he was an antimilitarist activist. Among other activities, he was a speaker at an anti- war demonstration in front of Berlin Cathedral on 31 July 1921 that had over 100,000 participants. His flat in Friedrichshain became a meeting place and a commune for young anarchists. In 1925, he founded the Anti-Kriegs-Museum (Anti-War Museum) in Berlin, because he wanted to create a space for peace education. His most famous book Krieg dem Kriege (\\"War against War\\"), which was published in 1924, was a direct result of his research for the museum. It shows the atrocities of war in pictures. Berlin-Mitte (Parochialstr. 1‚Äì3) Later he published the weekly magazine \\"Die schwarze Fahne\\" (\\"The Black Flag\\") which had a circulation of up to 40,000 copies. Friedrich was close friends with Henry Jacoby and Erich M√ºhsam. Jacoby called him in retrospect an \\"apostle of a radical youth movement, prophet of an anti-hierarchical socialism [and] aggressive antimilitarist\\". As editor of the magazine \\"Freie Jugend\\" he dedicated a number of the magazine in 1924 to the political prisoners of the Weimar Republic, among them Erich M√ºhsam. His publications were often banned or confiscated and Friedrich was regularly charged with different offences. The lawyer Hans Litten defended him on several occasions. On 14 November 1930, he was sentenced to one year in jail due to his political activities. He was involved in the distribution of antimilitarist texts among police and military.  Third Reich and World War II  He was a victim of Nazi terror already before Hitler's rise to power in 1933. He was the victim of violent assaults by the Sturmabteilung regularly and the windows of his museum were destroyed so often that he could not find insurance for it anymore. After the Reichstag fire he was arrested on 28 February 1933. The museum was demolished by the Nazis and turned into a Sturmabteilung facility. After his release he escaped to other European countries in December 1933. For some time he was able to hide in the Quaker project Rest Home.Claus Bernet: Neues zum ‚ÄûRest-Home‚Äú: Hilfe f√ºr Opfer der NS-Diktatur 1933‚Äì1939 in Deutschland, abgerufen am 17. Dezember 2016. In 1936, he opened a new museum in Brussels, which was again destroyed after the German invasion of Belgium in 1940. Ernst Friedrich escaped with his son, also called Ernst, to France. There he was arrested by the Vichy regime and became a prisoner in the St. Cyprien camp, and afterwards in the Gurs internment camp.Julian Nordhues: Der Anarchist und Antimilitarist Ernst Friedrich, abgerufen am 17. Dezember 2016. After 18 months, he was able to escape. In 1943, he was discovered by the Gestapo. He escaped once more and became a member of the French Resistance. Close to the village Barre-des-C√©vennes in the D√©partement Loz√®re he ran the farm \\"La Castelle\\" together with his second wife Marthe Saint-Pierre. Friedrich fought in the liberation of N√Æmes and Al√®s. He was wounded twice. He saved about 70 children of a Jewish children's home from being deported.L‚Äô√Æle de la paix d‚ÄôErnst Friedrich, 7. Mai 2009, abgerufen am 17. Dezember 2016.  After World War II  After the war, Friedrich became a member of the French Socialist Party. Since 1947, he was working on building up a new anti-war museum in Paris. He received a grant of 1,000 dollars from an international foundation. He bought a boat and turned it into the peace boat Arche de No√© (\\"Noah's Ark\\"). He parked it at the Seine island at Villeneuve-la-Garenne. He published three numbers of the magazine Bordbrief from 1950 until 1953. In 1954 he received compensation money for losing his property and for his wounds due to the Third Reich. With this money, he bought 3.000 m¬≤ of forest on a Seine island close to Le Perreux-sur-Marne. There he built an international youth center in 1954. From 1961 on, it was a youth center for working youth. Towards the end of his life he was suffering from severe depression.Reinhard M√ºller: Ein Portrait des Anarchisten und Widerstandsk√§mpfers Ernst Friedrich. In: Friedolins Befreiung.

Capua played high school basketball for Lew Wallace High School in Gary, Indiana. Though he was named all-state in his senior year, he was not recruited by nearby Big Ten Conference schools due to his size - only at the time (he would later grow to ). Lew Wallace and Wyoming alum Milo Komenich facilitated suggested his move to his college alma mater to play for his former coach Everett Shelton. As the team's point guard, Capua led the Cowboys' fast break and as a junior he came into his own as a scorer, ending the season averaging 14.2 points per game and making the All-Skyline Conference first team. As a senior in the 1955‚Äì56 season, Capua became one of the top scorers in the Skyline Conference and the nation at 24.5 points per game. Despite a disappointing 7‚Äì19 overall season for the Cowboys, Capua set several school and conference records, including a then-records for most points in a game (51) and season (637). At the close of the season, Capua was again named first-team all-conference and was additionally named the Skyline Conference Player of the Year. Nationally, he was named a third-team All-American by the Newspaper Enterprise Association (NEA) and was named to the national \\"Small-America\\" team by the United Press International (UPI) for the top players or shorter. Coach Shelton would describe Capua one of his best all-time players and compared him favorably to Hall of Fame guard Ken Sailors. In 2001 he was inducted into the University of Wyoming Athletic Hall of Fame. Following the close of his college career, Capua was not drafted in the 1956 NBA draft. He instead went on to play in the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) for the Denver-Chicago Truckers.

A total of 999 people were nominated, as a result of which 267 became deputies. Of the 266 deputies supported by the United Democrats project, 177 were nominated by the Yabloko party, making the party the second in the city in terms of the number of deputy mandates. Commenting on the election results for the party, leader Grigory Yavlinsky called Katz ‚Äúan effective ally‚Äù and noted the youth‚Äôs interest in the elections. Later, in January 2018, Dmitry Gudkov broke off cooperation with Katz due to disagreements regarding the Yabloko part. In 2019, Maxim Katz participated in the leadership of election campaigns in the Moscow City Duma of Daria Besedina and Anastasia Bryukhanova, employees of City projects. Daria Besedina was registered, her team raised more than 18 million rubles through fundraising, Daria was supported by a \\"Smart Voting\\" of Alexei Navalny and was able to win the election, becoming a deputy of the Moscow City Duma.  Participation in the Yabloko Party  On September 12, 2016, Katz announced his intention to join the Yabloko party. In a video published on this topic, Katz said that his statement was accepted by Grigory Yavlinsky, and urged his supporters to join the Yabloko party and announced his intention to be elected in the future to the regional council of the branch and to the post of chairman of the Moscow branch of Yabloko. Later in September 2016, Maxim Katz was accepted into the party at a meeting of the Federal Bureau. After the appeal of Maxim Katz, at least 328 people submitted applications for joining the party. These actions provoked a negative reaction from the current chairman of the Moscow branch of the party, Sergei Mitrokhin, who called what was happening \\"a raider seizure.\\" As a result, more than 110 people were denied admission to the party because of ‚Äúpolitical independence‚Äù. Later, these people were accepted into the party by the federal bureau, and Sergei Mitrokhin was removed from the post of chairman of the Moscow branch. On December 1, 2018, Katz was elected chairman of the local branch of the Yabloko party in the North-Western District of Moscow. In 2019, he headed the headquarters of Yabloko in the elections in St. Petersburg. As a result of the campaign, 99 representatives of the party became municipal deputies (previously the party had 0 municipal deputies in St. Petersburg). On February 11, 2020, information appeared about the dissatisfaction of Maxim Katz‚Äôs supporters with the procedures adopted by the Yabloko party for the election of the party‚Äôs governing bodies, as well as about the possible soon expulsion of Katz from the Yabloko party. Further, this information was refuted by the head of the Moscow branch of the Yabloko Sergey Ivanenko.

Early life  Philip Buston was born in 1853 in Twyford, Hampshire, to the Reverend Roger Buston and his wife Anne Mary Buston. He lived his childhood years in Vicarage House, Twyford with his parents and siblings.  Military service  Buston was temporarily commissioned as a Lieutenant , and on 28 September 1875 it was declared that his Commission among others would be made permanent, with pay backdated to the aforementioned date. The India Office and Burma Office List of 1877 accordingly has him listed as a Lieutenant attached to the Sappers and Miners of the Royal Engineers from 12 September 1872.  Second Anglo-Afghan War  He took part in the Second Anglo-Afghan War as part of the 7th Company of Sappers and Miners under the command of then-Brigadier General Thomas Durand Baker, and on 4 May 1880 he was mentioned in Despatches by then-Lieutenant-General Sir Frederick Roberts, on the advisement of Brigadier-General Baker. As of 12 September 1884 Buston was promoted to Captain. On 10 April 1889 he was promoted to Brevet Major, and then to full Major rank on 26 January 1892.  Hazara Expedition  Buston was a part of the Hazara Expedition of 1891, and is mentioned again in Despatches written on 28 August 1891 by then-Major- General William Elles in regards to the operations of the Hazara Field Force, this time in some more detail, and with heavy praise - \\"The pontoon section of the Bengal Sappers and Miners was commanded by Major P. T. Buston, Royal Engineers, and it was entirely due to this officer's indomitable energy and perseverance that the standing and flying bridges were established exactly when required. It was no light task to bring up the heavy boats from Attock through shallows and over rapids, dangerous in many places, with very little loss of material and no loss of life, and his successful accomplishment of the task is worthy of all praise. The movements and communications of the force were entirely dependent on its constructive capacity in roadmaking.\\". On 1 October 1899 Buston was further promoted to Lieutenant Colonel.  Second Boer War  In a letter dated 16 April 1901, Buston was once again mentioned in Despatches for a second time by the now Earl Roberts for meritorious service, and was further awarded the Distinguished Service Order on 19 April 1901. Following the Second Boer War, Buston was at some point between 1901 and 1904 made Brevet Colonel, and was placed on to half pay on 20 September 1904 following five years service as a regimental Lieutenant Colonel. This did not last long, however, as on 21 August 1905 Buston was brought off half pay, made a Chief Engineer at Aldershot Command and granted the full rank of Colonel in the Army. Further honours were given on 29 June 1906, when Buston was made a Companion of the Order of the Bath, and on 5 October 1907, when he was made a temporary Brigadier-General for as long as he held the position of Chief Engineer. This position and temporary rank lasted until 21 August 1909, after which he was put on to the half-pay list, and then on to the retired pay list on 16 February 1910.  Retired life  Two years after he retired, Buston was given an honourary promotion restoring his previously temporary rank of Brigadier General. In 1915, during the First World War, Buston was involved in the opening and running of a Voluntary Aid Detachment hospital at Broughall Cottage, Whitchurch, and is mentioned by the War Office on 12 February 1918 in the London Gazette as having provided \\"very valuable\\" services during the course of the war. Buston died on 21 June 1938, having resided at Tilstock Lodge, Tilstock, Whitchurch for his final years.

For example, a serge stands as a pole at the entrance to a yurt or at the gate of a house to indicate that as long as the serge is there, the family will live there. Traditionally, a serge cannot be destroyed, but can only decay. The serge is connected to the horse cult, as both the hosts and the guests tied their horses to it. It is also a symbol of the world tree that unites the three worlds: Three horizontal grooves are cut on the pole, the upper one intended to bind the horses of the heavenly inhabitants of the upper world, the middle one intended for the horses of men, and the lower one for the horses of the underworld. In the past, serges were placed at every yurt and also at the initiation of the shaman (the shanar-rite). At the cemeteries of the shamans very high serges were placed for the unification of gods and spirits. Serges in the form of stone obelisks were also placed on these cemeteries (deer stones).

Billy Meeske (b. 1891) was an Australian professional wrestler who was three-time Australian Heavyweight Champion and one time Pacific Coast Light Heavyweight Champion. He was an active professional wrestler from 1922 to 1938,Billy Meeske at wrestlingdata.com and he was credited as being a major influence in re-establishing professional wrestling in Australia following the First World War. During his professional wrestling career he also performed as part of vaudeville acts demonstrating feats of strength, such as supporting the weight of five men, feats of agility, and Russian dancing. While he achieved his greatest fame in professional wrestling he was also an all-round sportsman competing in many sports at the amateur and professional levels, and served in the Australian Imperial Force during the First World War with the rank of Sergeant.William Meeske at Discovering ANZACS website Biography=Early life Meeske was born in South Melbourne, Victoria,William Meeske at Discovering ANZACS website to Australian born parents and he would later claim to be 'purebred' Australian with the exception of one of his grandfather's grandfathers being Russian. He achieved renown as an all-round athlete in his youth, particularly for cycling, wrestling, heavyweight lifting, swimming, gymnastics, and as a motorcyclist. In 1903 he enrolled in the wrestling school of Weber and Rice. In 1907 he began cycling professionally, however in 1910 he decided he wished to compete in amateur events and was required to stand down from athletic competitions for one year in order to qualify for them. He began competing in amateur wrestling after his hiatus and became the Australian middleweight champion, holding the title from 1912 to 1914. He returned to professionalism in 1915 by becoming a professional wrestler and in April he wrestled as part of an athletic program during an event to raise money for Belgium in Melbourne, and in October he wrestled on a Police Charity Carnival program. Sgt. Meeske in his military uniform. Military service In November 1915 he enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force due to the First World War. At the time of his enlistment he was married to May J. Meeske.William Meeske at Discovering ANZACS website During his training he was appointed physical instructor to the Royal Park Camp and began training for boxing. He showed an aptitude for boxing and in July 1916 he sparred with twenty men in one evening at the Royal Park Camp. He was valued for his ability as a physical trainer and as such his superiors were reluctant to deploy him however he wished to serve at the front and was finally deployed with the Railway Unit in early 1917. He wrestled a Russian soldier during the voyage to the front, and while boxing competitions took place during the voyage Meeske was banned from participating due to his skill. As of November 1917 he was serving as a sapper in Belgium, and boxed against fellow soldiers while on active service there. As of 1918 he was in France and serving on the physical training staff of a convalescent camp, and wrestled in a competition between Australian, American, Canadian, English, and Belgian soldiers in 1918, and judged a boxing competition in 1919. During his time deployed in France he had eighteen boxing matches winning seventeen and drawing one and defeated former French wrestling champion M. Pernin in a wrestling match. First reign as Heavyweight Champion of Australia Meeske was back in Australia in 1920 and became an instructor at the Victorian Railways Institute and at some point became physical instructor for the Essendon Football Club. In February he directed an athletic program during which he demonstrated Russian Dance, Ju-Jitsu, and weight lifting. In April he issued a challenge wagering twenty pounds that no light heavyweight wrestler in Australia could beat him in a catch-as-catch-can style best of three falls match. As of September 1920 it was being suggested that he may have a superior physique to respected wrestler Clarence Weber, and he challenged Weber to put the heavy-weight championship on the line, but later learnt that Weber had officially retired in 1913 and as such claimed to be the Australian heavyweight champion and stated that he was willing to defend the title against any challenger including Weber. Weber declined to wrestle Meeske unless he was paid one hundred pounds, and in 1921 it was suggested that there were no worthy opponents for Meeske in Australia. In August 1921 he wrestled his first match after the war defeating Billy Tonkin. In January 1922 Meeske had a Ju-Jitsu match against Billy McGarvey. Professional wrestling was described as having almost lapsed out of existence in Australia as of 1922, and in late January the company Country Stadiums Ltd. moved to reinvigorate the sport organizing for Meeske to wrestle Billy Kopsch under their auspices in March. Victorian wrestler, Bert Potts, challenged Meeske for the Australian championship before Meeske had wrestled Kopsch. As the scheduled date approached Meeske delayed the match by a fortnight, but by April it had still not taken place, with Kopsch stating he had not heard any news regarding it. As of July 1922 Meeske was still claiming the heavyweight championship and giving wrestling demonstrations with Billy Tonkin, and in July he issued a challenge claiming he was able to throw any twelve wrestlers in Australia within an hour. Billy Meeske demonstrating a feat of strength, 1923 In August 1922 a meeting of all professional wrestlers in Victoria was held to reinvigorate the sport and resolve the issue of scheduled matches falling through. At the meeting it was decided that the two wrestlers with the best claim to the heavyweight championship of Australia were Joe Bailey and Meeske and a match was scheduled. In September 1922 to promote the match Meeske antagonized Bailey by having ten pounds delivered to him via the newspaper the Sporting Globe as a wager and suggesting that Bailey may not show due to cowardice. He later sent an additional fifteen pounds to Bailey saying he would wrestle him at any time and any location with ten days notice. Meeske finally wrestled for the heavyweight championship against Bailey on November 22 at Melbourne Stadium, defeating him and becoming the recognized heavyweight champion of Australia. After his victory he went on holiday to Gippsland Lakes. In January 1923 Meeske agreed to face Dave Smith for the heavyweight title in February, and announced that he would defend the title against Billy Kopsch if he defeated Smith ahead of the match. He defeated Smith with the victory being described as easy, and decisive with the match lasting just three minutes. Meeske's manager demanded that Kopsch wager twenty-five pounds ahead of their match, accusing him of not drawing large enough crowds to his matches, and Meeske instead wrestled and defeated Scotsman Jim McMurdo in April 1923. Another notable event in April was that Meeske joined the coaching staff of the South Melbourne Football Club. In May, 1923, Kopsch challenged Meeske again, and they finally wrestled on May 31 with Meeske winning after Kopsche sustained a shoulder injury he claimed seriously handicapped him. They wrestled a second time in June with Meeske winning again. After this a match between Meeske and Clarence Weber, who had recently come out of retirement, was hotly anticipated but Meeske postponed scheduling a bout due to his commitments with the South Melbourne Football Club, although he did wrestle and beat Charlie Honroths in late June. In July the date of a Meeske and Weber wrestling match was set, and the prospect received interest throughout the month. In early August Meeske won a Ju-Jitsu match against Billy Kopsch which was billed as a 'fight to the death' due to strangle holds being allowed. They fought a second Ju-Jitsu match with the stipulation that they wear jackets in late August which Meeske also won. In late August Weber and Meeske participated in vaudeville acts to promote their match, demonstrating feats of strength, and they finally wrestled on 1 September 1923 before a crowd reported to be from 8,000 to 9,000 strong with Weber dominating the match and winning the championship. Meeske claimed to have been hampered by injuring his knee during training, and limped from the ring, but declined to release a medical certificate due to 'medical etiquette'. Shortly after the match he offered to wager one hundred pounds that he could defeat Weber in a fair fight. Cruiserweight champion After losing the championship Meeske performed at a local concerts across Victoria, performing demonstrations of feats of strength and agility and Russian dancing. He also gave wrestling exhibitions in Melbourne alongside Weber, and their joint promotional work was credited with greatly increasing the popularity of professional wrestling in Melbourne. Billy Meeske, 1924 In November 1923 Meeske announced his knee had recovered and he was ready to wrestle again, and a match against Jim McMurdo was scheduled for the cruiserweight championship with Meeske describing it as a chance to have \\"another chance at Weber.\\" Meeske spoke positively about McMurdo's skill prior to the match, which took place in December and was described as an even contest which Meeske won with some cheating. A notable spot in the match was Meeske being thrown out of the ring and landing on a reporter. In January 1924 Meeske and McMurdo were scheduled to wrestle again but McMurdo was injured causing the match to be canceled. In February Meeske wrestled Charles Honroth instead in a match which Meeske won, but was criticized for being slow paced. Meeske then accused Weber of avoiding a match against him, and reiterated that he felt he had only lost due to his leg injury. In March 1924 Meeske was scheduled to fight Peter Fatouras, a Greek wrestler, in his debut in a challenge match in which he had to throw Fatouras out of the ring twice. He claimed to have cut open his hand on a kerosene tin full of soap ahead of the match, which was postponed as Meeske was booked to wrestle the visiting American wrestler Walter Miller after Weber pulled out of a match against him. The bout was promoted as being a test of the standard of Australian wrestling relative to America, and a test of whether Meeske deserved to challenge for the world championship. Miller defeated Meeske, badly injuring his shoulder in the finish resulting in tension between both wrestlers camps, Meeske demonstrating discontent with his own team for throwing in the towel after his injury, and Miller being heckled as he left the ring. In late May 1924 Meeske expressed that he wanted a no-rules rematch with Walter Miller before he returned to America and then a title match against Weber. The Miller-Meeske rematch took place in June and was evenly matched going the distance with Miller winning on points to the crowds dismay, although there was a lack of heat for the match and attendance was poor. Meeske almost immediately issued a challenge for a second rematch wagering two hundred pounds that he could beat Miller, and it was suggested that a rematch may decide the heavyweight championship, as Miller had beaten reigning champion Clarence Weber, however it was determined that as Miller had not lived in Australia for six months before beating Weber he could not qualify as champion and the match did not go ahead. Miller invited Meeske to come to America with him when he departed Australia. In October 1924 Meeske visited Brisbane, Queensland, to assist a team of amateur boxers and wrestlers and during his time there he trained for a match against Peter Limutkin. The Limutkin match was scheduled to take place in Sydney, New South Wales, and was the first major professional wrestling event in the city since before the war began, and the first time Meeske had wrestled in Sydney. It was organized as a result of the success of professional wrestling events involving Walter Miller in Melbourne. To promote the match both wrestlers gave training displays at the stadium where it was going to take place in late October. The match took place in late October and was attended by an estimated 2,000 or 3,000 people, which Meeske regarded as less than he expected, although he felt there was potential for professional wrestling to gain popularity. It went the full rounds with Meeske winning by decision although a doctor determining Limutkin had fractured a rib during it. Meeske went on holiday to the Blue Mountains after the match before returning to Melbourne in November and beginning to train to face Weber. American light-heavy champion wrestler Ted Thye visited Australia in late 1924 and Meeske was scheduled to wrestle him in Sydney in December although he needed to secure leave of absence from his position with Victorian Railways to make the trip. Thye won the match using a toehold and forcing Meeske to tapout. The match impressed a manager to the extent that they immediately arranged a rematch, suggesting that as Meeske was Australian cruiserweight champion and Thye was American cruiserweight champion it could be billed as a world championship match, although a report did note that there was not a full house in attendance. When he returned to Melbourne after the match Meeske told reporters there was no ill will between him and Thye, noting that they had soaped each others backs in the showers after the bout. In late December Thye and Meeske wrestled in Sydney a second time and went for the full eight rounds with the match being called a draw on points. The second match was also poorly attended resulting in the future of professional wrestling in Sydney being questioned. Meeske demonstrating a toehold, 1924 In January 1925 Meeske lost to Al Karasik in Melbourne in a wrestling match which devolved into a brawl with a dozen men reportedly being required to separate them to end the match. In late January Weber announced he was ready to wrestle Meeske in a championship bout, however Meeske responded that he was already making preparations to participate in a cruiserweight world championship and have a rematch with Karasick to prepare and would have to wait until after the championship to wrestle Weber, and noted that he had challenged Weber several times in the past year with no response. Weber retorted that Meeske had also kept him waiting for several months before their first championship match. In February Meeske challenged Karasick to a rematch, stating he had developed a counter to his headholds. In March Walter Miller returned to Australia and Meeske was scheduled to be his first opponent, however Stadiums Ltd. instead booked Karasick to face Miller, resulting in Meeske expressing that he had been treated unfairly by the company, and as such he expressed his intention to move to America after wrestling Bill Dutton, who had challenged him in January, and issuing a challenge to Peter Limutkin or Sam Burmeister. A media report on Meeske's comments noted that he had been overlooked by promoters in recent years who were favoring visiting wrestlers from overseas, causing the careers of Australian wrestlers like Meeske to be neglected and the professional wrestling scene overall to slump when the visitor left the country. On March 29 Meeske beat Dutton in Wollongong, and in April he secured a match against Sam Burmeister who threatened to crush Meeske's shoulders into the canvas ahead of the bout, however Meeske won the match which was described as a poor exhibition. Meeske did not follow through on his threat to leave the country after wrestling Burmeister as Walter Miller had issued a general challenge to all Australian wrestlers which he intended to accept, and in preparation he renewed his challenge to Karasick. In May 1925 he secured publicity by challenging Karasick in person at a match between Thye and Karasick which was accepted, however he was ultimately booked to face Miller instead in late May and outscored Miller on points, but lost due to being pinned. In August 1925 he won a match against Indian wrestler Mahomet Ali Sunni, and lost against American wrestler James O'Connell, who was billed as the welter and middle-weight world champion. As of September Meeske was again planning to go to America, but late in the month he wrestled Sam Burmister again, this time in Adelaide in the first professional wrestling event in the city for many years which Meeske won, although it was noticed that Burmister only made aggressive maneuvers twice in the match, allowing Meeske to attack for the majority of the time. He was scheduled to wrestle Karasick again in October, but Karasick reported he was unfit on the scheduled date. Billy Meeske with the Pacific Coast Championship belt, 1926. Wrestling abroad In October 1925 Meeske departed Australia for America with his wife on the ship Aorangi, and he was fare-welled by colleagues of the Railways Institute at an evening in his honor and given a travel rug by the South Melbourne Football Club upon his departure. En route to America Meeske visited New Zealand and won two wrestling matches, against a Brown and Simpson, in Auckland. Meeske first arrived in Vancouver, staying for two days, before travelling on to Chicago through Seattle and Portland. As of November 1925 he had settled in Sioux City, Iowa, and won three wrestling matches there, and despite his absence from the country he was still being reported as the Australian cruiserweight champion. In December he beat Vladimir Kuzmak. By January 1926 Meeske had moved to Chicago where he signed with the promoter Ed White for six matches and began training with Strangler Lewis, and he defeated Mike Yokel for the Pacific Coast Light Heavyweight Championship (billed as the world light heavy-weight belt) that month. By February he had defeated Ralph Hands, billed as champion of San Francisco, and August Burch, billed as champion of Salt Lake City. In early February he beat Ralph Hands in a rematch and also beat Al Karasick who was also in America. On 18 February 1926 he had his first loss in America to Billy Edwards in a match in Portland, dropping the Pacific Coast Light Heavyweight championship, due to kicking Edwards in the chin during the bout which he claimed was an accident. His wrestling schedule was becoming busier and in late February he defeated Ralph Hands a third time and Frank Pilling in the same week he lost to Edwards. He lost a rematch to Edwards before the close of February, and in early March he lost to Karasick. In total Meeske wrestled twenty-eight matches and won twenty-six of them while in America. He noted that American wrestling audiences were very hostile to him as a foreigner, and after one match he assaulted a fan who was abusing him as he left the ring and was pursued by police, but after explaining the situation he was not arrested, although on another occasion he claimed a local chief of police threatened to run him out of town. In one match a fan invaded the ring to interfere and drew a gun when Meeske hit him, but was swiftly rushed by several people and disarmed. Sydney Stadiums Ltd. organized for several wrestlers, including Meeske, to come to Australia from America to wrestle in March 1926. His successful run in America was noted as an indication he would be an even competitor with the rest of the touring wrestlers. He visited New Zealand before arriving back in Australia, and wrestled H. Anderson, the New Zealand light-heavyweight champion, three times winning twice and losing once. Pursuit of the Heavyweight Championship He arrived back in Melbourne on 22 April 1926 and resumed employment with Victorian Railways and as a trainer with the South Melbourne Football Club. In May he made a public appearance at Melbourne Stadium and received a large ovation. He wrestled his first match after returning against the American Mike Yokel on May 16 in what was described as one of the cruelest and roughest wrestling matches ever seen in Melbourne, with moves becoming gradually more extreme until Yokel appeared to render Meeske unconscious and began celebrating before being disqualified. The American 'rough-house' style was not well received by audiences and Meeske adopted more conventional wrestling in a match against Martin Ludecke the following week, which he lost. In June a boxing committee attempted to have Meeske come to Broken Hill to wrestle, but he responded that he was under contract with Stadium Ltd. for a few more matches. By the end of June a title match between Meeske and the reigning heavyweight champion Clarence Weber had been scheduled for July 10, and there was an immediate heavy demand for bookings. Emphasis was placed on the fact Meeske had improved from their last bout by enhancing his technique in America in the leadup to the match, although general sentiment was reportedly that Weber would retain the title. The two wrestlers attracted a large crowd just for a demonstration session in which they demonstrated wrestling holds ahead of the match. They wrestled on July 11 and it was an even match until Meeske was disqualified for knocking Weber out with a punch to the jaw after which Weber's camp invaded the ring and Meeske was heckled as he fled to his dressing room protected by several police constables, with Weber receiving loud cheers when he came to. After the match Meeske claimed the blow was accidental and said he would wrestle Weber again any time. The crowd reaction to the Weber-Meeske match was described as unprecedented and prompted the manager of the stadium where the match took place to launch an inquiry, during which fellow wrestlers Mike Yokel and Martin Ludecke explained that such blows easily occur in wrestling by accident, with Yokel showing injuries to prove it. Weber also stated that Meeske had apologized to him and asked for leniency. It was concluded that Meeske could retain his share of the gate money, with the manager of Stadiums Ltd. publicly warning Meeske to avoid roughness in future. In early August Meeske made an appearance at ringside at a match between Sam Clapham, a British wrestler billed as the British Empire champion, and Ted Thye in Melbourne. In late August Meeske denied that Clapham was the best wrestler in the British Empire and challenged him to a match to prove it, however ultimately no match took place. He was training wrestlers as of 1926 and in late August he gave an exhibition with his students at a carnival in Northcote. By September the Weber rematch had been scheduled, which took place on September 18. Despite crowd expectations of rough behavior Meeske beat Weber cleanly with conventional wrestling to become Heavyweight Champion of Australia for the second time in his career. The match was noted as lacking the animosity that had come to characterize recent high profile wrestling matches, being completely clean. Second reign as Heavyweight Champion Meeske retained the cruiserweight championship of Australia after becoming heavyweight champion, and as such calls for him to wrestle Sam Clapham, who by this time was being billed as the world cruiserweight championship, continued throughout October 1926, however Clapham's schedule was already full up until he was to depart the country making it impossible to schedule a bout. Billy Meeske, 1927. In early October 1926 Meeske wrestled Mike Yokel and lost after retiring due to being thrown out of the ring onto the steps and then the stone floor, which did not cause a change in the heavyweight title as Yokel did not qualify as an Australian. Weber challenged Meeske for another shot at the heavyweight title late in November and it was suggested a rematch could take place before the end of the year, however Meeske wrestled Yokel a second time instead to close the year's wrestling season in an 'all-in' match in which ju-jitsu holds were allowed. Meeske wrestled Con Keatos in a demonstration to promote the Yokel match, which took place in early November 1926 and was won by Yokel, with one spot featuring Yokel pointing to Meeske's trunks to imply they were falling and tackling him when he looked. During the match the referees shirt was ripped off when he tried to separate the fighters and Meeske tackled the referee once and threw Yokel out of the ring several times reflecting the 'all-in' nature of the match. The match was well-attended and a rematch was swiftly organized for the following week, shortly before Yokel was to return to America, and tickets to the rematch sold well. Yokel beat Meeske again in the match which was well- received by the crowd, but some felt it incorporated too much ju-jitsu at the expense of wrestling holds which was a criticism leveled at the direction professional wrestling had taken in general over the year. In December Peter Limutkin challenged Meeske to a match. In April 1927 Meeske opened his year by wrestling Canadian champion Billy Edwards, billed as the roughest wrestler in the world, and lost by appearing to be rendered unconscious by a headlock and carried from the ring. The match was 'all-in' featuring biting, gouging, and assault of the referee from Edwards, however Meeske wrestled cleanly. In late May Meeske wrestled Ted Thye and lost due to being pinned, and while the match impressed some critics its clean nature and lack of brutality bored spectators. In June 1927 Clarence Weber accused Meeske of ignoring his challenge despite agreeing to defend the title against him in January, and announced that if Meeske did not respond in fourteen days he would claim the heavyweight title for himself by default, which prompted Meeske to agree to schedule a bout. They wrestled in August and the match went the full rounds and was drawn on points with Meeske retaining the title, however the match was of very low quality with the lack of athleticism, particularly due to Weber's age, making spectators suspect that the contest was staged and it was suggested that the match may lead to a collapse in professional wrestling in Melbourne. In September Meeske made acrobatic vaudeville appearances and it was suggested that he could make a career outside of wrestling as an entertainer. In October 1927 Meeske wrestled John Kilonis in Melbourne and won after Kilonis was disqualified for kicking him in the face and throwing him out of the ring. After the disqualification Meeske and Kilonis fought an impromptu boxing match which resulted in Kilonis being knocked out of the ring onto the press seats, however it was observed that he was sent out of the ring by a light tap and the match was described as \\"a huge joke\\", although it was also reported it received a positive reaction from the audience. Before the end of the month they fought a mixed boxing/wrestling rematch with Kilonis winning the wrestling match and Meeske winning the boxing bout but punching Kilonis after receiving the decision resulting in a short scuffle.

The regiment was officially mustered into service on January 17, 1862. It fought at the Battle of Pea Ridge in Arkansas in March before being transferred across the Mississippi River. While stationed at Corinth, Mississippi, the regiment played a minor role in the Battle of Farmington before the evacuation of the town. In September, the unit saw light action at the Battle of Iuka before being heavily engaged during the Second Battle of Corinth as the Confederates attempted to retake the town in October. In early 1863, the regiment was transferred to Grand Gulf, Mississippi, in order to strengthen the defenses of the Mississippi River at that point. At the Battle of Grand Gulf on April 29, the unit helped repulse a Union Navy attack against the Confederate defensive works. After elements of the Union Army of the Tennessee landed below Grand Gulf, the regiment fought in a delaying action at the Battle of Port Gibson on May 1. After the Confederate defeat at Port Gibson, the 3rd Missouri Infantry Regiment was engaged at the Battle of Champion Hill, another unsuccessful attempt to stop Major General Ulysses S. Grant's advance against Vicksburg, on May 16. The regiment was routed the next day at the Battle of Big Black River Bridge while serving as part of the rear guard. After Big Black River Bridge, the unit entered the fortifications of Vicksburg, which were soon besieged. During the Siege of Vicksburg, the regiment was often used as a reserve unit, although it saw heavy fighting during a Union assault against the Stockade Redan on May 22. On July 4, the Confederate garrison of Vicksburg surrendered, and the survivors of the regiment were eventually paroled and exchanged. On October 6, the regiment was combined with the 5th Missouri Infantry Regiment to form the 3rd and 5th Missouri Infantry Regiment (Consolidated). The new regiment then fought in the Atlanta campaign in 1864 before being almost annihilated at the Battle of Franklin on November 30, 1864. In early 1865, the consolidated regiment was transferred to Mobile, Alabama, where it surrendered on April 9. Background and formation When the American Civil War began in 1861, Missouri voted against secession, despite being a slave state. Claiborne Fox Jackson, the Governor of Missouri, supported secession and sent sympathetic elements of the Missouri militia to St. Louis, where an arsenal was located. On May 10, Brigadier General Nathaniel Lyon of the Union Army dispersed Jackson's militia in the Camp Jackson affair. Jackson responded on May 12 by forming the Missouri State Guard, a militia unit. Major General Sterling Price was appointed to command the unit. Lyon, in turn, drove Jackson and the pro-secession elements of the state legislature out of the capital of Jefferson City on June 15. Jackson and company then moved to Boonville, but their stay there was brief, as Lyon took the city after the Battle of Boonville on June 17. Price and Jackson then retreated into southwestern Missouri. Price's force was later joined by Brigadier General Ben McCulloch's Confederate States Army force. On August 10, Lyon attacked the combined force near Springfield, but he was killed and his command defeated in the Battle of Wilson's Creek. Price then began moving north towards the Missouri River. In September, the Missouri State Guard besieged and captured Lexington. However, Union reinforcements moved into the area, prompting Price to return to southwestern Missouri. While at Neosho in November, Jackson and the pro- secession legislators voted to secede from the United States, joining the Confederate States of America as a government-in-exile. The anti-secession elements of the state legislature had previously reaffirmed their position in Jefferson City in July, giving the state two conflicting governments. The 3rd Missouri Infantry Regiment was mustered into the Confederate States Army on January 17, 1862, while it was stationed at Springfield. Initially, it was planned to name it the 2nd Missouri Infantry Regiment, but it was found that two Missouri infantry regiments had already entered Confederate service, necessitating a designation as the 3rd Missouri Infantry Regiment. The regiment soon joined the First Missouri Brigade. Benjamin A. Rives was the regiment's first colonel, James A. Pritchard was appointed as the first lieutenant colonel, and Finley L. Hubbell was the first major. As of the muster date, the regiment contained ten companies, designated with the letters AI and K; all were Missouri-raised. Service history=1862Pea Ridge= On February 12, 1862, the regiment left Springfield for Cove Creek, Arkansas, as part of a Confederate withdrawal caused by Union pressure. The 3rd Missouri Infantry saw some action as a rear guard unit during the retreat. On March 3, the regiment left Cove Creek as part of a Confederate advance against a Union force that was in the Pea Ridge, Arkansas, area. Over the course of the subsequent battle, the regiment was in the First Missouri Brigade, which was commanded by Colonel Lewis Henry Little. On the morning of March 7, Price's division, which contained Little's brigade, encountered Union troops near a position known as Cross Timber Hollow. Little's brigade was deployed in line; the 3rd Missouri Infantry was assigned a line of advance along Telegraph Road, which ran through the area. In the afternoon, Little's brigade attacked a Union line arrayed around the Elkhorn Tavern. At one point the fighting, the 3rd Missouri Infantry, led from the front by Rives, initially drove the enemy back before becoming disorganized and halting. On March 8, a Union cannonade forced the 3rd Missouri Infantry back from an exposed position in an open field to a more protected one in some woods. A Union counterattack then drove in the right flank of Little's brigade, causing the Missourians to retreat. Rives had been mortally wounded on either the 7th or the 8th; Pritchard took over command of the regiment in Rives' stead. The regiment's losses at Pea Ridge are variously reported as either 104 (26 killed, 45 wounded, and 33 missing) or 117 (39 killed, 45 wounded, and 33 missing). =Second Corinth= Second Battle of Corinth After the defeat at Pea Ridge, the regiment fell back to the Van Buren, Arkansas, area. In late March, the regiment transferred to Des Arc, Arkansas. Crossing the Mississippi River, the regiment reached Memphis, Tennessee, on April 7, but was soon sent to Corinth, Mississippi, where a roll call was performed on May 5, determining that 450 men of the regiment were present for duty. On May 9, the regiment was present at the Battle of Farmington, but did not see much action. In late May, the Siege of Corinth ended when the Confederates evacuated the town, and the 3rd Missouri Infantry spent the summer stationed at various points in northern Mississippi. Price's army then moved to Iuka, Mississippi, where it was trapped by Union forces. At the Battle of Iuka on September 19, the regiment was subjected to artillery fire, but was not otherwise engaged. After the battle, the Confederates were able to escape from the Union trap. Price and Major General Earl Van Dorn then united and moved to retake Corinth. At the Second Battle of Corinth on October 3 and 4, the 3rd Missouri Infantry was part of Colonel Elijah Gates' brigade of Brigadier General Louis H√©bert's division. On October 3, Gates' brigade reinforced Brigadier General Martin E. Green's brigade in a charge against a stubborn Union line, but only the 2nd Missouri Infantry Regiment was heavily engaged. However, even with Gates' brigade in good shape, Price determined not to attempt a large-scale assault against the interior Union lines on the 3rd. On October 4, Gates' brigade and Green's brigade (now commanded by Colonel William H. Moore) began an assault against the interior Union works around 10:00 a.m. The target of Gates' brigade was a fortification known as Battery Powell. The 3rd Missouri Infantry clashed with the 52nd Illinois Infantry Regiment, defeating the Union regiment. However, Pritchard was shot in the shoulder and had to be carried off the field; Hubbell took command of the regiment. Pritchard's wound proved to be mortal. Gates' brigade was able to capture Battery Powell, but was driven off by a Union counterattack. Hubbell reported that most of the 3rd Missouri Infantry broke and was routed during the retreat. The regiment lost 92 men at Second Corinth. William R. Gause, who had been promoted from command of Company B to lieutenant colonel in May, took over the regiment permanently after the battle. 1863Grand Gulf, Port Gibson, and Champion Hill= Movements towards Champion Hill In early 1863, the regiment was transferred to the Big Black River, where it guarded a bridge. In March, the regiment moved to Grand Gulf, Mississippi, where the men built fortifications, strengthening the defenses of Vicksburg, Mississippi. On April 5, the 3rd Missouri Infantry, as part of a larger force, was moved across the Mississippi River into Louisiana, where they encamped near Bayou Vidal in Tensas Parish. On April 8, the unit fought in a small action at James' Plantation nearby. An attempt by the reconnaissance force to strike a major blow against Union forces occupying the area on April 15 failed when the element of surprise for a planned attack was lost. On April 17, the arrival of Union Navy ships forced the Confederates to return to Mississippi. The regiment then rejoined the defenses at Grand Gulf. At the Battle of Grand Gulf on April 29, the 3rd Missouri Infantry defended a line of rifle pits that extended between the two main Confederate fortifications. The unit's position allowed the men to shoot into the portholes of the Union Navy ships shelling the Confederate position. The regiment lost one man killed and three wounded in the battle. The Confederate victory prevented Union Major General Ulysses S. Grant from landing a force at that point, although Grant was able to land a strong force south of the position. Brigadier General John S. Bowen, the Confederate commander at Grand Gulf, responded to the Union landing by sending a force to Port Gibson, Mississippi to intercept Grant. At the Battle of Port Gibson on May 1, the 3rd Missouri Infantry, along with the 5th Missouri Infantry Regiment, supported the Confederate left flank. The two regiments remained in reserve for much of the early fighting. In the early afternoon, when the Confederate left was in danger of breaking, the two regiments were sent to assault the Union right flank. However, Union leadership noticed the threat and sent troops to support the area where they expected the attack. A canebrake provided cover for the Confederate attack, which fell upon a Union line composed of the brigades of Colonel James R. Slack and Brigadier General George F. McGinnis and five artillery batteries. Despite breaking Slack's right, the weight of superior Union numbers and effective Union artillery fire drove the Confederates back to the cover of a creek bank. After two hours, the two regiments began to run low on ammunition and were ordered to withdraw. However, the attack had bought valuable time for the main Confederate line to regroup. One historian reports the 3rd Missouri Infantry's Port Gibson casualties as 24, while another has estimated that the 3rd and 5th Missouri suffered a combined total in excess of 200 casualties. The Confederates then fell back from Port Gibson, burning bridges in the process. In turn, Grant moved east in order to aim his attack at an angle that would trap the Confederates in Vicksburg. During the movement, Grant captured Jackson, Mississippi. The Confederate force at Vicksburg was commanded by Lieutenant General John C. Pemberton. Another Confederate force, commanded by General Joseph E. Johnston was positioned north of Jackson. Johnston ordered Pemberton to move east from Vicksburg so that the Confederates could join together to strike Grant. While making the necessary movements, some of Pemberton's force encountered elements of Grant's army on May 16, starting the Battle of Champion Hill. At Champion Hill, Company G of the 3rd Missouri Infantry was detached from the regiment as part of a unit of skirmishers drawn from the various regiments of the First Missouri Brigade. Hubbell, who was by then a lieutenant colonel, commanded the detachment. Later in the battle, the Confederate left was severely threatened by Union assaults, and the First Missouri Brigade was sent to shore up the failing line. The brigade's right flank was exposed, and the rightmost regiment, the 5th Missouri Infantry, was forced to fall back. That movement in turn exposed the flank of the 3rd Missouri Infantry, which also fell back. After regrouping, the two regiments counterattacked to regain the line of their former positions. The entire brigade then charged the main Union position, capturing a crossroads and Champion Hill, two key battlefield locations. Hubbell was mortally wounded by a shot through the arm during the charge. However, Union reinforcements and massed artillery fire first stopped, and then repulsed, the charge. The men of the First Missouri Brigade, including the 3rd Missouri Infantry, were forced to retreat. The regiment lost 143 men as casualties at Champion Hill, including 36 killed. =Big Black River Bridge and the Siege of Vicksburg= National Park Service map showing the location of the Stockade Redan On May 17, the First Missouri Brigade was part of a rear guard holding the crossing of the Big Black River. However, a Union charge broke the Confederate line and routed the defenders. The regiment then entered the defensive works at Vicksburg, which were then besieged by Union forces. On May 18, Cockrell's brigade was engaged in a small action near Mint Spring Bayou. This forward position was determined to be dangerous due to a large ravine between it and the main Confederate line, so it was abandoned on the 19th. The 3rd Missouri Infantry was used as a reserve when Union forces attacked on May 19. On May 22, the men of the regiment manned the Confederate line at a point known as the Stockade Redan, where they, as well as other elements of the First Missouri Brigade, fought off Union attacks against the position. Many of the attacking Union soldiers were also Missourians, including the men of the 6th, 8th, and the 11th Missouri Infantry Regiments. When the attack failed, a number of Union soldiers were trapped in a ditch in front of the Confederate position. One soldier of the 3rd Missouri Infantry asked the Union soldiers if they wanted to surrender. When the men refused to surrender, a Confederate soldier then threw a cannonball at the men, striking one in the face. When the Union soldiers still refused to surrender, men of the 3rd Missouri Infantry secured a number of artillery shells, lit the fuses, and then threw the explosive shells into the Union position as improvised hand grenades. The regiment saw further action repulsing Union assaults in June and July, but it was frequently used as a reserve unit. By the time the Confederate garrison of Vicksburg surrendered on July 4, the regiment had suffered 55 casualties. After the capitulation, the survivors of the regiment were paroled, although about 100 men deserted. The men of the regiment then moved to Demopolis, Alabama, and were exchanged on September 12. On October 6, the regiment was combined with the 5th Missouri Infantry to form the 3rd and 5th Missouri Infantry Regiment (Consolidated); the 3rd Missouri Infantry ceased to exist as a separate unit. Legacy The 3rd Missouri Infantry had been reduced to four companies during the process of consolidating with the 5th Missouri Infantry; these companies became Companies B, D, E, and H within the consolidated regiment. Colonel James McCown of the 5th Missouri Infantry commanded the new regiment, as Gause, commander of the 3rd Missouri Infantry, had been transferred to the Trans-Mississippi Department. The regiment fought in the Atlanta campaign in 1864, including at the Battle of New Hope Church on May 25 and at the Battle of Kennesaw Mountain on June 19. On October 5, the regiment fought at the Battle of Allatoona, where it suffered 76 casualties, and on November 30, at the Battle of Franklin, where it lost 113 of the approximately 150 remaining men. In February 1865, the regiment was transferred to Mobile, Alabama, adding to the city's defenses, where it surrendered on April 9 at the Battle of Fort Blakely. Commanders Three men served as colonel of the 3rd Missouri Infantry Regiment, none of whom were with the regiment when it was consolidated with the 5th Missouri Infantry: Rives (mortally wounded at Pea Ridge), Pritchard (mortally wounded at Second Corinth), and Gause (transferred in September 1863). Pritchard, Gause, Hubbell, and James K. McDowell were the regiment's lieutenant colonels. Hubbell, McDowell, and Robert J. Williams all held the rank of major in the regiment.

The network is headquartered in Barracas, Buenos Aires. Net TV made its formal debut on October 1, 2018 with the cooking-themed talk show Como Todo, becoming the sixth \\"must carry\\" broadcast network of Argentina and the first in 54 years, after the 1964 launch of Am√©rica TV.  History  Net TV was conceived by Grupo Perfil's founder Jorge Fontevecchia, with the idea to expand the publishing company into audiovisual media. In October 2015, Fontevecchia opened the company's new headquarters in the Barracas neighborhood of Buenos Aires, which were equipped with radio and television studios, and presented to the Federal Authority for Audiovisual Communication Services (AFSCA) a proposal to license new radio and television stations. The original plan included AM and FM radio stations and must carry digital television networks. On September 25, 2015, the proposal was rejected by the AFSCA due to \\"flaws\\" in the documentation that was presented. In 2016, Perfil sought the licenses again, and finally obtained them for AM 1190 kHz, FM 101.9 MHz and two digital television channels in the Buenos Aires area through the National Communications Entity (ENACOM) resolutions 1107/16 and 1108/16 published on October 19, 2016, in the State Official Bulletin gazette, to cover the area of Greater Buenos Aires. This is how finally the Grupo Perfil obtained the license for Net TV on digital channel 27.2, Alfa TV on channel 21.1, and Bravo TV on channel 27.1 (these last two still continue with broadcast testing). Due to the nature of its must carry license, all cable television systems must include it on their lineups.  Programming  Net TV began airing original programming on weekdays from 12 p.m. to 12:30 a.m. since launch.

Early Life Laura Alves Magno was born in Lisbon, Portugal on 8 September 1921, the daughter of Mariana Alves and Celestino Magno. She attended the Machado de Castro School (now the site of Lisbon‚Äôs Hotel and Tourism School) and the National Conservatory School of Lisbon (). She first performed live at the age of five in a play by a recreational group of which her father was a member. At six she performed with the Lisbon Amateur Dramatics Group (Grupo Dram√°tico Lisbonense) and continued to perform at her school. Her professional debut came in 1935, 20 days before her fourteenth birthday, when she played opposite the well-known Portuguese actor Alves da Cunha in ‚ÄúThe two girls of Paris‚Äù (As duas garotas de Paris) at Lisbon‚Äôs Teatro Politeama. She then spent two seasons at the D. Maria II National Theatre in Lisbon. From the time she was 14, her father, a shoemaker by profession and a victim of schizophrenia, was unable to work and Alves became the family's financial provider. Career In 1941 she performed her first operetta, at the Teatro Variedades in Lisbon. In 1942, she performed in a revue for the first time at the Teatro Maria Vit√≥ria, alongside Am√°lia Rodrigues, the actress and fado singer. Throughout her career she performed about 400 plays, musicals and other shows. Several were taken on tour, both within Portugal and to Spain and Brazil. When not acting she travelled to London, Paris and New York to familiarise herself with the latest theatrical trends. A large number of her performances were at the Teatro Monumental, which opened in November 1951 and was leased by the actor and impresario Vasco Morgado, who Alves had married in 1948. This theatre had over one thousand seats and for it to be commercially viable had to offer shows popular to the general public. Alves' popularity and her commitment to her husband meant that she performed frequently at the Monumental. Her presence on the cast guaranteed that a play would be a success. As a result, she had few chances to explore her range in less-popular plays. Critics would often note that her talents were being wasted, although she did occasionally venture into more demanding characters, such as in plays by Shakespeare, as Margaret in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof by Tennessee Williams and in plays by the Portuguese playwright Bernardo Santareno. She also did radio theatre on the RCP station (R√°dio Clube Portugu√™s). With the growth in the popularity of television, the size of the Teatro Monumental meant that it gradually ceased to be viable as a theatre. It was demolished in 1982, to great controversy. The event is said to have badly affected Laura Alves' health. Unhappy with the destruction of the theatre where she had achieved success and, suffering from memory lapses, she stopped performing in 1983. In her last performance Alves was visibly weak. Her popularity had also been affected by her criticisms of the Carnation Revolution in 1974, which had seen the overthrow of the Estado Novo, the authoritarian government that had controlled Portugal for half a century. Alves is now known to the Portuguese public primarily for the films she made, which are still shown on Portugal‚Äôs TV stations. In particular, three films made in the 1940s remain popular; her first, The Tyrant Father (O Pai Tirano); O Le√£o da Estrela; and O P√°tio das Cantigas. Alves won many awards. In 1966, the Government awarded her the rank of Lady of the Military Order of Saint James of the Sword (). She was Best Cinema Actress in 1952 and won the Pr√©mio Lucinda Sim√µes for best theatre actress in 1953. In 1986 a film of her life, Laura Alves, Evoca√ß√£o de uma actriz (Laura Alves, Evocation of an actress) was released. A new film based on her life was at the planning stage at the end of 2019. Her name has been given to several streets in the Greater Lisbon area. Alves was featured on a 1996 postage stamp celebrating 100 years of cinema in Portugal. Alves separated from Morgado in 1967, but they continued to work together. In 1968, Morgado transformed the Cinema Rex in Lisbon into a theatre that he called ‚ÄúTeatro Laura Alves‚Äù. The theatre closed in the 1980s and, in 2012, the building was destroyed by fire. After Morgado‚Äôs death in 1978 she married the conductor, Frederico Val√©rio, who was to die three years later. She died in Lisbon on 6 May 1986 of a cerebral embolism.

Life  Born in G√ºstrow, Martiensen came from a large farming family, which apparently only immigrated to Mecklenburg in the generation of his father, the merchant Gottlieb Martienssen. At the time of the 1867 census in Mecklenburg-Schwerin the father was not yet in Mecklenburg. In 1900 he was no longer alive; Martienssen himself was a pupil in the G√ºstrow household of his mother Caroline, n√©e Schultz(e), who was born in Denmark. The father never seems to have become a citizen of G√ºstrow. In any case, his name is not found in the G√ºstrower B√ºrgerbuch accumulated by Franz Schubert (Franz Schubert: B√ºrgerb√ºcher aus Mecklenburg. Volume 1: G√ºstrow.

He was also a student of Hans Sitt and Arthur Nikisch. In 1912 Martienssen married the singing teacher Franziska Martienssen-Lohmann. The marriage, which was divorced in 1927, produced two children. (In 1929 Franziska married the concert singer and voice pedagogue Paul Lohmann). From 1914 Martienssen was piano teacher at the Leipzig Conservatory, where he was appointed professor in 1932.Fred K.

After the Machtergreifung by the Nazis, he belonged to the NSDAP from 1 May 1933 (party number 2.382.346). In 1934 the Kampfbund f√ºr deutsche Kultur, led by Alfred Rosenberg, proposed his appointment as professor at the Universit√§t der K√ºnste Berlin, but he received his appointment only in 1935 and then as successor to Edwin Fischer, who had asked to be released from university service in order to concentrate on his concert activities.Joseph Wulf: Musik im Dritten Reich.

Description Starstone is a fantasy campaign setting that the publisher claimed could be used with any set of role-playing rules such as Dungeons & Dragons or RuneQuest. Reviewer Robert Hulston disagreed, calling this claim \\"a thinly veiled disguise, for Starstone seems to have been designed primarily for use with the D&D; game universe.\\" The book is divided into an introductory adventure and two scenarios that are all set in Starstone County, a troubled region that includes several villages, a goblin dungeon, a dwarven mine, and a dragon's lair. Introduction: \\"Strange Goings on at Longbottom Down\\" The adventurers are hired as caravan guards, but due to a broken bridge, the caravan is forced to divert to the village of Longbottom Down. The next morning, the caravan owner is missing, and the adventurers must find him. Chapter 1: \\"Sardkirk\\" The adventurers, having proven their worth, are hired to investigate disappearances near the village of Sardkirk. They find the main threat to be goblins in the nearby caverns of Broch. Chapter 2: \\"Dolgold\\" The adventurers investigate the rise of deadly rivalries in the village of Dolgold. Although the adventurers find ways to calm the troubles, their investigations also reveal clues as to the true cause of the troubles in Starstone County, which were to be the plot of the adventures published in the next installment, Ristenby Town. Publication history In 1982, Paul Vernon wrote a fantasy role-playing scenario set in Starstone County called \\"Embertrees\\" that was published in White Dwarf. Vernon followed up by writing two more adventures set in the same region, which were published as Starstone, a 40-page book with a removable map sheet that was released in the U.K. in 1982 by Northern Sages (U.K.) with a print run of three thousand copies. Artwork was by John Everett, Diane Hadfield, and Barrie Morton. Although the adventures in Starstone were supposedly a lead-in to Vernon's next product, Ristenby Town, the sequel was never published. Reception In the April 1983 edition of White Dwarf (Issue #40), Daniel Collerton admired the product, calling the scenarios \\"beautifully detailed and structured with background history, politics, family relationships and economics all given in addition to the usual monsters.\\" Collerton's only quibble was that \\"its very completeness means that it requires several readings to grasp fully.\\" He concluded by giving it an excellent overall rating of 9 out of 10, saying, \\"For those who prefer a coherent, highly detailed medieval milieu for their campaigns, Starstone could hardly be bettered. Even for those who don't like such a background, it still represents excellent value for the money merely as an example of meticulous campaign design. Very highly recommended.\\" In the July 1983 edition of Imagine (Issue 14), Robert Hulston thought highly of the product, saying, \\"Starstone will provide entertainment for many evenings, is exceptional value for money... and is highly recommended.\\" In the May 1985 edition of Dragon (Issue #97), Eric Pass was impressed with the amount of detail provided in the adventures, commenting, \\"Each is packed with enough information that the NPCs in the scenario know less about themselves that the reader does.\\" He called the introductory adventure \\"excellent,\\" saying that \\"it should be used as an example of creativeness within credulity.\\" However, Pass did criticize the introduction for moving the players to the town of Ristenby, when information about that town was only to be published in the next installment of adventures. Nonetheless, he highly recommended the book, saying, \\"Starstone is one of the best-detailed modules I have examined. If you have the time and the inclination to sample superior module design, buy it.\\" References Category:Fantasy role-playing game adventures ","title":"Starstone"},{"id":"64294675","text":"The 2010‚Äì11 VfB Stuttgart season was the 118th season in the club's football history.

It has been in the planning stages since the early 2010s and, as of 2019, gained regulatory authority approval for construction and operation in the 2020s, with initial export shipments as early as 2025. The facility is intended to enable US natural gas that is in good supply in the US to be efficiently stored and shipped to the global market in an efficient (liquified) form. The Texas LNG LLC company of Houston, Texas completed environmental review and received a permit from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) in 2019. The company is expected to make the final investment decision on the project no earlier than 2021, and start construction on the project as early as 2022.  Description  The project is intended, when fully built out circa 2030, to process up to 4 million tonnes of natural gas annually. Phase 1 of the project will process just half that, and could be operational as early as 2025. Phase 1 of the project will be able to process up to .  History  The United States has had a massive shift in LNG terminal planning and construction starting in 2010-2011 due to a rapid increase in US domestic natural gas supply with the widespread adoption of hydraulic fracking petroleum recovery technology. Many new LNG import terminals are planning or have begun addition of liquefaction facilities to operate as export terminals. Texas LNG LLC obtained the project site at the Port of Brownsville in 2013 (on the north side of the Brownsville Ship Channel Texas LNG -- Port of Brownsville), and completed conceptual design and preliminary engineering in 2014. The front-end engineering and design (FEED) study for the project was completed by Samsung Engineering in 2016.[https://www.nsenergybusiness.com/projects/texas-lng-project-brownsville- texas/ Texas LNG Project, Brownsville, Texas , nsenergybusiness.com, accessed 16 June 2020.

Life  Born in Berlin, H√ºlsen received his education from 1825 in the Cadet Corps in Potsdam. From there he was transferred to the 1st (Emperor Alexander) Guards Grenadiers of the Prussian Army on 5 August 1833 as f√§hnrich holder and advanced to second lieutenant in February 1834. Between 1841 and 1843 he was stationed in K√∂nigsberg and there got to know the actress Sophie Schr√∂der- Devrient, among others, via the theater. From 1844 he was entrusted with the performance of smaller plays for troop support in Berlin. In March 1848, H√ºlsen took part in the barricade fights in Berlin and became an oberleutnant and regimental adjutant at the beginning of April. In this position he was deployed during the First Schleswig War and in 1849 during the suppression of the May Uprising in Dresden. In this politically difficult time (German revolutions of 1848-49), King Frederick William IV of Prussia appointed him Generalintendant of the court music. On 12 April 1851 H√ºlsen was granted his farewell with the title of Hauptmann and permission to wear the regiment uniform. With his farewell in May 1851 he was appointed Kammerherr and, as the successor of , at King Friedrich Wilhelm IV's request Generalintendanten der K√∂niglichen Schauspiele zu Berlin (Konzerthaus Berlin, Staatsoper Unter den Linden) and took up this office on 1 June. In 1866 H√ºlsen was appointed a major and aide-de-camp for the duration of the Austro-Prussian War to the Berlin governorate. In the same year, by royal decree, the court theatres in Kassel, Hannover and Wiesbaden were also ordered under his direction. In 1883, H√ºlsen founded the \\"H√ºlsen Foundation\\" to support members of the ensemble in need or dire straits. During this time he also served as president of the Deutscher B√ºhnenverein. As such he enforced the theatre holidays common today and was decisively involved in the abolition of interlude music. Six weeks before his 71st birthday, H√ºlsen died on 30 September 1886 in Berlin and is buried there.  Sources  * Karl Frenzel: Berliner Dramaturgie. 2 volumes.

Biography  In his early art career, Lee-Nova spent 15 months in England as a student at Coventry College (1961‚Äì1962) and was introduced by his fellow students and teachers to a wider vision of art-making than was available at art school in Canada at the time. As an adolescent and young adult, Lee-Nova had several hero figures, both writers: the American William S. Burroughs, and the Canadian Marshall McLuhan. He has studied, collected, and corresponded with Burroughs, and sometimes also carried Burroughsian thinking in new directions in his art-making, Lee-Nova has said. McLuhan's words about electronic media also made him an enthusiast of the computer in his art. He has also said that his thinking about art was aided by the use of hallucinogenic drugs as well as by what he calls philosophies such as Zen-Buddhism that were becoming popular in the 1950s. Early in his exhibition history, Lee-Nova held a joint show in Vancouver with Claude Breeze who assisted him in his development. He started making films in 1965 and produced Steel Mushrooms in 1967 in collaboration with Dallas Selman. In 1967, he showed paintings and drawings in Toronto at the Carmen Lamanna Gallery and received praise from critic (and Vancouver Art Gallery director (1963‚Äì1967)) Richard Simmins who said he was the most promising painter from the west coast he had seen in recent years. In 1968, he showed at the Vancouver Art Gallery with Michael Morris Prisma: an environment, described by reviewer Marguerite Pinney as a strange and curious summer house with programmed light, music and colour. In Vancouver, he was a co-founder of Image Bank (with Michael Morris and Vincent Trasov) and active in the Sound Gallery (circa 1965) and Intermedia (1967‚Äì1972). He also worked with the spectrum as a motif and thereby began the Image Banks Colour Bar Research project. In addition, Lee-Nova was involved with the New York Corres-Sponge Dance School of Vancouver, and worked under the fictitious name of Artimus Rat or Art Rat. Lee-Nova continued to be a key figure on the West Coast Scene in the early 1970s, working with electronic media and film as well as painting and printmaking. He continued to work on projects that might take years to execute, or be created with other artists. For instance, his Out to Metric (1975) in the Vancouver Art Gallery collection, was made in collaboration with artist Alan Miller. It was created at the time the metric system was replacing the Imperial system of measurement in Canada and mocks the change that was occurring in the language about measurement through its construction. It used about 1400 yardsticks made into a partial room eight feet high. Lee-Nova's work was exhibited at galleries such as the Vancouver Art Gallery, Bau-Xi Gallery (Toronto), University of Saskatchewan, the Western Front, the Morris and Helen Belkin Art Gallery, the National Gallery of Canada, and the Paris Biennale. His papers are in the Gary Lee Nova Fonds, Morris and Helen Belkin Art Gallery, Vancouver.

He lives and works in New York City.  Work  Wynne‚Äôs work spans sculpture, jewelry, painting, drawing, collage, installations, design, and photography. Wynne‚Äôs early drawings and collages were influenced by the Fluxus Movement via Ray Johnson, a seminal figure of Neo-Dada and founder of the New York Correspondence School. Having met Johnson during the 1970s, Wynne says that ‚Äúthrough Ray I got interested in the idea of using a typewriter and Western Union, and we developed an epistolary relationship.\\" Wynne once went to Western Union and wrote a telegram to himself that read: ‚ÄúYou are still alive.‚Äù In the mid-70s Wynne scored music, opera, and soundscape for the dramatic readings of Marguerite Young‚Äôs epic novel Miss MacIntosh, My Darling as part of radio station WBAI‚Äôs series called ‚ÄúThe Reading Experiment.‚Äù Wynne's use of industrial materials in his work, such as his Xerox art, was a part of his first installation, Sphere Redux, at The Kitchen in New York City, in 1981. It consisted of two rear screen projections of a large rotating glass marble, scored with opera and breaking glass, synchronized with video monitors arranged along the base of one wall, hung with blueprint blow-ups of glass marbles, moon rocks, and caves, intermixed with portraits of friends whose features were overshadowed by masks. In the 1990s, Wynne‚Äôs exhibitions of paintings, sculptures, and prints at the Holly Solomon Gallery became installations; his works set against wallpaper with images from the opera La Sonnambula (Bellini) or The Flies (Sartre). In recent years, Wynne has become interested in glass as a medium. In the course of a visit to a glass foundry. ‚ÄúThere,‚Äù Wynne says, ‚ÄúI started this experiment. It was purely by accident. I was holding a ladle of molten glass when it slipped out of my hands and spilled onto the floor, making a huge splat, which was absolutely spectacular. And at that moment I thought it was a kind of cosmic explosion and that it would be so interesting to fix it permanently, silver it and see it really glimmer. That led me to realize that I could control it somewhat more than just letting it fall out of a ladle and I could start making actual letters...‚Äù Wynne began to use glass to create large scale text pieces. Wynne explained that his glass text pieces were intended to ‚Äúbe much more reflective so when you are reading them you see yourself reading them...\\" Olivia Ryder for UrbanGlass writes, \\"He effectively reinstates that reflective nature with his literary creations. The disassociated words and phrases, adopts the viewers voice and adds a layer of introspection, disrupting the barriers between art and viewer.\\" In Wynne‚Äôs 2018 show, FLOAT at the Brooklyn Museum of Art, he installed sixteen works within the American Art galleries. The works were placed in direct dialogue with selected works from the collection. Barbara A. MacAdam from the Brooklyn Rail described Wynne‚Äôs installations, ‚ÄúThe objects of the gallery‚Äîthe artifacts, paintings, sculpture, and furniture are reflected upon by the artist, literally and figuratively, and become a part of his, and our, stream of consciousness.‚Äú In his work, Wynne freely appropriates fragments of texts and images taken from literature, opera, theatre, and conversation. In addition to his work in glass, Wynne works with smoke, embroidery, paint, thread, bronze, and ceramics.

It was often called Bergsj√∂koa.J√§rnv√§gsslang Bergsj√∂koa History  The mayor of Hudiksvall made a proposal in 1890 for a railway between Hudiksvall and Bergsj√∂. A concession was granted in 1892 for a narrow gauge railway with aneast estimated building cost of SEK 870,000. For an additional SEK 30,000, an 891 mm gauge railway could be obtained and the concession for the change was established on August 16, 1895. Northern H√§lsingland Railway Company (NHJ) was formed on October 30, 1894 and the articles of association were adopted on March 1, 1895. The concession was transferred to the company and construction started in 1895. The track was opened for public transport on December 13, 1896. The posted building cost in 1912 was SEK 745,000 and the vehicle cost SEK 179,000. There were three steam locomotives, four passenger coaches and 56 freight cars.Historiskt om Svenska J√§rnv√§gar Norra H√§lsinglands J√§rnv√§g (\\"History of Swedish Railways Northern H√§lsingland Railway\\")Nordisk familjebok 1913 Norra H√§lsinglands J√§rnv√§g (\\"Nordic Family Book 1913 Northern H√§lsingland Railway\\"). At the same time as the route was planned, Hudiksvalls Tr√§varuaktiebolag planned the construction of a sawmaill in H√∂gen to cut the timber that floated on the trail from Hassela. NOJ offered Tr√§varubolaget to build a station in H√∂gen and to lend of rail. The mill was constructed and transport of timber from there to Hudiksvall harbor for export was important for the NHJ's economy.Bergsj√∂ √Öngs√•g i H√∂gen 1897-1928 H√∂gens Samh√§llsf√∂rening (\\"Bergsj√∂ Steam saw in H√∂gen 1897-1928 H√∂gens Samh√§llsf√∂rening\\"). Development  As early as 1911, a preliminary agreement was signed between NOJ and the East Coast Line (OKB) that OKN would buy NOJ by paying the debts and giving the shareholders in NHJ shares in OKB. The reason was that in OKB's concession it was written that consideration would be given to the negative impact on NHJ. The stretch of Hudiksvalls-Via would be part of OKB and the narrow-gauge line would be closed. Via-Bergsj√∂ was to be a line run by OKB. It was, until September 1, 1927, before the NHJ was purchased by OKB. The standard-gauge OKB was rebuilt through Hudiksvall city to the south of Rogsta and parallel to the NHJ to the north of Steg where a viaduct was built over the NHJ and further to Eds√§ter east of the town of Harm√•nger. A new narrow gauge railway was built from Eds√§ter on OKB to the south of the station Harm√•nger on the NHJ. NHJ was closed between Hudiksvall and the connection of the track from Eds√§ter. The rails were torn up in 1928 and then reused on the newly built part to replace the haevier rails which could instead be used on the standard gauge section. In connection with the opening, Eds√§tter station was renamed to Harm√•nger and the former Harm√•nger station on the NHJ changes to Vattr√•ngsby. The new stretch for NHJ: became Harm√•nger - Vattr√•ngsby - Bergsj√∂and, and was incorporated into the East Coast Line's organization. On November 1, 1927, the East Coast Line was opened for public transport and the traffic on the NHJ between Hudiksvall and Vattr√•ngsby was closed down simultaneously.Gamla J√§rnv√§gshistoriskt Forum Omlastningen Harm√•nger OKB (\\"Old Railway History Forum The transhipment Harm√•nger OKB\\").Gamla J√§rnv√§gshistoriskt Forum Rogsta station (\\"Old Railway Historical Forum Rogsta station\\"). In order to reduce the cost of transhipments, OKB acquired four narrow-gauge transfer flatcars for the transport of standard-gauge cars. OKB had large debts and on August 1, 1933, OKB including Harm√•nger-Bergsj√∂ was purchased by the Swedish state and incorporated into the National Railways (SJ) organization. The narrow gauge railway between Harm√•nger and Bergsj√∂ became the first 891 mm gauge railway operated by the National Railways.OKB, Ostkustbanan (\\"OKB, East Coast Line\\"). Bergsj√∂ saw the loss of its direct connection to the port of Hudiksvall when the connection was via transhipment in Harm√•nger. In addition to wood transport, wood waste from the sawmill had since 1916 gone to the port in Hudiksvall and on to the sulphate and sulphite factory in Iggesund. The H√∂gen sawmill ceased operations in 1928. The timber that had been sawn was then transported to H√•staholmen in Hudiksvall until in 1941 the forest companies agreed to change timber when the wood was floated on to Stocka. During the 1930s, SJ introduced rail buses for passenger traffic and two passenger cars were sold to Dala-Ockelbo-Norrsundets J√§rnv√§g, the other two were scrapped.Gamla J√§rnv√§gshistoriskt Forum NHJ personvagnar (\\"Old Railway History Forum NHJ passenger cars\\"). During the Second World War, the steam locomotive was able to handle passenger traffic with wagons from the narrow-gauge network in Sm√•land. The last of the original locomotive was scrapped in 1955. The remaining steam locomotive (SJ) and the Z4p locomotive were both equipped for compressed air brakes and when the remaining car park received compressed air brakes no longer needed the brake. Settlement  When OKB bought NHJ, a future conversion to standard gauge was included. The Swedish state was given this responsibility at the takeover of OKB and according to a parliamentary decision in 1945 it would be rebuilt.Svensk Uppslagsbok 1955 Norra H√§lsinglands J√§rnv√§g (\\"Swedish Reference Book 1955 Northern H√§lsingland Railway\\").

Biography  Van den Heuvel was born in Rotterdam; after the German bombing of Rotterdam he moved with his parents to Sliedrecht where he grew up along the Merwede.Aad van den Heuvel, crime.nl (via Wayback Machine) He attended HBS and studied to become a sports teacher, but became eventually a freelance reporter for several newspapers.  Career  In 1959 he visited KRO director Jan Castelijns for an interview, who thought he came to apply for a job. He was hired. One of his first reportages was in 1961 when the Berlin Wall was built. After this reportage, they founded the actuality program Brandpunt. In 1967 he interviewed the president of Indonesia, Sukarno, just before he was overthrown. His reportage during the Nigerian Civil War showed the world what happened between Biafra ans Nigeria He interviewed Martin Luther King just before his death. Until 1973 Van den Heuvel was Brandpunt reporter and presenter, and traveled around the world. Brandpunt became well known due to the reportages. After 1973, Van den Heuvel started a few television programs like J.C.J. van Speykshow, Cursief and Alles is Anders-show, followed by De Ver van mijn Bed-show and KRO Middageditie. He became especially known at the end of the 1980s with Ook dat nog!. Van den Heuvel was the anchorman of the humoristic program, working together with Sylvia Millecam, Erik van Muiswinkel, Hans B√∂hm and Gregor Frenkel Frank. Van den Heuvel founded in 1993 the production company Mediaat. In 1997 he was the main presenter for the KRO television program De Nieuwsgier,DutchMedia Editie 37b/1997 (mailing list), 20 April 1997 a program of quality interviews, columns and persiflages. He was assisted by Coen van Vrijberghe de Coningh, Wivineke van Groningen, Fred Florusse and Han Oldigs. To make more reportages about the Third World, like he did during his Brandpunt period, he founded De Nieuwe Omroep in 2000. In 2004 it merged with N√∫topia into De Nieuwe Omroep N√∫topia and in 2005 into LLiNK. This channel went bankrupt in 2010. As a radio presenter Van den Heuvel presented Blik op morgen and Op de valreep. He wrote a weekly column for Broadcast Magazine.

Such a sketch can be used to speed up explicit kernel methods, bilinear pooling in neural networks and is a cornerstone in many numerical linear algebra algorithms.Woodruff, David P. \\"Sketching as a Tool for Numerical Linear Algebra.\\" Theoretical Computer Science 10.1-2 (2014): 1‚Äì157. Mathematical definition Mathematically, a dimensionality reduction is a matrix M\\\\in\\\\mathbb R^{k,d}, where k, such that for any vector x\\\\in\\\\mathbb R^d it holds that :\\\\Mx\\\\_2 - \\\\x\\\\_2 < \\\\varepsilon\\\\x\\\\_2 with high probability. In other words M preserves the norm of vectors up to a small error. A Tensor sketch has the extra property that if x = y \\\\otimes z for some vectors y\\\\in\\\\mathbb R^{d_1}, z\\\\in\\\\mathbb R^{d_2} such that d_1d_2=d, the transformation M(y\\\\otimes z) can be computed extra efficiently. Typically M(y\\\\otimes z) = M' y \\\\circ M z, where \\\\circ is the (Hadamard) elementwise product. Since each of M' y and M z can be computed in time respectively kd_1 and kd_2, the computation is much faster than the full M(y\\\\otimes z) which would take time kd=kd_1d_2. For higher-order tensors, such as x = y\\\\otimes z\\\\otimes t the savings are even more impressive. History The term tensor sketch was coined in 2013 describing a technique by Rasmus Pagh from the same year. Originally it was understood using the fast Fourier transform to do fast convolution of count sketches. Later research works generalized it to a much larger class of dimensionality reductions via Tensor random embeddings. Tensor random embeddings were introduced in 2010 in a paperKasiviswanathan, Shiva Prasad, et al. \\"The price of privately releasing contingency tables and the spectra of random matrices with correlated rows.\\" Proceedings of the forty-second ACM symposium on Theory of computing. 2010. on differential privacy and were first analyzed by Rudelson et al. in 2012 in the context of sparse recovery.Rudelson, Mark, and Shuheng Zhou. \\"Reconstruction from anisotropic random measurements.\\" Conference on Learning Theory. 2012. Avron et al. were the first to study the subspace embedding properties of tensor sketches, particularly focused on applications to polynomial kernels. In this context, the sketch is required not only to preserve the norm of each individual vector with a certain probability but to preserve the norm of all vectors in each individual linear subspace. This is a much stronger property, and it requires larger sketch sizes, but it allows the kernel methods to be used very broadly as explored in the book by David Woodruff. Tensor random projections The face-splitting product is defined as the tensor products of the rows (was proposed by V. SlyusarAnna Esteve, Eva Boj & Josep Fortiana (2009): Interaction Terms in Distance-Based Regression, Communications in Statistics ‚Äì Theory and Methods, 38:19, P. 3501 in 1996 for radar and digital antenna array applications). More directly, let \\\\mathbf{C}\\\\in\\\\mathbb R^{3\\\\times 3} and \\\\mathbf{D}\\\\in\\\\mathbb R^{3\\\\times 3} be two matrices. Then the face-splitting product \\\\mathbf{C}\\\\bullet \\\\mathbf{D} is \\\\mathbf{C} \\\\bull \\\\mathbf{D} = \\\\left[ \\\\begin{array} { c } \\\\mathbf{C}_1 \\\\otimes \\\\mathbf{D}_1\\\\hline \\\\mathbf{C}_2 \\\\otimes \\\\mathbf{D}_2\\\\hline \\\\mathbf{C}_3 \\\\otimes \\\\mathbf{D}_3\\\\ \\\\end{array} \\\\right] = \\\\left[ \\\\begin{array} { c c c c c c c c c } \\\\mathbf{C}_{1,1}\\\\mathbf{D}_{1,1} & \\\\mathbf{C}_{1,1}\\\\mathbf{D}_{1,2} & \\\\mathbf{C}_{1,1}\\\\mathbf{D}_{1,3} & \\\\mathbf{C}_{1,2}\\\\mathbf{D}_{1,1} & \\\\mathbf{C}_{1,2}\\\\mathbf{D}_{1,2} & \\\\mathbf{C}_{1,2}\\\\mathbf{D}_{1,3} & \\\\mathbf{C}_{1,3}\\\\mathbf{D}_{1,1} & \\\\mathbf{C}_{1,3}\\\\mathbf{D}_{1,2} & \\\\mathbf{C}_{1,3}\\\\mathbf{D}_{1,3} \\\\hline \\\\mathbf{C}_{2,1}\\\\mathbf{D}_{2,1} & \\\\mathbf{C}_{2,1}\\\\mathbf{D}_{2,2} & \\\\mathbf{C}_{2,1}\\\\mathbf{D}_{2,3} & \\\\mathbf{C}_{2,2}\\\\mathbf{D}_{2,1} & \\\\mathbf{C}_{2,2}\\\\mathbf{D}_{2,2} & \\\\mathbf{C}_{2,2}\\\\mathbf{D}_{2,3} & \\\\mathbf{C}_{2,3}\\\\mathbf{D}_{2,1} & \\\\mathbf{C}_{2,3}\\\\mathbf{D}_{2,2} & \\\\mathbf{C}_{2,3}\\\\mathbf{D}_{2,3} \\\\hline \\\\mathbf{C}_{3,1}\\\\mathbf{D}_{3,1} & \\\\mathbf{C}_{3,1}\\\\mathbf{D}_{3,2} & \\\\mathbf{C}_{3,1}\\\\mathbf{D}_{3,3} & \\\\mathbf{C}_{3,2}\\\\mathbf{D}_{3,1} & \\\\mathbf{C}_{3,2}\\\\mathbf{D}_{3,2} & \\\\mathbf{C}_{3,2}\\\\mathbf{D}_{3,3} & \\\\mathbf{C}_{3,3}\\\\mathbf{D}_{3,1} & \\\\mathbf{C}_{3,3}\\\\mathbf{D}_{3,2} & \\\\mathbf{C}_{3,3}\\\\mathbf{D}_{3,3} \\\\end{array} \\\\right]. The reason this product is useful is the following identity: :(\\\\mathbf{C} \\\\bull \\\\mathbf{D})(x\\\\otimes y) = \\\\mathbf{C}x \\\\circ \\\\mathbf{D} y = \\\\left[ \\\\begin{array} { c } (\\\\mathbf{C}x)_1 (\\\\mathbf{D} y)_1 \\\\ (\\\\mathbf{C}x)_2 (\\\\mathbf{D} y)_2 \\\\ \\\\vdots \\\\end{array}\\\\right], where \\\\circ is the element-wise (Hadamard) product. Since this operation can be computed in linear time, \\\\mathbf{C} \\\\bull \\\\mathbf{D} can be multiplied on vectors with tensor structure much faster than normal matrices. Construction with fast Fourier transform The tensor sketch of Pham and Pagh computes C^{(1)}x \\\\ast C^{(2)}y, where C^{(1)} and C^{(2)} are independent count sketch matrices and \\\\ast is vector convolution. They show that, amazingly, this equals C(x \\\\otimes y) ‚Äì a count sketch of the tensor product! It turns out that this relation can be seen in terms of the face-splitting product as :C^{(1)}x \\\\ast C^{(2)}y = \\\\mathcal F^{-1}(\\\\mathcal F C^{(1)}x \\\\circ \\\\mathcal F C^{(2)}y), where \\\\mathcal F is the Fourier transform matrix. Since \\\\mathcal F is an orthonormal matrix, \\\\mathcal F^{-1} doesn‚Äôt impact the norm of Cx and may be ignored. What‚Äôs left is that C \\\\sim \\\\mathcal C^{(1)} \\\\bullet \\\\mathcal C^{(2)}. On the other hand, :\\\\mathcal F(C^{(1)}x \\\\ast C^{(2)}y) = \\\\mathcal F C^{(1)}x \\\\circ \\\\mathcal F C^{(2)}y= (\\\\mathcal F C^{(1)} \\\\bull \\\\mathcal F C^{(2)})(x \\\\otimes y). Application to general matrices The problem with the original tensor sketch algorithm was that it used count sketch matrices, which aren't always very good dimensionality reductions. In 2020 it was shown that any matrices with random enough independent rows suffice to create a tensor sketch. This allows using matrices with stronger guarantees, such as real Gaussian Johnson Lindenstrauss matrices. In particular, we get the following theorem :Consider a matrix T with i.i.d. rows T_1, \\\\dots, T_m\\\\in \\\\mathbb R^d, such that E[(T_1x)^2]=\\\\x\\\\_2^2 and E[(T_1x)^p]^{1/p} \\\\le \\\\sqrt{ap}\\\\x\\\\_2. Let T^{(1)}, \\\\dots, T^{(c)} be independent comprises of T and M = T^{(1)} \\\\bullet \\\\dots \\\\bullet T^{(c)}. : Then \\\\Mx\\\\_2 - \\\\x\\\\_2 < \\\\varepsilon\\\\x\\\\_2 with probability 1-\\\\delta for any vector x if :m = (4a)^{2c} \\\\varepsilon^{-2} \\\\log1/\\\\delta + (2ae)\\\\varepsilon^{-1}(\\\\log1/\\\\delta)^c. In particular, if the entries of T are \\\\pm1 we get m = O(\\\\varepsilon^{-2}\\\\log1/\\\\delta + \\\\varepsilon^{-1}(\\\\tfrac1c\\\\log1/\\\\delta)^c) which matches the normal Johnson Lindenstrauss theorem of m = O(\\\\varepsilon^{-2}\\\\log1/\\\\delta) when \\\\varepsilon is small. The paper also shows that the dependency on \\\\varepsilon^{-1}(\\\\tfrac1c\\\\log1/\\\\delta)^c is necessary for constructions using tensor randomized projections with Gaussian entries. Variations=Recursive construction Because of the exponential dependency on c in tensor sketches based on the face-splitting product, a different approach was developed in 2020 which applies :M(x\\\\otimes y\\\\otimes\\\\cdots) = M^{(1)}(x \\\\otimes (M^{(2)}y \\\\otimes \\\\cdots)) We can achieve such an M by letting :M = M^{(c)}(M^{(c-1)}\\\\otimes I_d)(M^{(c-2)}\\\\otimes I_{d^2})\\\\cdots(M^{(1)}\\\\otimes I_{d^{c-1}}). With this method, we only apply the general tensor sketch method to order 2 tensors, which avoids the exponential dependency in the number of rows. It can be proved that combining c dimensionality reductions like this only increases \\\\varepsilon by a factor \\\\sqrt{c}. Fast constructions The fast Johnson‚ÄìLindenstrauss transform is a dimensionality reduction matrix Given a matrix M\\\\in\\\\mathbb R^{k\\\\times d}, computing the matrix vector product Mx takes kd time. The Fast Johnson Lindenstrauss Transform (FJLT), was introduced by Ailon and Chazelle in 2006. A version of this method takes M = \\\\operatorname{SHD} where # D is a diagonal matrix where each diagonal entry D_{i,i} is \\\\pm1 independently. The matrix-vector multiplication Dx can be computed in O(d) time. # H is a Hadamard matrix, which allows matrix-vector multiplication in time O(d\\\\log d) # S is a k\\\\times d sampling matrix which is all zeros, except a single 1 in each row. If the diagonal matrix is replaced by one which has a tensor product of \\\\pm1 values on the diagonal, instead of being fully independent, it is possible to compute \\\\operatorname{SHD}(x\\\\otimes y) fast. For an example of this, let \\\\rho,\\\\sigma\\\\in{-1,1}^2 be two independent \\\\pm1 vectors and let D be a diagonal matrix with \\\\rho\\\\otimes\\\\sigma on the diagonal. We can then split up \\\\operatorname{SHD}(x\\\\otimes y) as follows: :\\\\begin{align} &\\\\operatorname{SHD}(x\\\\otimes y) \\\\ &\\\\quad= \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & -1 & 1 & -1 \\\\ 1 & 1 & -1 & -1 \\\\ 1 & -1 & -1 & 1 \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\sigma_1 \\\\rho_1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\\\sigma_1 \\\\rho_2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\\\sigma_2 \\\\rho_1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & \\\\sigma_2 \\\\rho_2 \\\\ \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\begin{bmatrix} x_1y_1 \\\\ x_2y_1 \\\\ x_1y_2 \\\\ x_2y_2 \\\\end{bmatrix} [5pt] &\\\\quad= \\\\left( \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\bullet \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\right) \\\\left( \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & -1 \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\otimes \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & -1 \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\right) \\\\left( \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\sigma_1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\\\sigma_2 \\\\ \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\otimes \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\rho_1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\\\rho_2 \\\\ \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\right) \\\\left( \\\\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\otimes \\\\begin{bmatrix} y_1 \\\\ y_2 \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\right) [5pt] &\\\\quad= \\\\left( \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\bullet \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\right) \\\\left( \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & -1 \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\sigma_1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\\\sigma_2 \\\\ \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\,\\\\otimes\\\\, \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & -1 \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\rho_1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\\\rho_2 \\\\ \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\begin{bmatrix} y_1 \\\\ y_2 \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\right) [5pt] &\\\\quad= \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & -1 \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\sigma_1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\\\sigma_2 \\\\ \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\,\\\\circ\\\\, \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & -1 \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\rho_1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\\\rho_2 \\\\ \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\begin{bmatrix} y_1 \\\\ y_2 \\\\end{bmatrix} . \\\\end{align} In other words, \\\\operatorname{SHD}=S^{(1)}HD^{(1)} \\\\bullet S^{(2)}HD^{(2)}, splits up into two Fast Johnson‚ÄìLindenstrauss transformations, and the total reduction takes time O(d_1\\\\log d_1+d_2\\\\log d_2) rather than d_1 d_2\\\\log(d_1 d_2) as with the direct approach. The same approach can be extended to compute higher degree products, such as \\\\operatorname{SHD}(x\\\\otimes y\\\\otimes z) Ahle et al. shows that if \\\\operatorname{SHD} has \\\\varepsilon^{-2}(\\\\log1/\\\\delta)^{c+1} rows, then operatorname{SHD}x\\\\_2-\\\\x\\\\ \\\\le \\\\varepsilon\\\\x\\\\_2 for any vector x\\\\in\\\\mathbb R^{d^c} with probability 1-\\\\delta, while allowing fast multiplication with degree c tensors. Jin et al.Jin, Ruhui, Tamara G. Kolda, and Rachel Ward. \\"Faster Johnson‚ÄìLindenstrauss Transforms via Kronecker Products.\\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1909.04801 (2019)., the same year, showed a similar result for the more general class of matrices call RIP, which includes the subsampled Hadamard matrices. They showed that these matrices allow splitting into tensors provided the number of rows is \\\\varepsilon^{-2}(\\\\log1/\\\\delta)^{2c-1}\\\\log d. In the case c=2 this matches the previous result. These fast constructions can again be combined with the recursion approach mentioned above, giving the fastest overall tensor sketch. Data aware sketching It is also possible to do so-called \\"data aware\\" tensor sketching. Instead of multiplying a random matrix on the data, the data points are sampled independently with a certain probability depending on the norm of the point. Applications=Explicit polynomial kernels Kernel methods are popular in machine learning as they give the algorithm designed the freedom to design a \\"feature space\\" in which to measure the similarity of their data points. A simple kernel-based binary classifier is based on the following computation: :\\\\hat{y}(\\\\mathbf{x'}) = \\\\sgn \\\\sum_{i=1}^n y_i k(\\\\mathbf{x}_i, \\\\mathbf{x'}), where \\\\mathbf{x}_i\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^d are the data points, y_i is the label of the ith point (either ‚àí1 or +1), and \\\\hat{y}(\\\\mathbf{x'}) is the prediction of the class of \\\\mathbf{x'}. The function k : \\\\mathbb{R}^d \\\\times \\\\mathbb R^d \\\\to \\\\mathbb R is the kernel. Typical examples are the radial basis function kernel, k(x,x') = \\\\exp(-\\\\x-x'\\\\_2^2), and polynomial kernels such as k(x,x') = (1+\\\\langle x, x'\\\\rangle)^2. When used this way, the kernel method is called \\"implicit\\". Sometimes it is faster to do an \\"explicit\\" kernel method, in which a pair of functions f, g : \\\\mathbb{R}^d \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R}^D are found, such that k(x,x') = \\\\langle f(x), g(x')\\\\rangle. This allows the above computation to be expressed as :\\\\hat{y}(\\\\mathbf{x'}) = \\\\sgn \\\\sum_{i=1}^n y_i \\\\langle f(\\\\mathbf{x}_i), g(\\\\mathbf{x'})\\\\rangle = \\\\sgn \\\\left\\\\langle\\\\left(\\\\sum_{i=1}^n y_i f(\\\\mathbf{x}_i)\\\\right), g(\\\\mathbf{x'})\\\\right\\\\rangle, where the value \\\\sum_{i=1}^n y_i f(\\\\mathbf{x}_i) can be computed in advance. The problem with this method is that the feature space can be very large. That is D >> d. For example, for the polynomial kernel k(x,x') = \\\\langle x,x'\\\\rangle^3 we get f(x) = x\\\\otimes x\\\\otimes x and g(x') = x'\\\\otimes x'\\\\otimes x', where \\\\otimes is the tensor product and f(x),g(x')\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^D where D=d^3. If d is already large, D can be much larger than the number of data points (n) and so the explicit method is inefficient. The idea of tensor sketch is that we can compute approximate functions f', g' : \\\\mathbb R^d \\\\to \\\\mathbb R^t where t can even be smaller than d, and which still have the property that \\\\langle f'(x), g'(x')\\\\rangle \\\\approx k(x,x'). This method was shown in 2020 to work even for high degree polynomials and radial basis function kernels. Compressed matrix multiplication Assume we have two large datasets, represented as matrices X, Y\\\\in\\\\mathbb R^{n \\\\times d}, and we want to find the rows i,j with the largest inner products \\\\langle X_i, Y_j\\\\rangle. We could compute Z = X Y^T \\\\in \\\\mathbb R^{n\\\\times n} and simply look at all n^2 posibilities. However, this would take at least n^2 time, and probably closer to n^2d using standard matrix multiplication techniques. The idea of Compressed Matrix Multiplication is the general identity :X Y^T = \\\\sum_{i=1}^d X_i \\\\otimes Y_i where \\\\otimes is the tensor product. Since we can compute a (linear) approximation to X_i \\\\otimes Y_i efficiently, we can sum those up to get an approximation for the complete product. Compact multilinear pooling Tensor sketches can be used to decrease the number of variables needed when implementing Bilinear Pooling in a neural network. Bilinear pooling is the technique of taking two input vectors, x, y from different sources, and using the tensor product x\\\\otimes y as the input layer to a neural network. InGao, Yang, et al. \\"Compact bilinear pooling.\\" Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition. 2016. the authors considered using tensor sketch to reduce the number of variables needed. In 2017 another paperAlgashaam, Faisal M., et al. \\"Multispectral periocular classification with multimodal compact multi-linear pooling.\\" IEEE Access 5 (2017): 14572‚Äì14578. takes the FFT of the input features, before they are combined using the element-wise product. This again corresponds to the original tensor sketch.

Born in the city of Atush in East Turkistan, Hudayar fled to the United States as a political refugee with his family in June 2000. Hudayar founded the East Turkistan National Awakening Movement and has since been leading the movement calling for the \\"restoration of East Turkistan's independence.\\" On November 11, 2019, Hudayar was elected as the Prime Minister of the East Turkistan Government-in-Exile. Hudayar was born in Atush, Xinjiang, China, and studied International Studies and Political Science at the University of Oklahoma and holds American citizenship.  Early life and education Hudayar was born to a Uyghur business family in Atush, Xinjiang, China in 1993. In 1997, shortly after the Ghulja Massacre, Chinese security forces raided his family's home and put a rifle to his head, threatening to kill them after a neighbor reported his uncle for reading an illegal book. A few years later, at the age of 7, Hudayar came to the United States with his family as political refugees. He grew up in Oklahoma and joined the Oklahoma Army National Guard while enrolled in the ROTC program in hopes of becoming a military officer, he was later given medical discharge due to a kidney condition. Hudayar studied International Studies & Political Science at the University of Oklahoma, graduating in January 2017. His Bachelor's senior capstone project was a policy proposal titled \\"From Central Asia to the Uyghurs: Refining the American Grand Strategy.\\" Since 2018, he has been pursuing a Masters in National Security Studies online through the American Military University during his free time. East Turkistan National Awakening Movement In the summer of 2017, Hudayar founded the East Turkistan National Awakening Movement and moved from Oklahoma to Washington, DC to engage in human rights and political advocacy. He is widely known as the Founder and President of the East Turkistan National Awakening Movement. In early 2018, Hudayar began to meet with members of Congress and advocate for the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act and since June 4, 2018, he has led weekly demonstrations in front of the US Capitol building and the White House to protest China's concentration camps. Calling for East Turkistan's Independence With the official public launching of the East Turkistan National Awakening Movement on June 4, 2018, Hudayar has been leading a global movement openly advocating for the \\"restoration of East Turkistan's independence.\\" In September 2019, launched a petition to the White House which got over 108,000 signatures, calling on the US Government to \\"prevent a 21st century Holocaust in East Turkistan\\" and \\"recognize East Turkistan as an Occupied country.\\" On November 13, 2018, Salih Hudayar led hundreds of Uyghurs from the White House to the US Capitol in commemoration of the 85th Anniversary of the First East Turkistan Republic and the 74th Anniversary of the Second East Turkistan Republic's declaration of independence. The demonstrators called on the US Congress to pass a Uyghur Act and called for \\"freedom and independence for East Turkistan.\\" Despite calls for independence being viewed as \\"controversial\\" by other Uyghur groups like the Uyghur American Association, Uyghur Human Rights Project, and the World Uyghur Congress, Hudayar has repeatedly stated that, \\"the only way we [Uyghurs] can ensure our freedoms and human rights is by restoring our independence [independence of East Turkistan] and that‚Äôs the only way we can ensure our overall survival as a whole.\\" In an interview with the Middle East Eye, Hudayar stated that Uyghurs want the United States to understand that the Uyghurs are an occupied people and that the majority of them believe that restoring East Turkistan's independence is the only way forward. On April 9, 2019, Salih Hudayar delivered a speech calling on the Free World to support East Turkistan at the newly launched Committee on the Present Danger China Roundtable. A month later, in May 2019, Hudayar was invited by Frank Gaffney to speak about China's persecution of Uyghur and other Turkic peoples at an event hosted by Save the Persecuted Christians. In July 2019, the East Turkistan National Awakening Movement published 124 coordinates of \\"suspected concentration camps\\" in East Turkistan, Hudayar told the Washington Free Beacon that ETNAM wanted the world to know about these locations as they feared \\"China might be preparing for a 21st Century Holocaust.\\" In October 2019, the Agence France-Presse (AFP) interviewed Salih Hudayar regarding China's destruction of Uyghur graves and cultural sites. Hudayar told the AFP that China was destroying historical sites and cemeteries to disconnect Uyghurs from their history and their ancestors and \\"eradicate any evidence\\" of who the Uyghurs are. In November 2019, Hudayar attended a pro-Hong Kong rally in Washington, DC where he told Voice of America that \\"Uyghurs stand with the people of Hong Kong, and if Hong Kong falls then Hong Kong face the same situation we are going through.\\" On June 6, 2020 he used social media to deliver a fiery speech opposing \\"China's imperialism in East Turkistan, Manchuria, South Mongolia, and Tibet\\" In his speech, he asserted that East Turkistan was an independent country that is currently occupied by China. East Turkistan Government-in-Exile Following Hudayar's speech at the Committee on the Present Danger, the East Turkistan Government-in-Exile appointed Salih Hudayar as their Ambassador to the United States. As Ambassador, Hudayar continued to advocate for Uyghurs' human rights and East Turkistan's independence. In an interview, Hudayar claimed to Fox News that China was harvesting the organs of Uyghurs. On November 11, 2019, Hudayar was elected as Prime Minister of the East Turkistan Government-in-Exile at the 8th General Assembly of the East Turkistan Government-in-Exile. The next day, the East Turkistan National Awakening Movement held a press conference where they released nearly 500 coordinates of suspected concentration camps, prisons, and labor camps. Later that afternoon, Hudayar led a demonstration to commemorate the independence of the former East Turkistan Republics and to bring attention to what he described as a genocide of Uyghurs and other Turkic peoples. In an interview with NPR, Hudayar stated that that Uyghurs and other Turkic peoples in East Turkistan want independence, he also stated that East Turkistan Government in Exile doesn't consider themselves as \\"separatists\\" because they believe that, \\"you can't separate from something you don't belong to.\\" In March 2020, Salih Hudayar led an East Turkistan delegation and held meetings with numerous Senators and Representatives. During his meeting with Representative Ted Yoho, Hudayar asked him to deliver a speech on East Turkistan at the US House of Representatives. Congressman Ted Yoho described East Turkistan as an \\"occupied country\\" and condemned China for its genocide of Uyghurs, Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, and other Turkic peoples. Hudayar condemned the \\"slave labor\\" of Uyghurs and other Turkic peoples and accused China of colonizing East Turkistan and enslaving the Uyghurs and other Turkic peoples. In April 2020, Hudayar appeared as a special guest on Steve Bannon's War Room Pandemic and criticized Muslim countries and leaders for remaining silent to China's atrocities against Turkic Muslims in East Turkistan. ICC Case On July 6, 2020 the East Turkistan Government in Exile (ETGE) and the East Turkistan National Awakening Movement filed a complaint urging the International Criminal Court (ICC) to investigate and prosecute Chinese officials for genocide and crimes against humanity. Salih Hudayar told Radio Free Asia's Chinese service that \\"for too long we have been oppressed by China and its Communist Party and we have suffered so much that the genocide of our people can be no longer ignored.\\" On July 9, 2020, the US Government sanctioned 3 senior Chinese officials including Xinjiang Party Secretary Chen Quanguo and Zhu Hailun who were among the 30 officials mentioned in the complaint to the ICC. Prime Minister Salih Hudayar told Radio Free Asia that the East Turkistan Government in Exile welcomed the sanctions and that Uyghurs wanted real justice. He stated that the Chinese officials should be put on trial like the Nazis during the Nuremberg Trials. Personal life Salih Hudayar is fluent in English, Uyghur, and Turkish. He is married and currently resides with his wife and son in Northern Virginia. Based on his connections with conservative groups, leaders, and media, he is believed to be a conservative.

He spent his early career as a psychology professor, interrupting this to join the United States Army during World War I. He joined the faculty of Yale University in 1925 and studied under the supervision of Robert Yerkes. Yerkes, a psychology professor, had an interest in primates, and Bingham also entered this field. He led a 1929-30 expedition to the Belgian Congo to study gorillas in the wild. Though hampered by the size of the expedition, Bingham managed to get close to several troops of the animals and record details of their behavior. Upon his return to the United States he joined the Civil Works Administration and the Emergency Relief Administration. Bingham later worked with the National Youth Administration and, during World War II, rejoined the US Army. After the war Bingham served as a senior psychologist with the Veterans Administration.  Early life and career  Harold Clyde Bingham was born in Rowan, Iowa, on January 21, 1888. He graduated from Ellsworth College in 1910 and afterwards received a master of arts degree from Harvard University and a doctorate from Johns Hopkins University. Bingham spent a period as professor of education and psychology and track and baseball coach at Ellsworth. Bingham joined the U.S. Army during World War I. In 1920 Bingham became a member of the Research Information Service of the National Research Council. In 1925 he joined the faculty of Wesleyan University as a research associate and associate professor of psychology. He took up the same roles at Yale University in 1925 and held them until 1930. While at Yale, Bingham was a postdoctoral student of Robert Yerkes, who had an interest in human and primate intelligence. Bingham wrote Sex Development in Apes in 1928.  Congo expedition  In 1929 Bingham was selected as director of a joint Yale and Carnegie Institution for Science expedition to study the mountain gorillas of the Belgian Congo, the first planned study of the species in their natural environment. To prepare, he read the reports of the explorations of Carl Akeley and visited Rosalia Abreu's primate collection in Cuba. Bingham's wife, Lucille, accompanied him on the expedition, which left the United States later in 1929. Bingham's expedition focused on the Albert National Park. In common with many early expeditions, the number of porters accompanying the group hampered the study by scaring away the gorillas. Bingham did, however succeed in trailing several different troops of gorillas, including one that he stayed with for 100 hours. Bingham reported that the gorillas were largely terrestrial, though did occasionally climb trees, and that they avoided water as a rule but did cross small streams. He noted that they moved around constantly to forage for food and slept only one night in each nest. Bingham did not observe any use of sticks as tools by the animals, which had been reported in captivity. Bingham drew up a list of food the gorillas ate and the vocalizations they used. The expedition ended in 1930, and he wrote a book Gorillas in a Native Habitat in 1932.  Later life  In 1931 Bingham was appointed a supervisor of research and director of education at the Civil Works Administration and the Emergency Relief Administration in New Hampshire. They were New Deal works programs established by Franklin D. Roosevelt. In 1934 he transferred to the National Youth Administration as a director. Bingham held this position until 1941 when he rejoined the army for World War II. He joined the Veterans Administration as a senior psychologist in Washington, D.C., in 1946 and also worked as a senior adviser and guidance officer, before his retirement in 1955. Bingham was a member of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and a fellow of the American Psychological Association. He died in Laconia, New Hampshire, on August 26, 1964.

Upon graduation, he continued to read for his Doctor of Philosophy degree on Matrix isolation infra-red and mass spectrometric studies of some arsenic and selenium oxides and successfully gained his PhD in 1988.  Research and career  Upon completing his PhD, Brisdon worked for one year on a UKEA (Winfrith) funded project investigating on design, construction and testing of systems for sampling directly from a reaction chamber at or above atmospheric pressures and at high temperatures. He then completed his postdoctoral research at University of Leicester where he worked on synthesis of high oxidation-state transition metal fluorides and oxide-fluorides via high pressure and liquid fluorine syntheses and on the fluorination of the fullerene's, C60and C70. He then joined the University of Manchester as a Lecturer and was later on promoted to the position of Senior Lecturer. Brisdon's research in general is based on fluorine chemistry, including on HCFCs, fluorine-containing organometallic systems, fluorophosphines and fluorine-containing materials, such as ionic liquids and fluorographenes. Brisdon is the current Director of Teaching and Learning at Apart from research and lecturing in the Department of Chemistry at The University of Manchester. He also is a highly regarded member of the Fluorine Groups in the Royal Society of Chemistry as well as the American Chemical Society and is also part of the editorial board in the Journal of Fluorine Chemistry.  Notable work  Brisdon is the author of Inorganic Spectroscopic Methods, a book which elaborates and discusses several spectroscopic techniques that can be used in inorganic chemistry,including vibrational spectroscopy, resonance spectroscopy, UV/Vis Spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. In 2014, Brisdon also participated in a research which showed how the use of 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol as solvent would be able to improve the efficiency of gold catalyzed A3-reactions. The research also showed that the rate of the reaction can be accelerated by the use of a microwave reactor. In 2001, Brisdon also reported on the synthesis of new fluorovinyl-containing organometallic complexes and fluorovinyl-containing phosphine ligands of the type RnP(CX=CF2)3-n(n =1, 2; X = Cl, F) and their complexes. The research showed how HFC-134a and HCFC-133a with two equivalents of butyllithium can form fluorovinyllithium reagents (CF2=CFLi and CF2=CClLi). These reagents were then used to synthesize these new novel fluorovinyl-containing transition metal and main-group compounds.
