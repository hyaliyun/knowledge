Early life and education Appleyard was born in Bramley, Leeds, West Yorkshire, the son of John Ernest Appleyard, a successful motor engineer, and Mary Elizabeth Northrop. His brother Ian became a successful rally driver. Geoffrey grew up in Linton, West Yorkshire, and was educated at Bootham School in York, where he combined academic success with natural history and roof-climbing, and at Caius College, Cambridge, where he obtained a first in Engineering and a skiing blue, while he was also his college's Captain of Boats, and competed as a highly successful international skier. Military service Appleyard was commissioned into the Royal Army Service Corps (Supplementary Reserve) on 1 April 1939 with the rank of Second Lieutenant. Mobilized for active service on 24 August 1939, he commanded an RASC mobile motor repair workshop as part of the British Expeditionary Force in northern France. During the Battle of France he was ordered to destroy all his vehicles, and then was evacuated from Dunkirk. Appleyard volunteered to join the Commandos in late 1940, and was posted to B Troop, No. 7 Commando. He was promoted to the war substantive rank of Lieutenant on 1 January 1941, and in May 1941, now an acting Captain, was awarded the Military Cross for his \\"gallant and distinguished services in the field\\". after taking part in an operation by boat and submarine to pick up two Operation Savanna agents on the coast of France and bring them back to England. Appleyard then served aboard the ketch-rigged Brixham trawler Maid Honor which sailed to the coast of West Africa, spending six months reporting on enemy submarine activity and carrying out clandestine raids. The highlight of the assignment was \\"Operation Postmaster\\", in which the Italian liner Duchessa d'Aosta and the German tug Likomba were boarded and towed from the neutral Spanish island of Fernando Po and taken to Nigeria. On his return he was awarded a bar to his Military Cross. After the success of \\"Postmaster\\" the \\"Maid Honor Force\\" was expanded (though it never numbered more than 55 men at any time) and renamed the \\"Small Scale Raiding Force\\", though its official designation was No. 62 Commando, under the operational control of Combined Operations Headquarters. Appleyard took part in many SSRF raids on the coast of occupied France, landing in small boats from motor launches, compelling the Germans to reinforce their defences along hundreds of miles of coastline, and diverting significant numbers of troops from combat duties elsewhere. However, an injury prevented him from going ashore in the disastrous \\"Operation Aquatint\\", on 12 September 1942, when an attack at Sainte-Honorine-des-Pertes, Normandy, went badly wrong and half the 10-man force were captured, and the other half killed, including the SSRF's commanding officer Major Gustavus March-Phillipps. Its failure stemmed in part from Appleyard mistaking the landing beach, though he never knew that. Appleyard took command of the SSRF, and led 10 men of the SSRF and No. 12 Commando, on \\"Operation Basalt\\", landing on the Channel island of Sark on the night of 3/4 October 1942. Five Germans were taken prisoner, but when one shouted a warning he was shot dead. With the enemy now alerted, the raiders returned to the beach with the remaining four prisoners. En route, three of them attempted to escape and were killed. As a result, an enraged Hitler issued the infamous Kommandobefehl (\\"Commando Order\\"), stating that all captured Commandos were to be shot without exception. Further operations followed, and on 15 December 1942 Appleyard was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO). On meeting the now Temporary Major Appleyard at his third investiture in eleven months, the King was both amused and impressed, greeting him with: \\"What, you again?\\" Death The SSRF was disbanded in April 1943, but many of its members were transferred to Algeria, where they formed the nucleus of Bill Stirling's new 2nd Special Air Service Regiment, of which Appleyard was appointed second-in-command. On the night of 12/13 July 1943, during the Allied invasion of Sicily, Appleyard supervised the dropping of a group of SAS paratroopers north of Randazzo in \\"Operation Chestnut\\". The Albemarle aircraft disappeared on the return flight over the Mediterranean, and Appleyard was declared missing presumed dead. It had probably been shot down by friendly fire. He is commemorated at the Cassino Memorial. Describing him, Vladimir \\"Popski\\" Peniakoff said, \\"He was one of the few officers who had developed the technique of the small scale raid: the care he took of his men made him stand out among brother officers who were too excited by the prospect of adventure to think of anybody but their own selves.\\" References ;Notes ;Bibliography * * Category:1916 births Category:1943 deaths Category:People educated at Bootham School Category:Alumni of Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge Category:Royal Army Service Corps officers Category:British Army Commandos officers Category:Special Air Service officers Category:British Army personnel of World War II Category:British military personnel killed in World War II Category:Companions of the Distinguished Service Order Category:Recipients of the Military Cross Category:People lost at sea Category:Missing in action of World War II Category:Military personnel killed by friendly fire ","title":"Geoffrey Appleyard"},{"id":"13432516","text":"Arthur Eugene Schott (July 14, 1913 ‚Äì November 16, 1992) was an American Major League Baseball pitcher from 1935 to 1939, primarily for the Cincinnati Reds.

The second ship to be named Pivot by the Navy, AM‚Äì463 was laid down 31 March 1952 by Wilmington Boat Works, Wilmington, California; launched 9 January 1954; sponsored by Mrs. Minor C. Heinl; and commissioned 12 July 1954, Lt. Robert M. Collins in command.  West Coast operations  Following shakedown in the Long Beach-San Diego area, Pivot became flagship of Mine Division 93 at its establishment 6 December. On 8 January 1955, she participated in Operation Rainbow to begin her career in the U.S. Pacific Fleet and the following month was redesignated MSO‚Äì463.  WestPac deployments  She operated along the U.S. West Coast until departing Long Beach, California, 2 June 1958 for the Far East for service with the U.S. 7th Fleet. During this deployment she attempted to assist aground at Naruto Kaikyo, Japan; but ran aground herself during the daring operation in dangerous waters. Pivot managed to break free but Prestige was lost.  Awarded the Battle Efficiency ‚ÄúE‚Äù  Returning to Long Beach 7 January 1959, the non-magnetic ocean minesweeper resumed operations along the U.S. West Coast establishing a pattern of alternating service off the Pacific seaboard with WestPac deployments in 1960, 1962, 1964, 1966 and 1968. During the 1962 deployment, she received the Battle Efficiency ‚ÄúE‚Äù.

Her light draft, and her crew‚Äôs high standard of seamanship suited the minesweeper ideally for this important service in support of freedom. Pivot's last WESTPAC deployment, during which she served in Operation Market Time, first at the mouth of the Mekong River and then along the DMZ, was from February to September, 1970. Pivot was decommissioned on 1 July 1971. Stricken from the Navy list 1 August 1974. She was sold to Spain effective the same day. Pivot was named Guadamedina (M42) in the Spanish Navy.

Informally, determining the centroid is often described as finding the point upon which the shape (cut from a uniform plane) would balance. This method is also sometimes described as the \\"gravitational method\\". One example of a refined approach using an azimuthal equidistant projection, also potentially incorporating an iterative process, was described by Peter A. Rogerson in 2015. The abstract says \\"the new method minimizes the sum of squared great circle distances from all points in the region to the center\\". However, as that property is also true of a centroid (of area), this aspect is effectively just different terminology for determining the centroid. In 2019, New Zealand's GNS Science also used an iterative approach (and a variety of different projections) when determining a centre position for New Zealand's Extended Continental Shelf. However, other methods have also been proposed or used to determine the centres of various countries and regions. These include: * centroid of volume (incorporating elevations into calculations), instead of the more usual centroid of area as described above. * centre point of a bounding box completely enclosing the area. While relatively easy to determine, a centre point calculated using this method will generally also vary (relative to the shape of the landmass or region) depending on the orientation of the bounding box to the area under consideration. In this sense it is not a robust method. * finding the longitude that divides the region into two equal area parts to the east and west, and then similarly the latitude that divides the region into two equal area parts to the north and south. Like the bounding box approach described above this method would not generally locate precisely the same point if the same shaped region was oriented differently. As noted in a United States Geological Survey document, \\"There is no generally accepted definition of geographic center, and no completely satisfactory method for determining it.\\" In general, there is room for debate around various details such as whether or not to include islands and similarly, large bodies of water, how best to handle the curvature of the Earth (a more significant factor with larger regions) and closely related to that issue, which map projection to use.

It was the first American film to deal with the 1947‚Äì1948 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine and marked the first significant feature film role for Jeff Chandler. Plot Freighter owner and captain Mike Dillon (Dana Andrews) reluctantly smuggles Jewish immigrants into Palestine, making it very clear to the Jewish leader, David Vogel (Stephen McNally), he is only doing it for the money. Dillon is annoyed to learn that he will have to go ashore to get paid the eight thousand U.S. dollars he is owed. When a British patrol boat arrives sooner than expected, Dillon is forced to join the Jews in their flight for freedom. There are casualties on both sides before the refugees get away, including one of Dillon's men.

Bucker later expanded this into a short story about Christmas in Palestine as experienced by a visiting American. In the 1940s he expanded this into a novel, then a screenplay, originally called Night Watch, then later Desert Legion. Stephen McNally was originally supposed to play the American pilot, while Paul Christian was to play a Palestinian Jewish leader. However Christian had to drop out due to an eye infection, McNally took over his role, and Dana Andrews played McNally's part. (Dick Powell had also been considered for the role of the American.) Ann Blyth was intended to play the female lead. Bucker was originally announced as director, but George Sherman took over that task. Blyth was reassigned by Universal to Come Be My Love and the female lead given instead to M√§rta Tor√©n. Jeff Chandler was cast in February 1949. The role was originally intended for an older actor but was reconfigured once Chandler was cast. Production took place on Universal's backlot with location work at Monterey, California, the San Fernando Valley and Victorville in the Mojave Desert. Even during filming, there was an expectation that the film would be controversial because it showed Jewish settlers fighting the British and not Arabs. Universal barred reporters from the set during the last week of filming because several London papers had carried adverse articles on the project. Controversy on release in Britain and Australia The Evening Standard claimed that the film was \\"not for the eyes of Britons\\" and the Daily Telegraph insisted that British audiences would be surprised to see the unwonted harshness with which the British troops in the film treated Jewish civilians. There were demonstrations and disturbances outside the New Gallery cinema, near Piccadilly in London, when the film opened there on 2 February 1950, and pamphlets supporting Oswald Mosley's fascist Union Movement were distributed to people wanting to see it. The cinema also received a bomb threat. Mosley threatened to picket other cinemas that showed the film. Five days later, the Public Control Committee of London Country Council followed the advice of the Home Office and prohibited further public showings of the film in order to prevent further scenes of rowdiness by fascist elements. It ignored a protest from the National Council for Civil Liberties, which claimed that its action constituted a ban on free speech. The film was screened in Australia after some cuts, but was not shown in Tasmania because of its controversial content.

Her first on-screen appearance was in the episode \\"Four Months Later...\\", though the character was featured earlier in the graphic novel \\"Maya y Alejandro\\". Character overview=Generations Maya and her twin brother Alejandro are fugitives wanted for murder. In \\"Four Months Ago...\\", it is revealed she killed all of the people who attended her brother's wedding, except Alejandro, with her power. This happened when Maya discovered the bride was having an affair with a former lover, and the man threatened her, causing enough stress to activate her powers in her native Dominican Republic. She then became a nun and went to a convent in Venezuela to pray for God to help her. However, her brother found her and brought the police. Again stressed at the possibility of imprisonment, her power activated, but Alejandro, using his own power, stopped the damage and fled with her. After discovering Chandra Suresh's book, they decided to go to New York City to find him, not knowing of his death. When Alejandro was kicked out of one transport they found, it results in the death of the occupants. In \\"Lizards\\", Maya and Alejandro make it to the Guatemala-Mexico border where they meet with Nidia, a woman who they knew in their childhood and who arranged for them to sneak across the border. While resting at Nidia's, an unnamed curandera tells Maya that she is cursed with a horrible, incurable darkness, which she says could even kill the Devil; the healer then runs away in fear. While crossing the border, Alejandro gets separated from Nidia and Maya, who both make it across. Maya accidentally uses her power on Nidia, but Alejandro comes back in time to halt the effect allowing Nidia to recover. Nidia then runs away, saying that the twins are cursed, leaving the pair alone in Mexico. In \\"Kindred\\", the twins are still on the run. Alejandro is arrested during an attempted car theft and imprisoned. Maya comes to his rescue by initiating her power and poisoning everyone in the building. Once freed Alejandro stops the effect and an American prisoner named Derek offers them a ride in exchange for helping him escape. In \\"The Kindness of Strangers\\", Maya and Alejandro continue to travel with Derek to the United States. While traveling along a barren road they meet up with Sylar, who has collapsed from exhaustion. Sylar tells them his real name, Gabriel, and offers to help them find Chandra Suresh. After reaching a town Derek discovers Maya and Alejandro are wanted criminals and tells it to Sylar. Sylar kills him and drives off with Maya and Alejandro in the car, telling them that Derek is calling the police. In \\"The Line\\", Sylar tries to convince Maya that her power is a gift. They discover an apparently unguarded crossing on the border and drive through. However, they are immediately surrounded by armed men demanding they exit the vehicle. Against Alejandro's protests, Sylar convinces Maya to use her ability to kill the men and escape. Maya is later excoriated by Alejandro, who says Sylar can't be trusted and that because of what she did back at the border, she really is a murderer now. In \\"Truth and Consequences\\", Sylar provokes Maya into using her power in order to learn to control it. For the first time, Maya is able to control her ability and prevent Sylar from dying. Alejandro again warns Maya, showing her an article off the internet that says Sylar killed his mother. When confronted, Sylar confesses to killing his mother, saying it was an accident. In saying so Maya feels they have an even greater understanding. Sylar succeeds in driving a wedge between the siblings, as Maya identifies with Sylar as a fellow accidental killer. When Alejandro privately confronts Sylar in his hotel room over Sylar's intention to take Maya, Sylar kills him. When Maya knocks on the door, Sylar pretends to have gotten out of the shower and answers the door, blocking Maya's view of the room. As they talk, the two draw closer, and slowly kiss. While Maya is distracted, Sylar closes the door behind him. In \\"Powerless\\", Maya and Sylar successfully reach Mohinder Suresh in New York. Sylar shoots Maya after she finds out the truth about him and that he killed Alejandro. She is brought back to life by Mohinder by one of the two blood samples meant for Niki Sanders. The other vial is then taken by Sylar, who uses it to regain his own powers and cure the virus. Villains In \\"The Second Coming\\", Mohinder discovers the source of the powers due to the way Maya's power works. By taking a sample of fluid from her adrenal glands, he is able to inject himself and gain a power of his own. This power is different from Maya's because it is influenced by blood chemistry. In \\"The Butterfly Effect\\" she begins to have a sexual relationship with Mohinder. Soon after, however, she discovers the people that Mohinder has kidnapped, and, upon being discovered, is wrapped in a cocoon and stuck to the wall herself. In the episode \\"Dying of the Light\\", Mohinder confesses to Tracy (whom he kidnaps along with Nathan) that Maya was right, that he is a monster. In \\"Eris Quod Sum\\", Maya is taken to Pinehearst Industries by Mohinder. There, she has her ability absorbed by Arthur Petrelli. Upon learning this, she is relieved to be free of her power, which she considered a curse. When she is released, she is still wary of Mohinder, who has admitted to having genuine feelings for her. She tells him that he had no right to conduct his experiments and crimes in her name and that she no longer trusts him. She adds that she needs to make amends for her sins and hopes he will get well. She is then seen with her belongings‚Äîan American passport, credit card, and money‚Äîleaving Pinehearst. In \\"The Eclipse\\", the temporarily depowered Mohinder escapes from Pinehearst and goes to visit her, but he immediately leaves just as she opens the door when his powers (and mutation) return. Fugitives In \\"Libertad\\", she is sent by \\"Rebel\\" to \\"Angry Skunk\\", a bar that also helps fugitive posthumans, to obtain a new ID and resources to escape DHS's agents. Misha and his associate are reluctant at first, especially when they notice Maya has no power. They finally agree to meet Maya at the bar at 11:00 pm to give her a new ID. Later that night, Misha is caught by the agents and ends up revealing the meeting point. \\"Rebel\\" manages to warn Angie, Harmon and Maya. After considering themselves doomed, the trio decides to escape in different ways. Although the negative current situation, \\"Rebel\\" makes her believe in hope, as he ensures his help to Maya while hidden in the dark avoiding the oncoming agents. Powers and abilities Maya's black tears. Maya's ability creates a fast-acting and potentially fatal poison in any human being nearby. The ability is triggered when she is stressed, but she can willingly activate her power if she wishes. Impediments such as walls or sealed vehicles don't affect the range or speed of infection. When Maya's ability activates, her eyes turn completely black and \\"black tears\\" are emitted from her eyes. Anyone within a certain distance of her (the range varies considerably, from an entire street full of people to the area of a small building) quickly exhibits similar symptoms and loses consciousness almost immediately, followed shortly by death. Initially, Maya needs the help of her brother Alejandro to deactivate her power. His power also acts as a cure to the poison she creates, as well as making him immune to its effects. With Sylar's help, Maya eventually learns to deactivate her own power, eliminating the need for Alejandro's intervention to control it. In \\"Eris Quod Sum\\", her power is removed completely by Arthur Petrelli.

Life He was born in Bombay (now Mumbai), India, to Goan parents. He took up guitar in his teens, influenced by American jazz guitarists such as Charlie Christian and Wes Montgomery whom he heard on the radio, and soon began performing with local jazz groups. By his early 20s he had formed his own group, including saxophonist Braz Gonzalvez and pianist Anacleto Naronha, and toured around India. He met his future wife Joyce, an Irish-born teacher, in Simla. He gained such a reputation as a musician that the then Maharani of Jaipur, an ardent jazz lover, became his benefactor and bought him his first quality guitar, a Gibson.Goan Voice UK: supplement on :AMANCIO D'SILVA In 1967, he travelled to London with his family, primarily to seek medical treatment for his son Stephano. He and Joyce had two other children, Maria and Francesca. He worked as a cleaner, and also as a musician at the \\"Prospect of Whitby\\" pub and at the Spanish Garden Club in the West End, and began living in Ealing. Jonathan Miller introduced him to record producer Dennis Preston, who set up a collaboration between D'Silva and leading British musicians Don Rendell and Ian Carr. This resulted in the EMI album Integration...introducing Amancio D‚ÄôSilva, which received critical acclaim as a unique fusion of jazz and Indian music styles.Home The next collaboration, in 1969, was the album Hum Dono with Jamaican-born saxophonist Joe Harriott, for which Amancio wrote the majority of the compositions, and which again met with critical support. This was followed by Reflections...the romantic guitar of Amancio D‚ÄôSilva (1971), featuring orchestral arrangements by Stan Tracey of classic songs by Gershwin, Ellington and others. In 1972 he led an outfit on the album Dream Sequence, by Cosmic Eye, an avant garde group including Alan Branscombe, Kashev Sathe, and John Mayer. Other collaborations around the same time included two albums with percussionist Guy Warren, all listed below. Amancio continued to perform, and record independently, new music with collaborators from the EMI albums and others. These included projects with Clem Alford, but also with the flautist/saxophonist Lynn Dobson amongst others. Living in Essex in the 1980s, he would play regularly at jazz clubs in Ipswich, as well as a series of concerts at St. Mary's Arts Centre in Colchester around 1985, which featured amongst others Marcio Mattos on double bass, and also concerts at Norwich Arts Centre. As well as performing and recording extensively, Amancio also customised guitar pick-ups for well known rock musicians. He continued to perform until his health made it impossible in the mid-1990s, and also taught extensively, first at Jenako Art in London's East End from the mid-1980s to early 1990s and later at the Krishnamurti International School in Hampshire. In 1992 he was partially paralysed by a stroke. He and Joyce D'Silva remained married throughout his life. He died in 1996 following further strokes, and was buried according to his wishes at a woodland cemetery near Brighton.

She is a young woman in her early 20s from New Orleans, and she has the power to mimic any physical motion she witnesses.  Character concept  Monica Dawson was one of many new characters to join the second season of the series. She is the first cousin of Micah Sanders and niece of D. L. Hawkins. She also has a younger brother named Damon. She lives with her grandmother, Nana Dawson, who takes on responsibility of caregiver to Monica and her brother. Monica and the Dawson family live in New Orleans, which was heavily flooded as a result of Hurricane Katrina. It is known that her mother was killed during the devastation of Katrina.TV Guide TV Guide describes Monica as \\"an avenging angel intent on bringing justice to prevalent corruption,\\" presumably inspired by the death of her mother. Her family home was flooded, leaving her family with financial difficulties in addition to the sudden loss of her mother. She works hard to support her brother and grandmother (played by Nichelle Nichols). Furthermore, she has to deal with the implications of discovering she has a special ability. \\"She's a good girl with a good heart who has had her life taken from her, and she's looking for a way out.\\"Sci-Fi central season preview She adopts the role of surrogate caregiver to Niki and D.L.'s son Micah, who lives with the Dawson family during the second season. Characteristics Description of the character personality is scarce, although the show's writers have described her as an \\"extremely kind young hero, and one to willingly give up everything to help the people close to her.\\" She is also one of the very few characters who like having their abilities. Appearances=Generations Monica speaks with Nana, Damon, and her cousin Micah before going to work. Just before she leaves, she sees a television program about cutting tomato roses. At Burger Bonanza, she talks with Camille about her frustrations with home and work. As she talks, she absentmindedly cuts a tomato rose, just as she'd seen the cooking show host do earlier. At home for dinner, Monica sees that Damon is watching a pay-per-view show called WrestleMania 22. Micah admits that he used his power to rig the TV so they could watch without paying, and this makes Monica angry. She witnesses Rey Mysterio perform the 619 (a wrestling move also known as Tiger feint kick) on Randy Orton before heading back to work, where she is supposed to close the store at the end of the day. Back at the restaurant, Monica tries to lock the front door, but a man forces his way in and draws a gun on her. As the man robs the cash register, Monica performs 619 in the same way she saw Rey Mysterio, and she sends the robber through a glass partition. Monica finds Micah playing the piano. She mimics Micah's piano-playing without realizing she is doing so until Micah points it out. Because of her surprise at this, Micah realizes that she is a muscle mimic like a female crimefighter in the 9th Wonders! comic named St. Joan. He tells her this, also revealing his own ability and that of his father. The two go out to test her ability and agree to keep it a secret between them. After they return, Monica answers a knock at the door and finds Mohinder standing on the other side. Mohinder tests Monica's ability at the Company's hospital. Under Bob's instructions, Mohinder comes up to Monica with a syringe containing the new variant of the Shanti virus, telling Monica it's standard procedure. Mohinder decides against it and leaves the room. Later, Bob brings Monica to her home and gives her a cover story for her absence, a list of contact information, and a video iPod. The iPod contains footage of many different physical skills for her to learn using her ability. After her brother gets Micah's backpack stolen, including his comics and his father's medal, Monica tells Micah she knows where the thief lives and takes Micah there. Disguising herself in a black hood, Monica watches a video of parkour on the iPod Bob gave her, then she breaks into the deserted house and easily finds Micah's things. However, the teen and his gang members return. Finding her, they capture her and throw her into the back of a van. As seen in \\"Powerless\\", she is taken to an abandoned building and tied up. The gang starts spreading gasoline all over the floor to ignite the building. Monica manages to get her phone out of her pocket and turn it on. Using Micah's ability, Niki is able to track Monica's cell phone and find her. She enters the burning building, unties Monica, and helps her escape. However, the building explodes with Niki in it. Scenes with Monica in the third season were filmed, but were cut.http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id;=18281 Fugitives Monica watches over New Orleans. Monica is seen again in \\"Rebellion, Part 1: Rebel Yell\\", where she has assumed the responsibility to watch New Orleans with the help of Micah, using her abilities and becoming \\"Saint Joan\\" herself, according to Micah. After a heavily acrobatic escape, she is taken by DHS agents. Later, Micah enters the government's network and finds Monica to be listed as a \\"passenger\\" in the posthumans' flight in \\"A Clear and Present Danger\\". At the hangar, she was hooded, drugged and wore an orange jumpsuit. By the time the plane crashes, her status is unknown (it's also discovered that Nana was also on the plane). In \\"Rebellion, Part 7: The Liberation Of Saint Joan\\", Monica is finally located by the \\"Rebellion\\" team in an abandoned hospital in Washington D.C., where Abigail and West stopped a doctor from experimenting on her. Once saved, she is told Micah has gone (I Am Sylar), so they search for him with Lee and Sparrow. In \\"Ice Queen, Part 1\\", Micah states that he has already reunited with Monica and the \\"Rebellion\\" team before the beginning of Redemption.  Powers and abilities  Monica acquiring new skills. Monica has the power of adoptive muscle memory, or photographic reflexes, which allows her to replicate any physical motion she witnesses without having to practice it. For example, in \\"The Kindness of Strangers\\", she creates a tomato rose after glancing at a cooking show her grandmother was watching. Later on, she stops a robber with a wrestling move that she saw during a match on TV. In the following episode, Micah helps her hone her powers, and she learns piano, Double-Dutch, and martial arts from a movie. She learns gymnastics while with the Company during the episode \\"The Line\\", and Bob gives her an iPod loaded with video demonstrations of any skill she wants to learn. Her powers only allow her to duplicate what she is physically capable of doing; she cannot duplicate the powers of other evolved humans.

Anglo-American law generally requires a corporate body to seek official government sanction, usually in the form of a charter, in order to operate. Such chartered bodies normally authenticate their official acts by marking them with a distinctive seal. The seal's design is usually complicated to avoid counterfeiting, but it can also express something about the institution's history or mission. Dartmouth College is one such chartered body, and it obtained its official seal in 1773.  Design and creation  Dartmouth College received a royal charter on December 13, 1769 through New Hampshire's colonial governor John Wentworth. The charter required a seal that was to be: Nevertheless, on March 13, 1770, founder Eleazar Wheelock wrote to the trustees of the English fund that was supporting the College (rather than the American trustees of the institution itself, as the charter stipulated) to suggest that his: The Seal as engraved on the exterior of Rollins Chapel The English trustees, including Lord Dartmouth, did not take up the suggestion. Evidence exists that they were annoyed with Wheelock's acquisition of a charter for a college; they were under the impression that the funds under their control were to be used to support Wheelock's efforts at educating and Christianizing Native Americans at Moor's Indian Charity School at Lebanon, Connecticut. Wheelock then designed a seal for his college bearing a striking resemblance to the seal of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, a missionary society founded in London in 1701, in order to maintain the illusion that his college was more for mission work than for higher education. Wheelock arranged for Nathaniel Hurd, a Boston silversmith, to engrave the seal. Hurd had engraved many coats of arms and appears in a John Singleton Copley portrait of ca. 1765 with two books, one of which is A Display of Heraldry by John Guillim (1610). Wheelock wrote to Governor Wentworth on May 22, 1772, saying \\"I hope that Mr Hurd will have the College Seal compleated by Commencement.\\" The seal (a single-sided \\"female\\" die used to form impressions in wax) was ready by Commencement of 1773, and Portsmouth resident and former Chief Justice and Treasurer of the Province of New Hampshire George Jaffrey donated it to the College. The trustees officially accepted the seal on August 25, 1773, describing it as:  History and revisions  The Seal as engraved in Collis Commonground, originally known as Commons Former College Librarian William Woodward hid the seal from Dartmouth's officers along with the charter and four account books after the state of New Hampshire purported to take over the operation of Dartmouth College (and purported to make Woodward Treasurer of Dartmouth University). The Dartmouth College Case named Woodward as the defendant and technically sought to recover the items that he had hidden. The College's success in the Supreme Court returned the seal to its possession and extinguished the University. In 1876, the College switched from having its seal impress wax to having it impress paper. This required a second, \\"male\\" die to fit under the original. The seal design was also carved in sandstone on the exterior of Rollins Chapel in 1886 (see above) and in wood on the interior of Commons in the Collis Center in 1901 (see right). On October 28, 1926, the trustees affirmed the charter's reservation of the seal for official corporate documents alone. The College Publications Committee under Ray Nash commissioned typographer W. A. Dwiggins to create a line-drawing version of the seal in 1940 that saw widespread use. Dwiggins' design was modified during 1957 to change the date from \\"1770\\" to \\"1769,\\" to accord with the date of the College Charter. The trustees commissioned a new set of dies with a date of \\"1769\\" to replace the old dies, now badly worn after almost two hundred years of use. The 1957 design continues to be used under trademark number 2305032.

By the late 1950s, it became common for the loser to have to remove an item of clothing. Yaky≈´ken gets its name from a Shikoku chant which is still a local performance art today.http://mw.nikkei.com/sp/#!/article/DGXNASFG230DO_V20C14A6BC8000/ It is quite common to see yaky≈´ken on Japanese television variety shows especially at New Years. Origin The term initially originated from a Shikoku baseball game in October 1924, between the local teams of Ehime and Kagawa. The Ehime team lost the game 6‚Äì0, and its manager, senry≈´ poet , improvized a cheerleading dance from the tune of classical kabuki to boost the morale of his humiliated team. This dance later became an iconic feature of the Ehime team. In 1954, singers like and from King, and from Nippon Columbia, and from Victor Japan each adapted the dance and its lyrics into record singles named \\"Yakyuken\\" (lit. \\"baseball fist\\"), and the term quickly became known nationwide. In 1966, the city of Matsuyama, where the cheerleading dance originated, introduced it as a representative taiko dance for Matsuyama in Shikoku's annual August banquet. In 1970, the banquet dance was transformed into the more popular sansukumi-ken parlour game that continued to today, which the Matsuyama people regarded as honke (lit. \\"senior branch\\" or \\"orthodox\\") yaky≈´ken. Strip sansukumi-ken, however, had been a popular activity in the Japanese red-light district since late Edo period. In 1969, Nippon TV introduced a skit as part of its hugely popular owarai variety show by comedians Kinichi Hagimoto and Jir≈ç Sakagami, where beautiful female guests were invited to play sansukumi-ken on stage, and the loser would undress and auction off her clothes to the studio audience for charity. This skit was successful enough in terms of ratings, that later in the year it became its own separate show called , named such as Hagimoto was a keen baseball fan. Yaky≈´ken came to associated with strip games. Because of this, Hagimoto himself personally visited Matsuyama in 2005 and apologized to , the fourth- generation iemoto of honke yaky≈´ken, for unintentionally distorting yaky≈´ken. Yaky≈´ken as a stripping game was further propagated by the prolific Japanese pornographic industry, which often used the yaky≈´ken chant in adult videos. Yaky≈´ken eroge are also popular in Japan and many East Asian countries, with the first yaky≈´ken video game being created by Hudson Soft for the Sharp MZ-80K in 1981.

Homesh First was formed after the homes of the Jewish residents of Homesh were razed and the Jewish community was evicted as part of Israel's disengagement in August 2005. Dagan himself was a resident of Sanur, which was also demolished and evacuated as part of the 2005 disengagement plan. He is married, and father to four small children. He lives in Shavei Shomron, an Israeli settlement to the west of Nablus. He has a master's degree in Law, and is an officer in the IDF reserves. In August 2015, Dagan was elected as Head of the Shomron Regional Council, replacing Gershon Mesika, who resigned from his post following involvement in a scandal involving Yisrael Beiteinu. He received the support of 63% of the voters in general elections that were held for the Shomron Regional Municipal government on Aug. 6, 2015. Political activism Dagan was active in actions of civil disobedience as a method of protesting the Disengagement Plan. Dagan helped to organize the 2007 Yom Ha'atzmaut march to Homesh. During Sukkot of the same year, Dagan organized a pilgrimage to Homesh. Many former residents and sympathetic Israelis camped out on the grounds where Homesh houses were demolished.http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/870283.html The Christian Science Monitor quoted Dagan as warning against the disengagement: \\"You'll be creating a terror state that would threaten most of the country with Qassam [missiles].\\" In 2013, Dagan helped to spearhead a public relations campaign focused on welcoming Israelis to the West Bank. Dagan hoped to counter what he said were \\"radical left-wing Israeli groups\\" that promote hatred against settlements in Israel and Europe. In January 2015, he became involved in an international incident between the U.S State Department and Israel. In January 2015, Jewish settlers at the Adei Ad illegal outpost threw stones at diplomats from a U.S. delegation who had arrived to inspect vandalism reported at a grove of Palestinian-owned trees in the occupied West Bank. It was reported that recently, settlers were suspected of uprooting thousands of olive tree saplings, some of which had been planted in honor of senior Palestinian official Ziad Abu Ein, who collapsed and died after an altercation with an Israeli soldier. The American consulate came to inspect the grove because some of the land owners claim U.S. citizenship. No injuries were reported. A U.S. State Department spokesman, Jeff Rathke, said, \\"We can confirm a vehicle from the Consulate General was pelted with stones and confronted by a group of armed settlers today in the West Bank, near the Palestinian village of Turmus Ayya.\\" He added that the U.S. is \\"deeply concerned\\" about the attack, and that the Israeli authorities recognize \\"the seriousness of the incident\\". A police spokeswoman said the police were investigating the incident, and no arrests had been made. The U.S. State Department has offered the Israeli authorities a videotape of the incident showing no American drew weapons. Yossi Dagan, in his role as Head of the Shomron Regional Council, urged Interior Minister Gilad Erdan to expel the American delegation, claiming they were spies.  Protest outside Prime Minister's residence  In the end of October 2017 Yossi Dagan, Head of Shomron Regional Council led a three week long protest outside of the Prime Minister's Residence in Jerusalem. The protesters demanded that the government approve with no delay funding to improve roads and security for the settlements in the region. During the last week they declared a hunger strike. On Friday Nov. 9, the group held a press conference on site together with MK David Bitan who represented PM Netanyahu in negotiations, they announced that their demands were accepted and that the PM had signed a letter to the effect.

The second ship to be named Pluck by the Navy, MSO-464, a minesweeper, was laid down 31 March 1952 by Wilmington Boat Works, Inc., Wilmington, California; launched 6 February 1954; sponsored by Mrs. Robert J. Eaton; and commissioned 11 August 1954, Lt. Willis C. McClelland in command.  West Coast operations  Following shakedown, Pluck reported for duty to Commander, Mine Forces, Pacific. She deployed to WestPac in January 1956, and returned in June to Long Beach, California, for overhaul. During January and February 1957 she assisted survey operations in Long Beach Harbor.  Pacific Ocean operations  Assigned to WestPac 2 June 1958, Pluck operated off Taiwan in August and September during the Quemoy crisis. Deployed to WestPac 31 August 1960, she delivered four tons of textbooks to Batangas, Philippines, in January 1961, as part of Operation Handclasp. On her next assignment to WestPac 2 July 1962, Pluck made a good will tour of Mindanao and Panay Islands, Philippines, in September before returning to Long Beach, California. Upon completion of overhaul she rejoined her sister ships at Long Beach 15 October 1963.  Later Pacific Ocean operations  After type training in Hawaiian waters, she deployed to WESTPAC 28 September 1964. During February and March 1965 she monitored coastal shipping off South Vietnam. On her next deployment to WestPac, 16 May 1966, she completed four more coastal patrols beginning July 1966 and ending 2 February 1967. In 1968 she underwent major overhaul from 29 January to 1 July, and, in November, participated in an evaluation of the Red Eye antiaircraft missile. Into 1970 Pluck remained active with the U.S. Pacific Fleet. Originally homeported in Long Beach, California, she was transferred to the Naval Reserve Fleet in July 1972, at which time she changed her homeport to San Diego, California. In 1980 she was drydocked in Long Beach CA and at that time was fitted with a newly developed sonar and GPS system that was very accurate compared to older methods of mine location. The operators of this device often bragged that not only could they find a beer can in 1500 ft of water - they could identify the brand of beer! As a direct result of her new sonar and related computer equipment, in 1981 she was credited with locating and salvaging a luxury yacht that had sunk off the coast of Monterey CA. Into 1988, 1989 and into 1990 Pluck remained active with the Pacific Fleet as a training platform for active duty and reserve personnel. She was decommissioned 29 November 1990 and was stricken from the Navy list 16 January 1991. She was sold for scrapping 1 December 1992. PINS (Precise Integrated Navigation System) was the system that was being tested during this time. The product was created by Magnavox and was thoroughly tested during the early 1980s by the USS Pluck.  Decommissioning  Pluck was decommissioned on 29 November 1990 and was struck from the Navy list on 16 January 1991. She was sold for scrap in 1992.

Structure There are two major components to venous draining: the intrinsic vessels which drain first, and the pial veins which drain second. Within the intrinsic vessels are a group of veins known as central veins. These are organized into individual comb-like repetitive structures that eventually fuse together once in the ventral median spinal fissure. After their fusion the group of central veins drains its combined contents into an anterior spinal vein.Fischer, Georges, and Jacques Brotchi. Intermedullary Spinal Cord Tumors. 2. 1. Paris, France: Masson, 1996. 9. eBook. These veins can infiltrate back into the ventral median spinal fissure previously mentioned by up to a few centimeters. They are also not only smaller in size but more numerous than the equivalent anterior spinal artery which they lie dorsal to. There are three anterior spinal veins in total. These, along with three posterior spinal veins, are allowed to communicate with one another as they run interconnected throughout the entire length of the spinal cord. This is seen through both sets of veins combining to form a network of anastomoses around the conus medullaris. Together, these two sets of veins also collect blood from intramedullary radial veins as well as other veins. They are drained by the anterior and posterior radicular veins, respectably. Radicular veins appear blue to the naked eye. Next, both radicular veins travel to the epidural space by means of joining the internal vertebral venous plexuses. Ultimately, this plexus is able to send and receive information from the veins and sinuses inside the brain. The external vertebral venous plexuses is also available for the internal vertebral venous plexus to communicate with.Lin VW, Cardenas DD, Cutter NC, et al., editors. Spinal Cord Medicine: Principles and Practice. New York: Demos Medical Publishing; 2003. Blood Supply of the Spinal Cord. Available from: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK8851/ Anterior spinal veins fall into the intradural network of the vertebral venous system. The intradural network breaks down into the intramedullary and extramedullary systems which are sets of highly reliable veins. This is because they are vastly redundant in what they do and so only fail under exceedingly unfavorable conditions. Their dependability can be compromised, however, by the bridge that connects them. This fragile link across the dura mater of the spine is known as the radiculomedullary veins. Although these veins connect the trustworthy intramedullary and extramedullary veins, they have no support network to protect them and are seen in much fewer numbers by comparison. This may lead to complications such as thrombosis. For example patients that have spinal dural fistulas can experience venous hypertension caused by thrombosis of these veins.Shapiro, Dr. Maksim. \\"Spinal Venous Anatomy.\\" Neuroangio. WordPress, n.d. Web. 7 Nov 2012. . Function The anterior spinal cord, which makes up 2/3 of the entire spinal cord, gets its blood supply from the anterior spinal artery. This artery in turn receives its blood from the different radiculospinal branches, which are formed from the aorta and vertebral arteries. As the largest of the radiculospinal artery branches, the Artery of Adamkiewicz provides a large amount of blood to the anterior spinal artery, thereby also supplying a good amount to the anterior spinal cord. Research There is a very limited availability to research the spinal venous system as a whole, which in turn leads to an even smaller availability to research the anterior spinal veins. This lack of research is due in great majority to the fact that there is no reliable method of visualizing the system in a noninvasive manner. Although some methods such as an MRI can give off useful information, these stationary glimpses do not show the true actions that take place. The most efficient way to study the spinal venous system along with the anterior spinal veins is to do it postmortem. These types of studies give an effective anatomical demonstration of how the system works. One of the few major studies of the venous anatomy was conducted by Armin Thron, which can be seen in his published ‚ÄúVascular Anatomy of the Spinal Cord‚Äù from 1988.

It lives symbiotically on corals, sea anemones and other marine invertebrates in shallow reef communities. Description Thor amboinensis is a small shrimp growing to a length of about . It is an olive brown colour with symmetrically placed white patches edged with thin blue lines. It characteristically carries its abdomen curved upwards with its tail fan above its head. Distribution Though it is named for Ambon or Amboyna Island, one of the Maluku Islands in Indonesia, Thor amboinensis has a pantropical distribution being found in the Red Sea, the Indian Ocean, the Pacific Ocean, the Caribbean Sea, the Gulf of Mexico, Madeira and the Canary Islands. Ecology Thor amboinensis forms a commensal relationship with another invertebrate, usually a shallow water sea anemone or mushroom coral. The species most often used as host in Bermuda include the carpet anemone (Stichodactyla haddoni), the stinging anemone (Lebrunia danae) and the adhesive anemone (Cryptodendrum adhaesivum). One or several shrimps live among the tentacles of their host, feeding on the tentacle tissue and on the mucus- trapped planktonic particles adhering to it. In the Bahamas, Thor amboinensis forms part of an assemblage of symbiotic invertebrates associated with the anemone Lebrunia danae. Each shrimp, crab and brittle star inhabits its own part of the sea anemone and Thor amboinensis is found hidden deep among the pseudotentacles. Life cycle The female Thor amboinensis carries the fertilised eggs under her abdomen until they are ready to hatch. The zoea larvae pass through several stages and, before undergoing metamorphosis, are attracted by both chemical cues in the water and visual cues which cause them to settle near potential host anemones. Researchers found that the larvae of Thor amboinensis were generalists, being attracted by and accepting several different species of anemone as hosts. In some experiments they had a preference for the species of anemone from which the parent shrimp had been collected. Aquaria Thor amboinensis is a popular species for marine aquaria. Sexy shrimp are often kept in groups of three or more, due to their small size, a quality that also makes them popular nano reef inhabitants. They will readily host in any anemones present in the aquarium and if an anemone is not available, may host in certain types of coral. Sexy shrimp will scavenge for meaty food scraps, like mysis shrimp, clam, and other prepared fish foods. If a host cnidarian is present, they may feed on the host's mucous.

Discussion, argument and analysis are vital parts of scientific temper. Elements of fairness, equality and democracy are built into it. Prime Minister of India Jawaharlal Nehru was the first to use the phrase in 1946 in India. Background The genesis and development of the idea of the scientific temper is connected to ideas expressed earlier by Charles Darwin when he said, \\"[F]reedom of thought is best promoted by the gradual illumination of men's minds, which follows from the advance of science,\\" and by Karl Marx when he said, \\"Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the opium of the people. The abolition of religion as the illusory happiness of the people is the demand for their real happiness. To call on them to give up their illusions about their condition is to call on them to give up a condition that requires illusions.\\" History Jawaharlal Nehru, the first Prime Minister of independent India, was the first to use the phrase in 1946. He later gave a descriptive explanation: Nehru wrote that the scientific temper goes beyond the domains to which science is conventionally understood to be limited to, and deals also with the consideration of ultimate purposes, beauty, goodness and truth. He contended that the scientific temper is the opposite of the method of religion, which relies on emotion and intuition and is (mis)applied \\"to everything in life, even to those things which are capable of intellectual inquiry and observation.\\" While religion tends to close the mind and produce \\"intolerance, credulity and superstition, emotionalism and irrationalism\\", and \\"a temper of a dependent, unfree person\\", a scientific temper \\"is the temper of a free man\\". He also indicated that the scientific temper goes beyond objectivity and fosters creativity and progress. He envisioned that the spread of scientific temper would be accompanied by a shrinking of the domain of religion, and \\"the exciting adventure of fresh and never ceasing discoveries, of new panoramas opening out and new ways of living, adding to [life's] fullness and ever making it richer and more complete.\\" He also stated, \\"It is science alone that can solve the problems of hunger and poverty, of insanitation and illiteracy, of superstition and deadening custom and tradition, of vast resources running to waste, of a rich country inhabited by starving people.\\" Fundamental duty of Indian citizen The Constitution of India encourages the citizens of India to have a sense of scientific temper. According to the Fundamental Duties under Article 51 A(h): > [It shall be the duty of every citizen of India] To develop scientific > temper, humanism and the spirit of inquiry and reform.* Recognition in India The first major programme under the Government of India to popularise scientific temper among the people was the Vigyan Mandir (temple of knowledge/science) experiment in 1953. It was created by S. S. Bhatnagar, at the time Head of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), in Delhi and launched by Nehru on 15 August. Its purpose was to ‚Äúdisseminate scientific information of interest to the rural population‚Äù and the centres were furnished with scientific tools, films, and books. CSIR started publishing a popular science periodical Vigyan Pragati (Progress in Science) in Hindi in 1952. It introduced an English monthly journal Science Reporter in 1964, and then a Urdu quarterly journal Science Ki Dunia. In 1982, the National Council for Science and Technology Communication (NCSTC) was established under the Department of Science and Technology.

It opened in 1850 as the northern terminus of the Buckinghamshire Railway providing connections to Bletchley and Oxford and closing for passengers in 1961 and goods in 1966.  History = Context  Banbury Merton Street was the northern terminus of the Buckinghamshire Railway which consisted of two lines: one from Bletchley to Banbury and another from Verney Junction to Oxford. Construction of the line had begun in July 1847 but was beset by delays and financial problems; priority was given to the construction of the line to Banbury and this was completed on 30 March 1849, with the section from Claydon to Banbury being built to single track rather than double as had been intended. The Oxford branch was opened on 1 October 1850 as far as Islip, reaching a temporary station at Oxford Road on 2 December. The line was to be worked from the outset by the London and North Western Railway (LNWR) which had supported the building of the line and which was represented on the board of the Buckinghamshire Railway by Edward Watkin who, together with the Duke of Buckingham and local landowner Sir Harry Verney MP, was one of the driving forces behind the line.  Opening and early years  The opening of the line on 1 May 1850 took place amid great celebrations in Banbury; the first train departed at 6.30am to a crowd of onlookers but with few paying passengers. More passengers joined the later trains at 9.45am and 1.45pm which were bound for Bletchley where they were met by flags and a brass band. The LNWR provided an initial service of four trains per day, with special excursion trains being laid on for major events such as the 1851 Great Exhibition which attracted 7,072 passengers. Goods traffic was carried as from 15 May and the railway soon became an important factor in the development of the farm machinery industry which continued until right up to the early 1930s. Four months after the opening of Banbury Merton Street, the Great Western Railway (GWR) opened a second station in Banbury on its London to Birmingham line. The station, later to be known as Banbury General, opened on 2 September 1850 and is today Banbury's only remaining station. The walking distance between the two stations was 350, actual distance 20m. The GWR had unsuccessfully opposed the Act of Parliament authorising the construction of the Buckinghamshire Railway, promoting instead the Birmingham & Oxford Junction Railway scheme which included a series of loop lines into Buckinghamshire. The scheme was authorised without the loop lines which became the basis of the Buckinghamshire Railway. Although the Buckinghamshire Railway was moderately prosperous in its early years, it began operating at a loss as a result of a decision to re-route freight through Oxford and Didcot, and the depression that affected railway shares in the late 1850s. It was absorbed by the LNWR on 23 February 1878. By this point it was accepted that Banbury Merton Street was unlikely to develop to anything more than the terminus of a rural branch, the territory to the north and west having been secured by the GWR.  Zenith  A 1911 Railway Clearing House map of railways in the vicinity of Banbury Banbury Merton Street reached its peak of passenger and goods traffic at the outbreak of the First World War. In 1916, the Ministry of Munitions constructed a National Filling Factory on the northern side of the line near Warkworth Crossing approximately from the station platforms. The factory was linked to the line by a standard gauge railway system extending to of track. The factory closed in 1919 and the site was taken over by Messrs Cohen of London who converted it into a factory to break-down thousands of tons of war materials, a process which continued until 1924. In addition to the munitions traffic, Banbury Merton Street also handled troop trains converging from north to south. The 1920s also coincided with a period of growth in Banbury's industries. United Dairies had made Banbury a collecting centre for milk in 1920 and later introduced a system of glass-lined tanks to carry milk in bulk from Banbury General. As a result of its success the company began using Merton Street to transport milk north via the Great Central Railway. In 1921 the Midland Marts Company opened a stockyard alongside the station where cattle could be loaded and unloaded from the railway to be taken on to market. The growth in Merton Street's freight traffic was however matched by a fall in passenger numbers, with Banbury General becoming the town's principal passenger railhead. By 1938, the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (which had taken over the station upon the 1923 railway grouping) attempted to phase out Merton Street by agreeing with the Great Western to rebuild the two stations as a single unit situated on the road bridge to the north of the present Banbury station. Owing to the outbreak of the Second World War, this plan was never put into action and Merton Street was once again busy with troop trains.  Decline and closure  The post- war period saw a further decline in passenger numbers at Merton Street, however freight receipts remained steady as a result of Midland Mart's continued activities. Around 200 cattle vans were handled during per week, the cattle being sorted on arrival and then dispatched for the sheep fair on Tuesday and the T.T. cattle on Wednesday; Thursday brought further cattle traffic as it was market day in Banbury. These activities continued until the early 1960s when British Railways began to phase them out. In August 1956 the Banbury - Buckingham section of the line became the subject of a railcar experiment which saw two new halts open on the line at Radclive and Water Stratford. After three years of service, the railcar had not succeeded in stemming the line's losses and a proposal to withdraw passenger services was published in July 1960, with the last passenger train running on 31 December. Whereas trains had run virtually every half-an-hour, the replacement bus services provided by the Midland Red Bus Company ran only twice a day: at 7.25am and 3.31pm. The line remained open to Buckingham for the purposes of cattle traffic until 1963 with traffic then using the connecting spur to Banbury \\"General\\" station until 1966. Track-lifting commenced the following year. The remaining station, Banbury General, was subsequently renamed as simply \\"Banbury\\".  Station buildings and track layout  From Farthinghoe the track curved round to the west to run nearly parallel with the Great Western's line from Oxford to Banbury before entering Merton Street (21.75 miles from Bletchley). The wooden main station building was frugally built with a timber island platform covered by a glazed roof supported by steel columns. A timber goods shed was initially provided to be later rebuilt in brick. The locomotive shed had capacity for eight engines and up to 1934 acted as a sub-depot for Bletchley with men rostered there. A cattle dock and sidings were provided to handle the substantial agricultural traffic; sidings also led to the nearby gasworks and the Great Western's Banbury yard. The timber boarding on the station roof had by 1956 reached such a condition that it posed a danger to passengers and it was removed leaving the metal supports and piping which were painted white.  Present day  The main station building was swept away soon after closure, leaving the brick goods shed to be used for some time by British Road Services as a storage depot. The station site has been redeveloped for housing.Subterranea Britannica, \\"Banbury Merton Street\\", 16 July 2005.

In terms of international relations (IR) theory, a feminist approach is grouped in the broad category of theoretical approaches known as reflectivism, representing a divergence from approaches adhering to a rationalist outlook based on the premises of rational choice theory; reflectivist approaches, which also include constructivism, post-structuralism, and postcolonialism, regard state identities and interests as continuously in flux, so that norms and identity play as much a role in shaping policy as material interests.Collins, Adam (2016). Contemporary Security Studies. 4th ed. Oxford: Oxford University Press. . pp. 448-449. \\"Glossary\\", entries for \\"rationalism\\" and \\"reflectivism\\". One of the most influential works in feminist IR is Cynthia Enloe's Bananas, Beaches and Bases (Pandora Press 1990). This text sought to chart the many different roles that women play in international politics - as plantation sector workers, diplomatic wives, sex workers on military bases etc. The important point of this work was to emphasize how, when looking at international politics from the perspective of women, one is forced to reconsider his or her personal assumptions regarding what international politics is 'all about'. However, it would be a mistake to think that feminist IR was solely a matter of identifying how many groups of women are positioned in the international political system. From its inception, feminist IR has always shown a strong concern with thinking about men and, in particular, masculinities. Indeed, many IR feminists argue that the discipline is inherently masculine in nature. For example, in her article \\"Sex and Death in the Rational World of Defense Intellectuals\\" Signs (1988), Carol Cohn claimed that a highly masculinised culture within the defense establishment contributed to the divorcing of war from human emotion. Feminist IR theory involves looking at how international politics affects and is affected by both men and women and also at how the core concepts that are employed within the discipline of IR (e.g. war, security, etc.) are themselves gendered. Feminist IR has not only concerned itself with the traditional focus of IR on states, wars, diplomacy and security, but feminist IR scholars have also emphasized the importance of looking at how gender shapes the current global political economy. In this sense, there is no clear cut division between feminists working in IR and those working in the area of International Political Economy (IPE). Feminist IR emerged largely from the late 1980s onwards. The end of the Cold War and the re-evaluation of traditional IR theory during the 1990s opened up a space for gendering International Relations. Because feminist IR is linked broadly to the critical project in IR, by and large most feminist scholarship has sought to problematise the politics of knowledge construction within the discipline - often by adopting methodologies of deconstructivism associated with postmodernism/poststructuralism. However, the growing influence of feminist and women-centric approaches within the international policy communities (for example at the World Bank and the United Nations) is more reflective of the liberal feminist emphasis on equality of opportunity for women. In regards to feminism in International Relations, some of the founding feminist IR scholars refer to using a \\"feminist consciousness\\" when looking at gender issues in politics. In Cynthia Enloe's article ‚ÄúGender is not enough: the need for a feminist consciousness‚Äù, Enloe explains how International Relations needs to include masculinity in the discussion on war, while also giving attention to the issues surrounding women and girls.Enloe, C. (2004), III \\"‚ÄòGender‚Äô is not enough: the need for a feminist consciousness\\". International Affairs, 80: 95‚Äì97. doi: 10.1111/j.1468-2346.2004.00370.x. In order to do so, Enloe urges International Relations scholars to look at issues with a ‚Äòfeminist consciousness‚Äô, which will ultimately include a perspective sensitive to masculinities and femininities. In this way, the feminist consciousness, together with a gendered lens, allows for IR academics to discuss International Politics with a deeper appreciation and understanding of issues pertaining to gender around the world. Enloe argues how the IR discipline continues to lack serious analysis of the experiences, actions and ideas of girls and women in the international arena, and how this ultimately excludes them from the discussion in IR. For instance, Enloe explains Carol Cohn's experience using a feminist consciousness while participating in the drafting of a document that outlines the actions taken in negotiating ceasefires, peace agreements and new constitutions. During this event, those involved came up with the word ‚Äúcombatant‚Äù to describe those in need during these usually high-strung negotiations. The use of ‚Äòcombatant‚Äô in this context is particularly problematic as Carol points out, because it implies one type of militarized people, generally men carrying guns, and excludes the women and girls deployed as porters, cooks and forced ‚Äòwives‚Äô of male combatants. This term effectively renders the needs of these women invisible, and excludes them from the particularly critical IR conversation regarding who needs what in war and peace. This discussion is crucial for the analysis of how various masculinities are at play in International Politics, and how those masculinities affect women and girls during wartime and peace and initially eliminates them from the discussion. Conversely, feminist IR scholar Charlotte Hooper effectively applies a feminist consciousness when considering how ‚ÄúIR disciplines men as much as men shape IR‚Äù.Hooper, C. (1999), \\"Masculinities, IR and the 'Gender Variable': A Cost-Benefit Analysis for (Sympathetic) Gender Skeptics\\". International Studies, 25: 475-491. So, instead of focusing on what and whom IR excludes from the conversation, Hooper focuses on how masculine identities are perpetuated and ultimately are the products of the practice of IR. In this way, it is ineffective to use a gendered lens and feminist consciousness to analyze the exclusion of a discussion in gender in IR. Hooper suggests that a deeper examination of the ontological and epistemological ways in which IR has been inherently a masculine discipline is needed. The innate masculinity of IR is because men compose the vast majority of modern IR scholars, and their masculine identities have been socially constructed over time through various political progressions. For instance, Hooper gives examples of the historical and political developments of masculinities that are still prevalent in IR and society at large; the Greek citizen/warrior model, the Judeo Christian model and the Protestant bourgeois rationalist model. These track the masculine identities throughout history, where manliness is measured in militarism and citizenship, ownership and authority of the fathers, and finally, competitive individualism and reason. These masculinities in turn asks one to not only use the feminist consciousness to analyze the exclusions of femininities from IR, but additionally, Hooper illuminates how one can locate the inherent inclusions of masculinities in the field of IR with a feminist consciousness.  Gender & War  A prominent basis for much of feminist scholarship on war is to emphasize the ways in which men are seen as the sole actors in war. Women, on the other hand, are commonly conceived of as acted upon throughout conflict and conflict resolutions. As asserted by Swati Parashar, they are documented as ‚Äúgrieving widows and mothers, selfless nurses and anti-war activists‚Äù. The reality is that women play various roles in war and for different reasons, depending on the conflict. It is noted that women have actively participated in war since the mid-nineteenth century. This process of eliminating women from war is a tool used to discredit women as agents in the international arena. A focal point for many feminist scholars is mass rape during wartime. These scholars will seek to explain why wartime sexual violence is so prevalent through history and today. Some scholars turn to explanations such as rape as a weapon or as a reward for soldiers during the war. Others see sexual violence as an inevitable consequence when social restraints are removed.  Feminist Anti- Militarism  Feminists within IR often look to how conceptions of masculinity have shaped foreign policy, state identity, and security and armament during and outside of warfare. One tradition that exists within the field for this purpose is that of feminist anti-militarism. This is a stance within Feminist International Relations that opposes weapons of mass destruction, such as nuclear weaponry, and holds gender accountable in part for the propagation of militarism.Cohn, C., & Ruddick, S.

As disarmament could be perceived as emasculatory, states are less likely to disarm; consequently, militarism becomes normalized, downplayed, and more likely to incite warfare.Cohn, C. (1987). Sex and Death in the Rational World of Defense Intellectuals. Signs, 12(4), 687-178. Retrieved from http://genderandsecurity.umb.edu/Carol%20Cohn%20Sex%20and%20Death% These are some of the concepts that Carol Cohn and Sara Ruddick explored in their article ‚ÄúFeminist Ethical Perspective on Weapons of Mass Destruction,‚Äù (2003) which laid out the meaning behind what they referred to as ‚Äúanti-war feminism‚Äù. They explain that it opposes the use of weapons of mass destruction whether for military, political, or deterring purposes, yet that it differs from pacifism in that it does not outright reject all forms of warfare. Such opposition stems partly from the questionability of how effective warfare/militarism is, and whether the costs, (albeit monetary, environmental, and especially human) that are inevitably incurred yet not always accounted, for are worth it. Manifestations of feminist anti-militarism can be identified in various contexts and methods. In line with Cohn and Ruddick's (2003) aforementioned article, part of what feminist anti-militarism critiques is the framework in which weapons of mass destruction are ‚Äúdiscussed‚Äù. Such discourse assumedly would have large influence in the outcome, as investigated by Cohn in one of her earlier articles, ‚ÄúSex and Death in the Rational World of Defense Intellectuals.\\" Her participation in security discussions allowed her to observe the way in which the ‚Äútechnostrategic‚Äù language used by American defense intellectuals was highly gendered, and assigned greater value and strength to that which was assigned masculine or highly sexualized terminology. While Cohn does not explicitly identify the use of a feminist anti-militarist view in this article, the ideas and subjects at hand run parallel. Relatedly, Claire Duncanson and Catherine Eschle do state their use of a feminist anti-militarist perspective in their article ‚ÄúGender and the Nuclear Weapons State: A Feminist Critique of the UK Government‚Äôs White Paper on Trident‚Äù. The authors borrow Cohn's rendition of the relationship between gender and nuclear weapons to examine the way in which discourses are shaped by underlying dichotomous views of masculinity and femininity. This perspective is then applied to the renewal of Trident nuclear weapons, a plan which Duncanson and Eschl argue is enabled by the UK government's use of masculinized language that seems to be constructed into the state's identity. The UK Trident Program was the cause of another expression of feminist anti- militarism, beginning a few decades earlier in the form of the Greenham Common Women's Peace Camp. The 1979 decision by NATO to base ground cruise missiles at Greenham Common initiated a response from women largely associated with various feminist and anti-nuclear groups. Their opposition to such militarism was demonstrated in the persistence of peace camps, demonstrations and other forms of resistance for the following two decades (nat. archive website).The National Archives  Access to Archives. The National Archives. Retrieved September 26, 2013, from http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/a2a/records.aspx?cat=106-5gcw&cid;=-1#-1 Such efforts brought to life the feminist anti-militarist perception of the relationship between gender and militarism as exhibited through nuclear weaponry. Gender theory highlights the limitations of linguistic categories, asserts the significance of intersectionality, values concrete cultural context over universalisms and essentialisms (for example, the notion of universal patriarchy), rigorously problematizes sex and gender binaries, recounts and accounts for the history of sex and gender relations, and deals directly with other theoretical strains such as structuralism, post- structuralism, socialism, and psychoanalysis. For example, in her book Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity, Judith Butler explores the possibility of troubling gender first by examining conventional understandings of gender that support masculine hegemony and heterosexist power, and subsequently wondering about the extent to which one can undermine such constitutive categories (that is, male/female, man/woman) through continually mobilizing, subverting, and proliferating the very foundational illusions of identity which seek to keep gender in its place. Gender theory can inform critical lenses and perspectives such as Cynthia Enloe's ‚Äúfeminist consciousness,‚Äù as well as other feminist perspectives such as liberal feminism, difference feminism, and poststructuralist feminism. In terms of feminist international relations, gender theory engages directly with the notion of mainstreaming gender in both institutional politics and discursive politics. Liberal feminism deals specifically with policy-making, and requires that women as well as perspectives on both women's and men's lived realities are fairly included and represented in that policy-making. With regard to liberal feminism, gender theory contemplates, for example, what is meant by the term ‚Äúwomen,‚Äù whose perspectives on ‚Äúwomen‚Äôs‚Äù and ‚Äúmen‚Äôs‚Äù lived realities are considered valuable in facilitating fair representation in policy-making, and what aspects of life are considered components of ‚Äúlived reality‚Äù. Difference feminism focusses on empowering women in particular through specific designs, implementations, and evaluations of policies that account for the material and cultural differences between men and women and their significance. With regard to difference feminism, gender theory questions, again, what is meant by the term ‚Äúwomen;‚Äù what factors might lead to ‚Äúwomen‚Äù requiring specific designs, implementations, and evaluations of policies; what is considered to constitute ‚Äúdifference‚Äù in the material and cultural experience of ‚Äúmen‚Äù and ‚Äúwomen;‚Äù and what aspects of that ‚Äúdifference‚Äù suppose its especial significance. Poststructuralist feminism prioritizes difference and diversity to the extent that it recognizes all identities as absolutely contingent social constructions. With regard to poststructuralist feminism, gender theory points out that due to this ontological and epistemological discursiveness, poststructuralist feminism can, in some cases, risk understanding the subjects in policy-making as distinct social subjectivities primarily and/or exclusively in terms of gender difference, rather than in terms of the multiplicities of difference that comprise subjectivities in poststructural feminist thought. Discourse starts with the assertion that the public/private divide has meaningfully contributed to women's marginalization. In order to disrupt this marginalization, feminists must challenge the very assumptions that construct our ideas of identity and citizenship. Primarily, poststructuralist feminism seeks to advance Judith Butler's conception of gender as ‚Äòperformative‚Äô, whereby there is no pertinent conception of gender outside of the social construction of masculinity or femininity. Rationalist feminism parallels Neorealist thought by placing the state as the primary actor within international relations. It is also linked to Liberal thought, insofar as it highlights ‚Äòdemocratic peace‚Äô literature, creating an overlap between the paradigms. Relating to gender, rationalist feminism explores not only how war arises, but specifically how gender affects the causes, likelihood and outcome of conflict. Rationalist feminists have, broadly, two strains of research: quantitative foreign policy and comparative case studies. Quantitative foreign policy - may, for example, explore the correlation between gender equality and likelihood of war, or the gender gap on foreign policy opinions. Comparative case studies - may, for example, include looking at sex-selective abortions in different states, the policies that lead to gender disparity and the consequences of such gender disparity. Institutional politics describes the political, material, bureaucratic, and organizational relationships and conventions that govern administrative institutions. Gender theory seeks to examine the ways in which these normalized relationships and conventions shape the policy-making processes of and within these institutions. Discursive politics refers to the ways in which institutionalized norms, policy procedures, organizational identities, and material structures shape the language and meaning of gender equality and/or difference therein. Gender theory, with regard to discursive politics, for instance, would examine the identities, the constitutive categories, created and/or perpetuated by the language and meaning of gender equality and/or difference in such international institutions. Barriers to femininities and female bodies There are different theories that come into play on femininity and female's bodies when speaking about International Relations and the role females have within it. One theory known as a ‚Äòconstructivist‚Äô account of gender, lends itself to arguing that your sex is biological, that is, you are born with it, thus being natural and your gender is something that is social, or learned within the constructs of society. A feminist approach to international relations also provides analyses for not only theoretical understandings of gender relations, but also the consequences that perpetuate the subordination of femininities and female-bodies. ‚ÄòWomen‚Äô (female bodies + performed femininities) endure a higher level of criticism for their actions, personalities, and behaviours within the public and private spheres, particularly while running for political office, whether this at the local or national levels. This is due to a perception of politically ambitious women as either being too feminine or too masculine, to be capable of the job that certain offices demand. This is typically linked to the ideal that women will take care of ‚Äòwomen‚Äôs issues‚Äô, such as education and abortion, while men will take care of ‚Äòmen‚Äôs issues‚Äô such as the military, national security, and the economy. This way of thinking can be attributed to the ‚Äòessentialist‚Äô account of gender and plays into the deeply held belief by many in our society that both men and women inherently hold true to their ‚Äòessence‚Äô of either being feminine or masculine. Women are often viewed as being a caring nurturer in comparison to most men being viewed as aggressive and brash. It is critical that researchers seek to explain further the barriers that women endure in their attempts to attain political office on any level. To begin with, there must be a consideration of women's socioeconomic status, and thus a difficulty in funding a campaign. While women are more educated in the western world than ever before, the average woman's socioeconomic powers still do not match the average man's.Coff√©, Hilde. ‚ÄúWomen Stay Local, Men Go National and Global? Gender Differences in Political Interest.‚Äù Sex Roles 69 (2013) : 323-338. Web. 15 March 2015. This results in a further consequence for women, as employment is positively related to one's ability to attain political information, and to build internal political efficacy. Thus, not only does socioeconomic status lead to a lesser ability to finance a political campaign for women, but it also leads to lower levels of political efficacy, impacting women's participation in politics from the very beginning. Further barriers exist into women's entrance into politics, which include, but are not limited to, attachment to the private sphere and the scrutiny of the media. Media coverage of campaigns can be particularly detrimental to a woman's ability to attain political office. The media focuses far more on physical appearance and lifestyle, rather than the prominent political questions of the campaign, for female candidates. Further, women receive less overall media coverage, the media questions women's abilities and potential for future power, as well as focusing on what are deemed as ‚Äòwomen‚Äôs issues‚Äô. These kinds of coverage discourage voters from voting or contributing to the campaigns of female candidates, and moreover, discourage women from entering into a campaign. Thus, the media has demonstrated its ability to deem candidates either capable or ill-suited for political office, simply through the dialogue in which they use, that perpetuates systems of disqualification for women. These dialogues place men in positions of high politics, and reinforce symbolic understandings of ‚Äòwomen‚Äôs issues‚Äô versus ‚Äòmen‚Äôs issues‚Äô, and who best represents offices of high-politics due to naturalized understandings of individual's bodies and gendered identities. Through a feminist lens of international relations however, we may understand the systemic nature of these perceptions of the relationships between bodies and identities in order to discount popular dialogue, and find places for women within high-politics. The way forward would be for people to create their own ‚Äòfeminist curiosity‚Äô in order to challenge the status quo and push forward on the stage of Feminism in the International Relations Arena. To view gender as ‚Äòperformative‚Äô instead of just something we are born with or into. To pull from Judith Butler's work and view ‚Äúthe sexed body as much a product of discourses about gender as discourse about gender are a product of the sexed body.‚Äù Critique Certain parts of the academic realm of IR theory did not offer the feminist perspective serious attention because of differences with its ways of addressing problems within the discipline.Keohane, R. O. (1998). Beyond dichotomy: Conversations between international relations and feminist theory. International Studies Quarterly, 42(1):193-197 Some circles within social sciences are increasingly employing a hypothetico-deductivist way of looking at social phenomena. In that context, feminist perspective is criticized for providing a more politically engaged way of looking at issues than a problem-solving way. Robert Keohane has suggested that feminists formulate verifiable problems, collect data, and proceed only scientifically when attempting to solve issues. Unsurprisingly, Keohane's suggestion received a cold reaction from feminists; one particular rebuttal was entitled ‚ÄúYou Still Don‚Äôt Understand: Why Troubled Engagements Continue between Feminists and (Critical) IPE.‚ÄùWaylen, Georgina. 2006. ‚ÄúYou Still Don‚Äôt Understand: Why Troubled Engagements Continue between Feminists and (Critical) IPE.‚Äù Review of International Studies 32(1):145‚Äì64. Brown University political scientist Rose McDermott has criticized feminist IR literature as being too exclusively focused on narrative, experiential and qualitative analysis, and for using causal models that are underspecified. In a 2015 article in International Organization, she writes, \\"Feminists often relegate quantitative work to the realm of male influence and experi- ence, even considering it false consciousness in succumbing to male methods of power, thereby surrendering powerful methods and models that could be leveraged to further substantiate the arguments made by feminist analysis regarding inequities in outcome by sex.\\" See also * Feminism in 1950s Britain * International legal theory * Embedded Feminism References Further reading  * Aggestam, Karin, Annika Bergman Rosamond, and Annica Kronsell. \\"Theorising feminist foreign policy.\\" International Relations 33.1 (2019): 23‚Äì39. online * Caprioli, Mary. \\"Gendered conflict.\\" Journal of peace research 37.1 (2000): 51‚Äì68. * Rai, Shirin. \\"Gendering global governance.\\" International Feminist Journal of Politics 6.4 (2004): 579‚Äì601. online * Roberts, Priscilla, ed.

Early life Margo Kane was the only First Nations child adopted into a white working-class home. Her adoptive father had remarried three times. Kane grew up with an abusive and overly strict stepmother, and eventually found herself alienated from her family later on. Kane found an interest in dance at an early age. She was an honours student in school; however, her teenage years led to severe depression. She has described her early life as having a sense of \\"cultural schizophrenia\\". Kane remembers that she knew she was native before her father had even told her. Of her first encounters with the children bussed to her school from the residential school, Kane recalls that \\"we just stared at each other like cows in the field. Just looking wide-eyes, wondering who was going to make the first move.\\".First Nations Drum By the time Kane graduated high school she had, what she describes as an \\"inferiority complex\\". By the age of twenty, Kane had taken up residence on Skid Row, was living off social assistance, and was dependent on drugs and alcohol. Eventually, Kane was able to disentangle herself from her substance abuses, and move away from Skid Row and enroll in Edmonton‚Äôs Grant McEwan College (MacEwan University) for performing arts; it was here that she excelled in dance, acting, and singing. Her performance at McEwan College led to scholarships with Banff School of Fine Arts and Circle in the Square Theatre Company in New York. Acting, teaching, and cultural work Margo received national attention during the late 1970s with the play The Ecstasy of Rita Joe by George Ryga, performed at Citadel Theatre in Edmonton Alberta. During 1982, Kane toured with Prairie Theatre Exchange‚Äôs production of The Ecstasy of Rita Joe. Margo has also involved herself with a national youth caravan which brought theatre to small native communities across Canada. During the 1980s, Kane became involved with the National Native Role Model Program, which highlights the accomplishments of ordinary First Nations, Metis, and Inuit Youth. Through this program, Kane went to Prisons, recovery centres, and group homes. It was around this time that she landed a small part on the CBC's first nations tv series, Spirit Bay, in which she was cast as the school teacher. Margo became the \\"first Native artistic director of Spirit Song Native Theatre School in the 1980s\\". It was here that she realized that she was teaching performance more than performing herself. \\"I realized there weren‚Äôt a whole lot of roles for me out there ‚Äì particularly since I was too old to be an ingenue and too young to be an interesting old lady\\" (Kane). She used her experience as a \\"cultural worker\\" to create roles for herself. Most of her work is autobiographical. She is probably best known for her acclaimed solo-voice drama Moonlodge which has toured for over ten years.Full Circle Her performances blend traditional ritual with storytelling, song, poetry, and dance. A list of her most notable works can be found below. Kane won a Canadian Achievement Award from the National Capital Commission in Ottawa in 1991. Full Circle: First Nations Performance Full Circle: First Nations Performance is Kane‚Äôs own theatre company; it was established in 1992 by Kane, who fulfills the role of managing and artistic director. The mandate for the theatre company is to \\"create opportunities for Aboriginal artists, writers and performers to express the reality of First Nations experiences and to work in harmony with First Nations traditions while engaging modern, interdisciplinary theatrical techniques\\". Collaboration and Networking are integral to Full Circle‚Äôs mandate; much of what is produced is a collaborative effort of the artists involved. Kane in 2016 Full Circle puts on an annual event called Talking Stick Festival, which hopes to \\"establish a unique showcase for talented, emerging and professional artists, to engage Aboriginal cultural communities, and to introduce Vancouver's many audiences to contemporary Aboriginal artistic practices.\\".Full Circle Performance The Theatre Company has also proven itself a leader among other theatre companies through its various workshops, training projects, and performance opportunities. Kane and solo-voice theatre Solo-voice theatre (also known as monodrama, or singular voice theatre) is a style of theatre performance rooted in storytelling and other oral traditions. It is a theatrical piece acted or designed to be acted by a single actor, usually playing a single part; however, not all solo-voice/monodrama pieces have just one character. Moonlodge is an excellent example of solo-voice which requires the transformation from one character to another, often interacting with each other. Kane's use of solo-voice mixes various techniques and styles of theatre including storytelling, ritual, dance, and mime. It is through movement, mimicry, voice changes and intricate use of stage properties that she is able to accomplish these character transformations. Moonlodge Kane has said that she \\"hoped that Moonlodge will be a part of the healing of our people. We have survived tremendous losses with a sense of humour, dignity and honour. We are capable of determining our own future and that of our children.\\".Full Circle: Moonlodge Plot > Agnes is a girl snatched from her home and family by Child Welfare > government services.

Inspiration Kane wrote Moonlodge as a tribute to the women in her life that have encouraged her, and who continue to encourage and guide her. While Moonlodge does not draw directly from Kane's childhood experiences, much of the content can seem biographical. Kane drew on stories and personal experiences of children who were displaced from their homes and families by the Children's Aid Department in the 1950s. Performance history Moonlodge premiered at the Women in View Festival in Vancouver in 1990. Since its premiere, the play has seen performances in Canada, the United States, Europe, and Australia.

Its primary business is the purchasing of defaulted debts from lenders and subsequent collection of those debts through normal debt collection activities. The corporation is headquartered in Warren, Michigan. Asset Acceptance is a trade name used by several companies owned by the parent corporation Asset Acceptance Capital Corporation (AACC). It existed since the formation of the predecessor company in 1962. Asset Acceptance Capital Corporations's main revenue-generating subsidiary is Asset Acceptance, LLC. Asset Acceptance Capital Corporation, a publicly traded company, was one of the largest debt buyers in the United States. The company quadrupled its revenue to $252.7 million from 2001 to 2005. History Asset Acceptance Capital Corp. was a publicly traded company. By 2005 the company's profits rose to $51.3 million. By 2009, Asset Acceptance Capital Corp was one of the \\"four largest publicly traded debt buyers\\" who purchased $19.6 billion in distressed debt along with Encore Capital Group, Asta Funding Inc., and Portfolio Recovery Associates. These four companies were behind the explosion of lawsuits against consumers. According to Association of Credit and Collection Professionals these four debt buyers \\"typically recover three times what they spend buying debt.\\" Asset Acceptance reported net income of $4.2 million in the third quarter of 2010 under the tenure of Rion Needs, President and CEO and Reid Simpson, Senior Vice President and CFO. In March 2013, debt collector Encore Capital Group agreed a deal to buy Asset Acceptance for $200 million. Controversy Time-barred unpaid debt cannot be collected by a debt collector because of the statute of limitations that limits the number of years in which a debt can be collected. After that time limit has passed, unpaid debts are considered \\"time-barred\\" and \\"debt collectors cannot sue you for not paying a debt that's time-barred\\". In spite of the law prohibiting \\"debt buyers\\" from suing or threatening to sue to collect a debt that is older than the applicable statute of limitations, Asset Acceptance and other debt collectors regularly sued consumers on time-barred debt. According to an article by Pulitzer prize-winning journalist, Liz Pulliam Weston in The Wall Street Journal, by 2010, the \\"flood of lawsuits\\" brought by Asset Acceptance, Encore Capital, Asta and Portfolio Recovery against consumers, drowned civil courts. Weston reported that \\"over 90% of all debt buyer lawsuits were \\"won\\" because the defendant did not respond. Per a press release of January 30, 2012, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the United States' consumer protection agency, accepted a settlement against debt buyer Asset Acceptance that included a $2.5 million penalty over several charges including Asset Acceptance's practices regarding time-barred debt.

This is very similar to how ASP and JSP work. * The ~ character in \\":onclick ~(...)\\" indicates that the client should process what is between the parentheses. * The \\"with-hop\\" function in \\"(with-hop (...) (...))\\" is a special function that delegates work to the server and takes two parameters. The first parameter contains the request the client should send to the server asynchronously. The second parameter contains the callback function that the client should invoke when the response arrives from the server. \\"(lambda (h) (alert h))\\" is an anonymous function that takes a single input parameter \\"(h)\\", which contains the server response when the function is called. \\"(alert h)\\" is the function body. Issues Given its recent introduction, Hop currently exhibits a number of weaknesses. * Security is weak. It is an area of active researchYoutube: HOP: A Language for Programming the Web 2.0 starting at 33:50. * Network failures are currently handled through manually coded time-out and exception routines, this approach is labor-intensive and relatively unreliable.

It is a play in one act. She uses symbolism to convey the emptiness of Mrs. Patrick‚Äôs life on the outside. Glaspell uses the imagery of the station and the areas beyond to show that Mrs. Patrick is keeping herself away from the things she once knew. Glaspell‚Äôs use of symbolism aides the characters onstage as well as the audience in realizing the situation the women are facing. The play was first performed by the Provincetown Players at the Playwrights' Theatre, December 28, 1917. It was revived in 1997'Theatre Reviews: The Outside', The Stage 3 April 1997 and 2008 by the Orange Tree Theatre in Richmond, London.  Characters  * Captain, of 'The Bars' Life- Saving Station * Bradford, a Life-Saver * Tony, a Portuguese Life-Saver * Mrs. Patrick, who lives in the abandoned Station * Allie Mayo, who works for her  Plot  The plot centers on two women, Mrs. Patrick and Allie Mayo, who have exiled themselves from the world because of emotional pain caused by their husbands. Allie Mayo has refused to say an ‚Äúunnecessary word‚Äù since the death of her husband. Mrs. Patrick has returned to the place that she and her husband used to visit and had talked of buying to bury the things that hurt her. The main action of the play takes place in an abandoned life-saving station that Mrs. Patrick has recently bought, on the cape, in Provincetown, Massachusetts. Three men, Bradford, Tony, and the Captain, fight to save a man who has drowned at their old station, now the house of Mrs. Patrick. The men have brought the victim to this place because of convenience, since the body was found only forty feet from the house, and out of habit, since they used to work from this location. At the end, it is Allie who tries to save Mrs. Patrick from the life that she wants. References External links  * The Outside at Project Gutenberg  Sources  *Ben-Zvi, Linda.

He drew the ire of Emperor Gaozong by opposing the removal of Emperor Gaozong's first wife Empress Wang and replacement by his favorite concubine, Consort Wu (later known as Wu Zetian) and was exiled. He died in 659, just in advance of a wave of reprisals initiated by the new Empress Wu and her allies that would have included his execution had he not died.  Background  Han Yuan was born in 606, during the reign of Emperor Yang of Sui. His family was from the region of Sui's (and later its successor Tang's) capital Chang'an. His grandfather Han Shao (ÈüìÁ¥π) served as deputy minister of husbandry during Sui Dynasty, and his father Han Zhongliang (Èüì‰ª≤ËâØ) served as deputy minister of justice during the reign of Tang Dynasty's founder Emperor Gaozu. For Han Zhongliang's contributions in revising the laws during Emperor Gaozu's reign, he was later promoted during the reign of Emperor Gaozu's son and successor Emperor Taizong to be minister of justice and was created the Duke of Yingchuan, a title that Han Yuan later inherited. Han Yuan himself was described to be full of integrity and knowledge when he was young, and was said to have skills fit for officials. During Emperor Taizong's reign, he inherited the title of Duke of Yingchuan from Han Zhongliang, and eventually served as deputy minister of defense.  During Emperor Gaozong's reign  In 652, after Emperor Taizong had died in 649 and been succeeded by his son Li Zhi (as Emperor Gaozong). Han Yuan became acting Huangmen Shilang (ÈªÉÈñÄ‰æçÈÉé) -- the deputy head of the examination bureau of government (ÈñÄ‰∏ãÁúÅ, Menxia Sheng). He was also given the designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Sanpin (Âêå‰∏≠Êõ∏ÈñÄ‰∏ã‰∏âÂìÅ), making him a chancellor de facto. In 654, he was given the honorific title Yinqing Guanglu Daifu (ÈäÄÈùíÂÖâÁ•øÂ§ßÂ§´). In 655, he became Shizhong (‰æç‰∏≠) -- the head of the examination bureau and a post considered one for a chancellor, and he was also made a staff member of Emperor Gaozong's son and crown prince Li Zhong. By that point, Emperor Gaozong's favor for his wife Empress Wang had waned, and his favorite concubine was Consort Wu. Early in 655, he wanted to create Consort Wu, who carried the sixth highest rank among imperial consorts, Zhaoyi (Êò≠ÂÑÄ), the unprecedented title of Chenfei (ÂÆ∏Â¶É), and promoting her over all other imperial consorts directly under Empress Wang herself, but Han and fellow chancellor Lai Ji both opposed on the grounds that the title was unprecedented, and so Emperor Gaozong did not carry it out. Later that year, Consort Wu falsely accused Empress Wang and her mother Lady Liu of using witchcraft to try to regain Emperor Gaozong's favor. Emperor Gaozong began discussions with the chancellors on deposing Empress Wang and replacing her with Consort Wu. The chancellors, other than the senior general Li Ji, who refused to render an opinion (but later also stated to Emperor Gaozong that it was his own business and that he needed not ask anyone else) and Emperor Gaozong's powerful uncle Zhangsun Wuji, who showed disapproval by silence, were largely vocal in their opposition, with the strongest opposition from Chu Suiliang. Meanwhile, Han also opposed the move, weeping bitterly during one meeting with Emperor Gaozong, causing Emperor Gaozong to remove him from the palace. He later further submitted a petition, pointing out that Empress Wang was the wife Emperor Taizong selected for Emperor Gaozong and was not known for faults. Emperor Gaozong did not listen and, after demoting Chu to be the commandant at Tan Prefecture (roughly modern Changsha, Hunan), in order to show the other chancellors what he was willing to do, deposed Empress Wang and replaced her with Consort Wu late in 655. (The former Empress Wang and her ally Consort Xiao were later executed cruelly at the instigation of the new Empress Wu.) One of the first things that the new empress did as empress was to submit a petition praising Han and Lai for their faithfulness and requesting that they be rewarded‚Äîa petition that, however, made Han and Lai apprehensive that she was aware of their opposition of her, and Han offered to resign thereafter, an offer that Emperor Gaozong did not accept. In 656, Han nevertheless submitted a petition arguing on Chu's behalf, pointing how faithfully Chu had served both Emperor Gaozong and his father Emperor Taizong. After Han's petition, Emperor Gaozong summoned him and agreed with him that Chu was faithful, but declined to recall Chu on the basis that Chu was disobedient. Han again offered to resign, and Emperor Gaozong again declined. In 657, after Chu had been rotated to be the prefect of Gui Prefecture (Ê°ÇÂ∑û, roughly modern Guilin, Guangxi), Empress Wu's allies Xu Jingzong and Li Yifu accused Han and Lai of conspiring with Chu to rebel‚Äîaccusing them moving to a prefecture of greater military importance than Tan Prefecture. Emperor Gaozong demoted both Han and Lai to be prefects of distance prefectures‚Äîin Han's case, Zhen Prefecture (ÊåØÂ∑û, roughly modern Sanya, Hainan) -- and ordered that they not be allowed to visit the capital. (Chu and Empress Wang's uncle Liu Shi were similarly demoted.) In 659, Empress Wu and her allies furthered the reprisals, this time accusing Zhangsun of plotting treason and accusing Han, Chu, and Liu of being part of the treasonous plot. Zhangsun was deposed and eventually forced to commit suicide. Chu, who had died in 658, was posthumously stripped of all his titles, while orders were sent out, initially for Han and Liu to be stripped of their titles, and then for their execution. Before the executioners could arrive, however, Han had already died. The executioners opened up his casket to make sure that it was his body inside, before returning to Chang'an. His assets were seized, and his family was exiled to the modern Guangdong and Guangxi region. In 705, after Empress Wu (who had, since that point, seized the throne herself with the title of \\"emperor\\" but had been overthrown earlier that year by her son Emperor Zhongzong) died, her will had provisions that restored Han's titles, although whether she wrote those provisions herself was debatable.

Life Otto Ruff was born in Schw√§bisch Hall, W√ºrttemberg. After becoming a pharmacist under the supervision of Carl Magnus von Hell (known from the Hell- Volhard-Zelinsky halogenation) at the University of Stuttgart he joined the group of Hermann Emil Fischer at the University of Berlin. Fischer was noted for his work on carbohydrates (sugars) and so Ruff started his career as an organic chemist. In 1898 he published his work on the transformation of d-Glucose to d-Arabinose, later called the Ruff degradation. Supported by the far-sighted Fischer, who recognized that while organic chemistry was now mature, physical chemistry was growing rapidly, Ruff became head of the new inorganic department in Berlin, working alongside Alfred Stock who was five years his junior. This drastic change in subject benefited Ruff during his work on chlorides sulfur compounds. In 1902 he married Meta Richter, a pharmacist, and from this marriage he had three children. In 1904 he became a professor at the Technical University of Danzig and from 1916 onward he was head of the inorganic chemistry department at the Technical University of Breslau. He died three years after his retirement in 1939. His last years of teaching were made miserable by a privatdozent and assistant, Helmut Hartmann, who had joined the Nazi party and became an \\"insolent politician\\" who made life unbearable for many. Prof. Ruff (r.) with assistant Manfred Giese (l.) between 1932-34 Scientific achievements Otto Ruff published 290 papers and two books. The books were: \\"The Chemistry of Fluorine\\" (published in 1920 by Springer Verlag, Berlin) and \\"Introduction to Chemical Practicum\\" (Leipzig 1926, 2nd edition 1937). His papers can be categorized as follows: chemistry of sugars (17 papers), inorganic chemistry of fluorine (86), high temperature chemistry (44), electrolysis of molten salts (9), plastics (10), carbides (20), explosions in mines (7), other fields of inorganic chemistry (72).

The archaeological site of Altavista, at Chalchihuites, is located 137 miles to the northwest of the city of Zacatecas and 102 miles southeast of the city of Durango. Located to the west of Sombrerete in the northwestern corner of the Zacatecas state, it is believed that the site was a cultural oasis that was occupied more or less continuously from AD 100 to AD 1400. History It was a Teotihuacano ceremonial center lying on the Tropic of Cancer. It has a number of important features, including petroglyphs, a processional walkway and the Hall of Columns. It has some of the best evidence for astronomical alignments at an archaeological site but remains poorly known. The archaeologist Manuel Gamio referred to Chalchihuites as a \\"culture of transition\\" between the Mesoamerican civilizations and the so-called Chichimeca hunter-gatherers who lived in the arid plateau of central Mexico. Chalchihuites and La Quemada were both outposts of Mesoamerican settlement in an ecological and cultural frontier area. However, in this transition zone, climatic changes caused continual shifts in the available resource base, discouraging most attempts at creating permanent settlements. It is also known for a large church that is located in its colonial center. It founded by the Spanish captain Martin Perez in 1556 of a community from Guadalajara, in the first years after the conquest, became known as a mining center since 1591, when a group of Spaniards and Tlaxcalans were to be placed there by order of the viceroy Don Luis de Velasco. It is known that Don Lucas de Montealegre governed that colony as governor. The municipality dates from the same period as that of Sombrerete; From immemorial time it was part of the Mayor's Office of the same name, having constitutional character the year of 1824. Formerly it was called Real of Mines of the Valley of San Pedro de los Chalchihuites, they formed three districts or divisions: Chalchihuites, Tonal√° and Nueva Tlaxcala, But in 1857 this last part, that belonged to Jalisco, was added to the State of Zacatecas by constitutional declaration. Geography The municipality of Chalchihuites is physically located in the Sierra Madre Occidental and Mesa Central. It has a territorial extension of approximately 891 km¬≤, and limits to the north with the municipality of Sombrerete, to the south with the municipality of Jim√©nez of Te√∫l and to the west with the State of Durango. The word Chalchihuites is of Nahuatl origin and means Emerald or precious stone. In the municipality of Chalchihuites five minutes away you will find a very beautiful place better known as Gualterio which has a hot springs spa. Climate The climate is very hot during the summer months and cold in the winter. The site sits lonely in the badlands about four miles east of the town of Chalchihuites. It is also close to the colonial town of Zacatecas, which has a distinctive cathedral.

Sometimes they are combined on freeway off-ramps with \\"Do Not Enter\\" and \\"One Way\\" signs. Fatalities caused by wrong-way driving in the United States, from 1996 to 2000. Wrong-way driving (WWD) is the act of driving a motor vehicle against the direction of traffic. It can occur on either one- or two-way roads, as well as in parking lots and parking garages, and may be due to driver inattention or impairment, or because of insufficient or confusing road markings or signage, or a driver from a right-hand traffic country being unaccustomed to driving in a left-hand traffic country (see Left- and right- hand traffic), and vice versa. People intentionally drive in the wrong direction because they missed an exit, for thrill-seeking, or as a shortcut. On a divided highway, especially freeway, WWD is a serious problem because of the high speeds usually involved, since the result is more likely a head-on collision. In the United States, about 355 people are killed each year in crashes caused by drivers headed in the wrong direction on the highway. Given an average of 265 fatal WWD crashes, 1.34 fatalities per WWD fatal crash can be calculated. The significance of these kind of crashes is corroborated when this number is compared to the fatalities per fatal crash rate of 1.10 for all other crash types, which translates to 24 more fatalities per 100 fatal crashes for WWD crashes than for fatal crashes in general. Most drivers who enter a divided highway or ramp in the wrong direction correct themselves by turning around. Depending on the jurisdiction, WWD is a punishable offense. In New Zealand, WWD is counted as careless driving and can result in up to 5 years imprisonment and/or a fine up to NZ$10,000. Efforts to reduce wrong- way driving One of the aims of highway engineering is to reduce wrong-way driving. Therefore, many nations, including the U.S., Japan, and Canada, have made great efforts to combat this issue, especially in the recent years.  United States  National Transportation Safety Board's Highway Special Investigation Report = This topic of safety has gained renewed attention in the recent years in the United States. In doing so, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) published a special investigation report about wrong-way driving in which relevant safety countermeasures to prevent wrong-way collisions on high-speed, divided highways are identified. One important part of this report is Section 4 which provides recommendations for different agencies, including Federal Highway Administration and NHTSA, to address wrong-way collisions. =2013 National Wrong-Way Driving Summit= The first National Wrong-Way Driving Summit was held July 18 and 19, 2013, at the Morris University Center (MUC) of Southern Illinois University Edwardsville (SIUE). The purpose of this summit, sponsored by the Illinois Center for Transportation (ICT) and Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT), was to provide a platform for practitioners and researchers to exchange ideas, evaluate current countermeasures, and develop best practices to reduce wrong-way crashes and incidents through a 4E‚Äôs approach (Engineering, Education, Enforcement, and Emergency Response). To enhance the quality of this summit, a significant number of attendees were brought together to discuss various topics during individual presentations, as well as to take part in broader topical group discussions. Overall, approximately 130 attendees from 23 states participated in this summit, including from states that have already implemented and tested various countermeasures and those in which wrong-way driving has been found to be a major of concern. Summit organizers also published the proceeding of the summit in May 2014 that contains all the presentations as well as the results of a survey questionnaire distributed to all the attendees to gather the latest information about the current practices for mitigating wrong-way driving issues. The proceedings of the Summit, along with additional research and investigation effort, resulted in the preparation and publication of the Guidelines for Reducing Wrong-Way Crashes on Freeways, a cooperative effort of IDOT, ICT, and FHWA. = Wrong-Way Driving Guidebook = In May 2014, ICT and IDOT published Guidelines for Reducing Wrong-Way Crashes on Freeways. The researchers compiled the guidebook by reviewing previous studies, assessing current practices, and examining national and state design standards and manuals that pertain to WWD. The research team also obtained significant information from the National Wrong-Way Driving Summit hosted by IDOT and SUIE as part of this project in July 2013. =Overview of Wrong-Way Driving Fatal Crashes in the United States= In August 2014, Institute of Transportation Engineers published a paper to provide an overview of the general trend of WWD fatal crashes in the United States; discuss general characteristics of WWD fatal crashes; and delineate significant contributing factors. The researchers found an average of 269 fatal crashes resulting in 359 deaths occurred annually in the United States during an 8-year period covering the years 2004 through 2011. It was found that Texas, California, and Florida account for the highest number of WWD fatal crashes and fatalities and represent almost one- third of the national totals. =ATSSA's wrong-way driving executive summary= The American Traffic Safety Services Association (ATSSA), in February 2014, published a document titled \\"Emerging Safety Countermeasures for Wrong-way Driving\\" that was developed in the framework of an executive summary of various case studies that aim at providing transportation practitioners with a good understanding of WWD incidents and emerging safety countermeasures. In addition to bringing available information together in one document, contacts were suggested for each case study to help readers get at least additional the complementary information about each countermeasure they are considering.

Avalanche control or avalanche defense activities reduce the hazard avalanches pose to human life, activity, and property.\\"Mitigation and Land Use - Avalanches\\" , Colorado Geological Survey Avalanche control begins with a risk assessment conducted by surveying for potential avalanche terrain by identifying geographic features such as vegetation patterns, drainages, and seasonal snow distribution that are indicative of avalanches. From the identified avalanche risks, the hazard is assessed by identifying threatened human geographic features such as roads, ski-hills, and buildings. Avalanche control programs address the avalanche hazard by formulating prevention and mitigation plans, which are then executed during the winter season. The prevention and mitigation plans combine extensive snow pack observation with three major groups of interventions: active, passive and social - sometimes more narrowly defined as \\"explosive\\", \\"structural\\", and \\"awareness\\" according to the most prevalent technique used in each. Avalanche control techniques either directly intervene in the evolution of the snow pack, or lessen the effect of an avalanche once it has occurred. For the event of human involvement, avalanche control organizations develop and train exhaustive response and recovery plans. Risk and hazard assessmentPrevention and mitigation Prevention and mitigation begins with observing the snow pack to forecast the risk of avalanche occurrence. The forecast risk then determines the necessary interventions to reduce the hazard posed by an avalanche. Observation and forecasting Snow pack observation studies the layering and distribution of the snow to estimate the instabilities of the snow pack and thus the risk of an avalanche occurring in a particular terrain feature. In areas of heavy human use the snow pack is monitored throughout the winter season to assess its evolution under the prevailing meteorological conditions. In contrast to heavily used avalanche terrain where forecasting is the goal of snow observation, in remote terrain, or terrain that is infrequently visited, snow pack observation elucidates the immediate instabilities of the snow pack. Active interventions French ski resort of Tignes (3,600 m) Gazex installation Active techniques reduce the risk of an avalanche occurring by promoting the stabilization and settlement of the snow pack through three forms of intervention: disrupting weak layers in the snow pack, increasing the uniformity of the snow pack, and lessening the amount of snow available in snow pack for entrainment in an avalanche; this can be accomplished either by triggering smaller less hazardous avalanches, or by directly influencing the structure of the layering of the snow pack. Active avalanche control can be broadly classified into either mechanical or explosive methods. Mechanical methods are typically used in either remote terrain, smaller terrain, or less hazardous terrain; while explosive methods are used in accessible large high hazard terrain, or terrain with industrial, commercial recreational, urbanized, and transportation usage. In the smallest terrain features the simplest method of avalanche control that disrupts weak snow layers by directly walking through them, a technique referred to as boot packing. For larger features this method can extended by mechanized redistribution of snow using large tracked vehicles called snow groomers. These two mechanical interventions can only be safely done as the snow is deposited and before it develops any instabilities. In terrain that can only be sporadically accessed, or in a highly developed snow pack that is too deep for boot packing, ski stabilization techniques are used. The first technique of ski stabilizing is a method of entering a slope called ski cutting. In this method a skier attempts to trigger a small avalanche by breaking the tensile support of the upper snow pack through a quick traverse along the top of the slope, the skier can be belayed on a rope to further protect them from being caught in an avalanche. A snow pack can then be further settled out, or stabilized, by further down slope ski traffic through it. Finally knotted cord can be used to saw through the roots of cornices, causing the cornice to drop onto the snow pack of the slope below. This has the combined effect of reducing the objective hazard posed by the cornice, and providing a large impact force on the snow pack. Forest Service team using a 105mm recoilless rifle for avalanche control at Mammoth Mountain in the Inyo National Forest. Explosive techniques involve the artificial triggering of smaller less destructive avalanches, by detonating charges either above or on the snow surface. The explosives may be deployed by manually hand tossing and lowering, by bombing from a helicopter, or by shelling with a small howitzer, recoilless rifle, or air gun. In balancing the hazard to personnel with the effectiveness of the deployment method at accessing and triggering avalanche terrain, each method has its drawbacks and advantages. Among the newest methods, strategically placed remote controlled installations that generate an air blast by detonating a fuel-air explosive above the snow pack in an avalanche starting zone, offer fast and effective response to avalanche control decisions while minimizing the risk to avalanche control personnel; a feature especially important for avalanche control in transportation corridors. For example, the Avalanche Towers (Sprengmast) Austria, and Norway use solar powered launchers to deploy charges from a magazine containing 12 radio controlled charges. The magazines can be transported, loaded, and removed from the towers by helicopter, without the need for a flight assistant, or on site personnel. Explosive control has proved to be effective in areas with easy access to avalanche starting areas and where minor avalanches can be tolerated. It is mostly unacceptable, however, in areas with human residence and where there is even a small probability of a larger avalanche. Permanent interventions Forest and structures to protect against avalanches. Permanent techniques slow, stop, divert, or prevent snow from moving; either completely or to enough of an extent that the destructive forces are significantly lessened. Permanent techniques involve constructing structures and modifying terrain for purposes classified as: *Snow retention structures (snow racks, avalanche snow bridges, snow nets), used in the upper path of probable avalanche paths *Avalanche barriers: The main part of the avalanche barriers is based on a high tensile strength steel wire mesh, extending across the slope and reaching to the surface of the snow. The supporting effect created by the retaining surface prevents possible creeping within the snow cover and sliding of the snow cover on the terrain surface. Breaking-away of avalanches is thus prevented at the starting zone, while occurring snow movements are restricted to the extent that they remain harmless. The forces resulting from the snow pressure are absorbed by the snow nets and carried off over the swivel posts and anchor ropes into the anchor points. *Snow guard devices (used to increase snow retention on roofs). *Snow redistribution structures (wind baffles, snow fences) *Snow deflection structures used to deflect and confine the moving snow within the avalanche track.. They should not deflect the avalanche sharply, because in the latter case they may be easily overrun by snow. *Snow retardation structures (e.g. snow breakers), mostly used in small-slope parts of the avalanche track, to enhance the natural retardation *Snow catchment structures *Direct protection of important objects and structures, e.g., by snow sheds (avalanche sheds) or schneekragens (in mining areas). A single intervention may fulfill the needs of multiple classes of purpose, for example, avalanche dams, ditches, earth mounds, and terraces are used for deflection, retardation, and catchment. Other passive methods include: *reforestation, up the natural tree line -- forests serve all the functions of artificial avalanche defenses: retention, redistribution, retardation and catchment *snow caves, as well as recessed, dug out, and snow walled quinzhees and bivouac shelters are used to temporarily protect bivouacking climbers and skiers by providing them with breathing space in the event of burial by avalanches. *Architectural streamlining and wedge shaping buildings, such as those found in the historic high mountain villages of the Alps.. =Snow shed= Trains passing in an avalanche gallery on the Wengernalpbahn in Switzerland. A snow shed or avalanche gallery is a type of rigid snow-supporting structure for avalanche control or to maintain passage in areas where snow removal becomes almost impossible. They can be made of steel, prestressed concrete frames, or timber.Photographs of avalanche defences, FAO corporate document repository These structures can be fully enclosed, like an artificial tunnel, or consist of lattice-like elements. They are typically of robust construction considering the environments they must survive in. Snow protection is particularly important when routes cross avalanche \\"chutes\\", which are natural ravines or other formations that direct or concentrate avalanches. Snow sheds or avalanche galleries are a common sight on railroads in mountain areas, such as the Donner Pass in the United States or many of the Swiss mountain railways, where tracks are covered with miles of shedding. Although unused today, the Central Pacific Railroad had a complete rail yard under roof in the pass. They are also found on especially hazardous stretches of roadway as well. The Trans-Canada Highway between Revelstoke and Golden in British Columbia has several snow sheds covering both carriageways to cope with the heavy snow. East of Snoqualmie Pass in Washington in the northwest U.S., westbound Interstate 90 had a snow shed midway along the east shore of Keechelus Lake (, milepost 57.7); it was removed in 2014 in preparation for the construction of bridges to replace it. (dead link 8 March 2019) The concrete structure covered two lanes on a curve and was constructed in 1950 for U.S. Route 10, then one lane in each direction; it marked the first time precast construction was used for a highway structure in a mountainous area and was the last remaining snow shed on an Interstate highway. (dead link 8 March 2019) =Snow bridge= Snow bridges in Switzerland. A snow bridge, avalanche barrier, or avalanche fence, looks superficially similar to snow fences, but they act differently. Snow fences are built vertically and accumulate snow on their downwind side, while snow bridges are slanted or horizontal and hold snow on their top side. Snow bridges are fastened to the slope on the upslope side by tension anchors and on the downslope by compression anchors.\\"Steel snow bridges\\" =Avalanche dam= Avalanche dams (anti-avalanche dams, avalanche protection dams) are a type of avalanche control structure used for protection of inhabited areas, roads, power lines, etc., from avalanches. The two major types are deflection and catchment dams. The design of avalanche protection dams. Recent practical and theoretical developments Both types of avalanche dams are usually placed in the run-out zone of the avalanche and in the flatter parts of the avalanche path. In other parts of the avalanche they are ineffective because they may be easily overrun or overfilled. =Avalanche net= Avalanche nets (snow avalanche protection nets, snow nets) are flexible snow supporting structures for avalanche control, constructed of steel or nylon cables or straps held by steel poles, optionally supplied with compression anchors downhill. They are installed in the upper parts of potential avalanche paths to prevent snow from starting to slide into an avalanche, or to retard the slide.\\"Mitigation and Land Use - Avalanches\\" , Colorado Geological Survey Snow avalanche nets have the following advantages compared to rigid supporting structures (snow fences, snow racks, snow sheds): *considerably lower costs *better blending into the environment *easier installation *rigid structures are more prone to damage in unstable terrains (with earthquakes, landslides, rockfall,Nets are less damaged by rocks because their flexible structure dissipates the kinetic energy of falling rocks, see \\"Protective barrier, in particular for mountainous places\\", patent description permafrost-mediated soil creep\\"Snow- supporting structures in permafrost\\") and in conditions of heavy rainfall and mudflows. Avalanche nets have some drawbacks, as they are more difficult to anchor in loose ground. Social interventions To mitigate the hazard of avalanches, social interventions reduce the incidence and prevalence of human avalanche involvement by modifying the behavior of people, so that their use of avalanche terrain is adapted to prevent their involvement in avalanches. Avalanche control organizations accomplish this by targeting awareness and education programs at communities that frequent avalanche terrain. Surveys of avalanche accidents have observed that most avalanches that involve people are caused by people, and of those victims many were unaware of the risk of avalanche occurrence. To address this observation, introductory awareness and education programs provide instruction in the avoidance of hazardous avalanche involvement through the recognition of avalanche terrain, the observation of snow pack instabilities, and the identification of human activities that cause avalanches. Avalanche control organizations also publicly disseminate forecasts, bulletins, warnings, and reports of avalanche activity to assist communities of avalanche terrain users. Response and recovery Avalanche control organizations plan for, and respond, to avalanches. Typical responses span from clearing transportation corridors of avalanche debris, to repairing industrial and recreational facilities, to search, rescue, and recovery. To improve the outcome of human avalanche involvement avalanche control organizations offer training and education to both professionals and recreational amateurs in avalanche preparedness. Professional preparedness Professional responses to avalanches are targeted at avalanches involving the general unprepared public. When avalanches are forecast to occur, avalanche terrain to which the general unprepared public is exposed will be closed, and after the avalanches have occurred the area is cleared of debris, and repaired. When unexpected avalanches occur that involve the general unprepared public, avalanche control organizations respond with large professionally organized search teams involving probe lines, and trained search and rescue dogs. Amateur preparedness Recreational response to avalanches involves the rapid formation of an ad hoc search and rescue team. The ad hoc search and rescue teams rely on all the participants having prepared for a potential avalanche by carrying the correct search and rescue equipment, and undergoing the appropriate training.

Born in Oylegate, County Wexford, Nolan first played competitive hurling in his youth. He quickly came to prominence at underage levels with the Oylegate-Glenbrien club, before later winning championship medals in the junior and intermediate grades. Nolan is a one-time championship medal winner at senior level.  Biography  Nolan arrived on the inter-county scene at the age of seventeen when he first linked up with the Wexford minor team. He joined the senior team as sub-goalkeeper for the 1956 championship. Nolan went on to play a key part for Wexford during a hugely successful era for the county, and won three All-Ireland medals, six Leinster medals and three National Hurling League medals. He was an All- Ireland runner-up on three occasions. As a member of the Leinster inter- provincial team on a number of occasions, Nolan won four Railway Cup medals. Throughout his career he made 36 championship appearances. Nolan's retirement came following Wexford's defeat by Kilkenny in the 1974 championship. Nolan is widely regarded as Wexford's greatest-ever goalkeeper. Playing career=Inter-county Nolan first played for Wexford as a member of the minor hurling team in 1955. The following year he had impressed the selectors so much that he was in a position to challenge Art Foley for the goalkeeping position on the senior team. In the end, Nolan remained in the reserves that year as Wexford claimed the Leinster and All-Ireland titles following respective victories over Kilkenny and Cork. Two year later in 1958 Nolan won a National Hurling League medal following a 5‚Äì7 to 4‚Äì8 defeat of Limerick. Nolan won his first Leinster medal on the field of play in 1960 following a 3-10 to 2-11 defeat of reigning champions Kilkenny. This victory allowed Wexford to advance directly to an All-Ireland final meeting with Tipperary on 4 September 1960. A certain amount of over-confidence was obvious in the Tipperary camp, particularly in trainer Phil Purcell's comment that no player was capable of marking Jimmy Doyle. The game ended in remarkable circumstances as the crowd invaded the pitch with a minute to go, mistaking the referee's whistle for the end of the game. When the crowd were finally moved off the pitch Tipperary continued playing with only twelve men, but Wexford won on a score line of 2‚Äì15 to 0‚Äì11. It was Nolan's first All-Ireland victory on the field of play and his second winners' medal overall. After surrendering their provincial and All-Ireland titles in 1961, Wexford bounced back the following year. A 3-9 to 2-10 defeat of Kilkenny gave Nolan his third Leinster medal. Tipperary were waiting in Croke Park to test Wexford once again in the subsequent All-Ireland final on 2 September 1962. Wexford, however, were not the force of old and the side got off to possibly the worst start ever by a team in a championship decider. After just ninety seconds the Leinster champions were down by two goals, however, the game turned out to be much closer than people expected. Tipperary eventually secured the win on a score line of 3‚Äì10 to 2‚Äì11. In 1965 Nolan won his fourth Leinster medal as Kilkenny were narrowly defeated by 2-11 to 3-7. Tipperary were Wexford's opponents in the subsequent All-Ireland final on 5 September 1965, however, the game failed to live up to the two classic games between the two sides in 1960 and 1962. Victory went to Tipperary on that occasion by 2‚Äì16 to 0‚Äì10, courtesy of a brace of goals by Se√°n McLoughlin. Nolan claimed his second National Hurling League medal in 1967 when a 3‚Äì10 to 1‚Äì9 defeat of Kilkenny gave him a second winners' medal. Nolan won a fifth Leinster medal in 1968 following a 3-13 to 4-9 defeat of reigning provincial and All-Ireland champions Kilkenny. This victory allowed Wexford to advance to an All-Ireland final against Tipperary, the outstanding team of the decade, on 1 September 1968. All was going to plan for Tipperary as they took a 1‚Äì11 to 1‚Äì3 lead at half-time. In one of the great All-Ireland comebacks, Tony Doran got Wexford back on track with a goal six minutes after the interval. Three more goals followed from Paul Lynch, Jack Berry and Doran again. Late goals from Michael \\"Babs\\" Keating and Se√°n McLoughlin for Tipperary failed to stem the tide as Wexford secured a remarkable 5‚Äì8 to 3‚Äì12 victory. The victory gave Nolan his third All-Ireland medal. After surrendering their championship titles in 1969, Wexford regrouped the following year. A 4‚Äì16 to 3‚Äì14 defeat of old rivals Kilkenny in the very first 80-minute championship game gave Nolan a sixth Leinster medal. Wexford subsequently faced Cork in the All-Ireland decider on 6 September 1970. A record 64-point scoreline and eleven goals were produced in a sometimes ill- tempered and disappointing contest. Tony Doran top scored for Wexford with two goals, however, the day belonged to Eddie O'Brien who scored a hat-trick of goals for Cork from his hand. A remarkable 6‚Äì21 to 5‚Äì10 score line gave Cork the victory. Nolan won a third National Hurling League medal in 1973 following a 4‚Äì13 to 3‚Äì7 defeat of Limerick. Inter-provincial Nolan was first picked on the Leinster inter-provincial in 1964 as reserved goalkeeper to Ollie Walsh. He won hist first Railway Cup medal as a non-playing substitute following a 3-7 to 2-9 defeat of Munster. In 1965 Nolan was unable to oust Walsh as first-choice goalkeeper once again. Nevertheless, he won a second Railway Cup medal as a substitute following a 3-11 to 0-9 defeat of Munster once again. Nolan remained off the team for a number of years before returning as the first-choice goalkeeper in 1971. Munster provided the opposition once again, however, a 2-17 t 2-12 victory gave Nolan his third Railway Cup medal. In 1974 Nolan won his fourth Railway Cup medal, his third as a substitute, as Leinster defeated Munster by 2-15 to 1-13.

The Great Tea Race of 1866 was keenly followed in the press, with an extremely close finish. Taeping docked 28 minutes before Ariel - after a passage of more than 14,000 miles. Ariel had been ahead when the ships were taken in tow by steam tugs off Deal, but after waiting for the tide at Gravesend the deciding factor was the height of tide at which one could enter the different docks used by each ship. The third finisher, Serica, docked an hour and 15 minutes after Ariel. These three ships had left China on the same tide and arrived at London 99 days later to dock on the same tide. The next to arrive, 28 hours later, was Fiery Cross, followed, the next day, by Taitsing. Given the close finish, and fearing that the consignees might find reason to avoid payment, the prize, or \\"premium\\", was claimed by Taeping but shared between them and Ariel, by agreement of their agents and owners. 1866 was the last time that a premium was written into the bill of lading of a tea clipper for docking in London with the first of the new crop. Though clippers raced with cargoes of tea for a few more years, the only commercial advantage was in the reputation as a fast ship, thereby securing a better rate of freight in the future. Whilst the outcome thrilled its followers, it was clear to some that the days of the tea clipper were numbered. The auxiliary steamer Erl King had sailed from Foochow 8 days after Ariel, carrying both passengers and a cargo of tea. She arrived in London 15 days before the sailing ships.Paisley Herald and Renfrewshire Advertiser - Saturday 25 August 1866, page 4, column 3 The SS Agamemnon, a much more fuel efficient ship than her contemporaries, had just made the fastest ever outward passage to China of 65 days and was on her way to London with a cargo of tea that was two or three times larger than a clipper could carry. The Suez Canal was under construction (and opened in 1869). This would give a much shorter route (a reduction of about 3,300 NM or nearly a quarter less distancehttp://www.suezcanal.gov.eg/), so favouring the steamships, as the Canal was not a practical option for sailing vessels. Background Tea was introduced from China to Europe in the 17th century, but, as a luxury item, was not transported in significant quantities until the 19th century. China was the main centre of production until late in the 19th century. The British East India Company's monopoly of the tea trade from China to Britain ceased in 1834. This opening to competition meant that faster ships were needed, as merchants vied to be first in the market with each new crop of tea. Unlike the slower East Indiamen that had carried tea during that company's monopoly, the tea clippers were designed for speed. Those that had achieved particularly fast passages could usually command a higher freight (the price paid to transport the cargo) than others. Tea wholesalers would mention in advertisements which ship had carried the different batches being sold.for example: Adverts, 2 June 1865, Leicester Journal pg 5, column 4 It was often the case that tea that was loaded early in China was of somewhat poorer quality than that which became available a few weeks later in the season. Yet this was what was carried by the first ships home and sold to the public with the cachet of a fast passage. The first cargo of tea landed could be very profitable for tea merchants, so they introduced incentives. In 1854, Vision had a premium of an extra ¬£1 per ton included in her bill of lading, payable if she was the first to dock. In 1855 Maury and Lord of the Isles raced for a premium of ¬£1 per ton, with the latter the winner through getting a better tug to get up-river. Note that the premium did not simply reward the fastest passage, since rapid loading of a cargo and a prompt departure were important factors. In 1861, the consignees offered a premium of 10s per ton to the first ship to dock in London. This was won by the Fiery Cross, who also went on to win in 1862, 1863 and 1865. At this time, anyone with a particular interest in shipping or business could easily follow the performance of tea clippers through the \\"Shipping Intelligence\\" column of their newspaper ‚Äî and trade in tea was discussed in the commodities section of the business column.for example: \\"Shipping Intelligence\\", 11 Sep 1865, Liverpool Daily Post, pg 11 (third edition), column 2 The \\"news\\" sections of newspapers started to comment on the first ship to dock from 1857.\\"Condensed News\\", 7 October 1857, Dumfries and Galloway Standard, page 3, column 7 By 1866, newspaper interest was at its height, with speculation, updates and detailed reports.for example: \\"The Great Ocean Race from China\\", 11 August 1866, Western Daily Press pg 2, column 2\\"The Great Ocean Race from China\\", 1 Aug 1866, Glasgow Herald, pg 4, column 4 Many bets were placed on the outcome of the race, in London, Hong Kong, and the ports of Britain, and by the captains and crews of the vessels involved. Contenders  Taeping The tea trade from China was a large undertaking. MacGregor lists 57 ships sailing in the 1866-67 tea season, with a clear caveat that not every ship is listed - only the ones that he had researched. Over the season, these sailed from several ports: Foochow, Hankow, Shanghai, Woosung, Canton and Hong Kong. Most departure dates stretch from the end of May 1866 through to February 1867. In May 1866, 16 of the best clippers had assembled at the Pagoda Anchorage on the Min River, downriver from Foochow (Fuzhou). The quickest ships, as judged by the agents based in China, would be loaded first. However, it was not always the fastest that sailed first - much depended on the tonnage of the vessel and the standing and influence of the local agent. The front runners of the 1866 Tea Race were: *Ariel, launched in 1865. She was thought to be the fastest of her day, being designed for excellent performance in light winds. The downside to this was that in a strong gale, sail had to be reduced rapidly or the ship even hove to, as her extreme lines left her susceptible to being pooped or, if going to windward, damage would be caused by waves sweeping the deck. She was of composite construction (wooden planking on an iron framework), built at the yard of Robert Steele & Company in Greenock on the Clyde. She carried 100 tons of fixed iron ballast, moulded to fit low in the hull and a further 20 tons of moveable iron ballast. This gives an indication of the \\"yacht like\\" nature of her design. *Fiery Cross had been the first tea clipper home in 1861, 1862, 1863 and 1865. As a slightly older ship, built in 1860, she predated the widespread acceptance of composite construction, so was built of wood. Nevertheless, she was full of the latest technology; for example steel masts and Cunningham's patent roller reefing topsails and t'gallants. *Serica, launched in 1863, was another ship built by Robert Steele & Company, and the penultimate wooden clipper from that yard before they moved to composite construction. She was the first ship home from China in 1864, and was closely beaten (through lack of a tug) by Fiery Cross in 1865. * Taitsing was another Clyde-built ship, of composite construction. She was launched from the yard of Charles Connell & Co. of Glasgow in 1865, so was on her first trip to China. * Taeping was the first composite ship built by Robert Steele & Co (the third from this yard out of the five ships listed here), being launched in 1863. On her maiden voyage she was dismasted in a typhoon off Formosa (Taiwan), losing her foremast and main and mizzen topmasts. After repairs in Amoy (Xiamen), she then made a remarkably fast passage of 89 days to London. Loading The Pagoda Anchorage, Foochow, in 1866. The Tea Clippers lined up awaiting their cargo. Pictured from Left to Right - The 'Black Prince', 'Fiery Cross', 'Taitsing', 'Taeping', and 'Flying Spur' The race was not only a test of sailing, but also of efficient management at the port of departure. Each ship needed to be ready to receive her cargo. The hold was prepared by spreading a layer of clean shingle across the bottom to act as ballast. This was additional to the iron ballast carried by these extreme clippers. Between 150 and 200 tons of shingle was needed, and it was levelled to follow the curve of the deck above, at a distance precisely measured to be an exact number of tea chests. The tea arrived in lighters called \\"chop boats\\" (taking their name from the identifying marks on each batch of tea they carried). Lower value chests were loaded first as a layer across the ballast, with some shingle being packed between the chests and side of the hold. Then the main cargo was loaded in further layers, being carefully packed in with dunnage by the excellent Chinese stevedores. Despite the care taken, loading could be done quickly. In the 1850s, a ship loaded 8,000 chests of tea and 1,141 bales of silk in 17 hours work spread over two days. On 24 May, the first lighters arrived with tea, packed in chests, ready for loading. On Ariel, the first layer of 391 chests and 200 half-chests were loaded. By 27 May, she had 16 lighters alongside, with the Chinese stevedores working round the clock to stow the main part of the cargo. At 2 pm on the 28th, the job was done, giving a total of 1,230,900 lbs of tea. Ariel was first to complete loading. At 5 pm, she unmoored and moved down-river to anchor for the night, ready for an early start. The same task was underway on other ships in the anchorage. Fiery Cross was next to finish, some 12 hours later, loading 854,236 lbs. Her master, Captain Robinson, in his haste to sail, neglected to complete his paperwork or sign his bills of lading - to the fury of Captain Innes of Serica. Taeping and Serica were able to get away together, having loaded 1,108,700 lbs and 954,236 lbs respectively. Taitsing, with 1,093,130 lbs, was a day behind. To sea Ariel started to raise her anchor at 5 am on the 29th and with the paddle steamer Island Queen towing alongside, headed down-river for the sea. The river pilot left and the tug was sent ahead to tow. The fast flowing River Min then presented problems for the under-powered tug as they met eddies and Ariel had to anchor to regain control of the situation. By this time it was low tide. With a mean draft of 18 ft 5.5 ins., there was not enough water for her to get over the bar. Captain Keay's frustration was increased by Fiery Cross, with a more powerful tug and drawing significantly less, towing past her and getting out to sea. Then the weather closed in: poor visibility preventing safe departure on the next tide. On the morning of the 30th, Ariel finally got to sea, but with Taeping and Serica only a few minutes behind and Fiery Cross 14 hours ahead. In a final delay, Ariel could not leave her pilot on Island Queen, as the tug's boat capsized on launching (the boat crew eventually being rescued) - so a pilot boat had to be summoned. Three of the front runners now had as level a start in the race as a spectator could hope for. There was a moderate northeast wind and the course set was \\"South by East a half East\\" (163 degrees on a modern compass). All three had set their main skysails and fore topmast and lower stunsails. Ariel was slowly over-hauling the other two ships, but then the weather closed in and they lost sight of each other, racing on unseen in the rain. Newspaper reports News reports of the start appeared in British newspapers from 11 June, when The Pall Mall Gazette carried a list of the first four starters, and names of the rest of the ships waiting to sail. The only additional information was that \\"the betting at Hong Kong runs very high\\".\\"Occasional Notes\\", 11 June 1866, The Pall Mall Gazette, page 9, column 1 This was copied widely in other newspapers.for example: \\"Ocean Race\\", 13 June 1866, Glasgow Herald, page 3, column 3 From the timing of publication, one must presume that this news was delivered using the overland telegraph route from Galle in Sri Lanka.for example: \\"Reuters Telegrams\\", 4 Apr 1866, London Standard, page 6, column 2 News by mail was reported on 10 August, giving start dates and the dates of passing Anjer, on the southern side of the Straits of Sunda.\\"The Great Ocean Race from China\\", 10 Aug 1866, Liverpool Daily Post, page 4, column 6 The next reports were of Ariel and Taeping heading up the English Channel,for example \\"Great Ocean Race from China\\", 8 September 1866, Dundee Courier, page 4, column 1 followed by very many reports of the finish in varying degrees of detail. Route Ariel's homeward passage, 1866The sailing route from the China tea ports to London is across the China Sea, then the Indian Ocean, passing Mauritius, rounding the southern tip of Africa into the Atlantic, generally passing to the west of the Azores before turning towards the English Channel. The major variations were in the China Sea, with different strategies to pick up favourable winds. A direct route to the Indian Ocean is through the Sunda Strait. Circumstances (such as a strong south-westerly wind immediately on departure) or a cautious captain may dictate use of the \\"Eastern Passage\\". This meant heading out into the Pacific Ocean, going down the eastern coast of Formosa (Taiwan) and the Philippines, then through the Gillolo Strait, Pitt Passage, and the Ombai Strait into the Indian Ocean. This longer route did not necessarily result in a slow passage: Sir Lancelot took 99 days from Woosung (Wusong) to London by this route in 1867. The distance from Foochow to London is described as being \\"over 14,000 miles\\" by MacGregor. Ariel logged about 15,800 nautical miles from China to London on her 1866 passage. The start of the tea season was during the early stages of the South-West monsoon in the China Sea, so head winds would be experienced, and very light or variable winds together with sudden squalls. Many captains sailing for the Sunda Strait therefore chose to head westward to the coast of Annam (present day Vietnam) to pick up land breezes. This involved tacking at the most favourable moment to be close inshore for the start of the land breeze, often in the middle of the night. Crossing to the Annam coast meant passing the Paracels, an area of low-lying islands and reefs which presented obvious dangers. From the coast of Annam, the usual route was to head south to the coast of Borneo, again to take advantage of land and sea breezes. The crossing of the China Sea frequently decided the overall passage time to London. It also had notable hazards, particularly as accurate, fully surveyed charts did not exist at this time. The five ships leading the 1866 race all headed for the Sunda Strait, sailing past the Paracels, down the coast of Annam and then south to Borneo, bound for Anjer, on the southern side of the Sunda Strait. On passage right Before Ariel had even crossed the bar of the Min River, Captain Keay had the crew working on the fore and aft trim of the ship, a process that continued for over two weeks. Adjustments were needed later in the voyage as stores and water were used. The loaded draft of 18 feet 8 inches forward and 18 feet 3 inches aft was eventually altered to 18 feet 1 inch forward and 18 feet 3 inches aft by moving some of the cargo into the after cabin, and generally moving aft any heavy movable material such as hawsers, casks of salt pork, and spare spars. This improved the steering and general sailing performance. Adjusting the trim went on against the continual background of sail trimming, setting and taking in sails, maintenance work and repairs. In the early part of the race, Ariel sighted Taeping on 2 June, whilst following the coast of Annam (modern Vietnam) - and again on the 9th and 10th, approaching the coast of Borneo, about 760 NM to the south of the previous sighting. On the 10th Taeping, about 4 miles behind, signalled that they had passed Fiery Cross on the 8th. This put Ariel ahead. As the ships progressed across the Indian Ocean and around the southern tip of Africa, the race became closer, the lead shifting between the first three. Serica made up a lot of lost ground by the time they were passing St Helena. The next sighting between any of the participants was on 9 August, when Taeping and Fiery Cross exchanged signals some 12¬∞ north of the Equator, in the Atlantic. Winds were light and variable, so they remained in company until 27 August, when a breeze sprang up which carried Taeping out of sight in four or five hours, whilst Fiery Cross suffered the enormous misfortune to remain becalmed for another 24 hours. The distance between the five ships continued to reduce as they reached the Azores. Ariel, Fiery Cross, Taeping and Serica all passed Flores on 29 August. Taitsing was 48 hours behind them. The next waypoint was entry into the English Channel. Final stages  Tea Race 1866 line chart of relative positions Ariel sighted the Bishop Light at 1:30 am on 5 September 1866. With all possible sail set, she sped toward the mouth of the English Channel. At daybreak, another ship was seen on the starboard quarter, also carrying every stitch of canvas that she could. Captain Keay of Ariel later said \\"Instinct told me that it was the Taeping\\" - and he was right. A strong west- southwesterly wind carried these two ships up the channel at 14 knots. The Lizard was abeam at 8:00 am and Start Point at noon. The two ships were off Portland towards 6:00 pm and St. Catherine's Point was due north at 7:25 pm. Beachy Head was abeam just after midnight. The relative positions of the two ships barely shifted all this while - Ariel kept her lead. At 3:00 am on the 6th, Ariel was approaching Dungeness, so started signalling for a pilot. At 4:00 am she hove to and continued to signal with flares and rockets. Taeping, also signalling for a pilot, was coming up fast and was close astern of Ariel at 5:00 am. There was no sign that Taeping would heave to, so Captain Keay ordered Ariel's sails to be filled to keep ahead of the other ship, to be sure of getting the first pilot. On Taeping, Captain MacKinnon conceded and also hove to. At 5:55 am, the pilot arrived on board Ariel. He saluted Captain Keay with congratulations at being the first ship from China that season. He got the reply \\"Yes, and what is that to the westward? We have not room to boast yet.\\" At 6:00 am, both ships were under way, heading for South Foreland. Despite Taeping resorting to setting some stunsails, Ariel was about a mile ahead. Then both ships signalled for a tug. Here luck was with Taeping, as the better tug put a towline aboard her, so she took the lead as they were towed round the coastline of Kent and into the Thames. Taeping arrived at Gravesend some 55 minutes before Ariel, but that gave her no advantage as both ships then had to wait for the tide to rise sufficiently. Ariel then had the shorter distance to go - arriving outside East India Dock gates at 9:00 pm, but the tide was still too low for the gates to open. Taeping carried on up-river to London Docks. Here, unlike the entrance to the East India Dock, there was an inner and outer set of gates. Taeping's shallower draft allowed her through the outer gates, then they topped up the lock from the dock basin. She passed through at 9:47 pm. Ariel entered East India Dock at 10:15 pm.Cork Examiner - Monday 10 September 1866 page 3, column 7 While Ariel and Taeping were racing up the English coast of the Channel, Serica had been speeding along the French side. She passed through the Downs at noon and just managed, at 11:30 pm, to get into the West India Dock before the lock gates were shut. This meant that these three ships had left China on the same tide, sailed over 14,000 miles in a race lasting 99 days, then all docked in London on the same tide, with less than two hours between them. Fiery Cross was not far behind the first three - she sighted the Isle of Wight at 10:00 am on 7 September but, on arriving in the Downs, was compelled to anchor because the wind had now risen to gale force. She docked in London at 8:00 am on 8 September. Taitsing arrived on the morning of 9 September. Compromise and the end of the premium T. G. Dutton The clippers that sailed at the beginning of the 1866/67 tea season had a premium of 10s per ton written into their bills of lading, payable, by the consignees, to the first ship to dock in London. This is additional to the ordinary rate of freight that had been negotiated - in the case of Ariel in 1866, that was ¬£5 per ton. The \\"ton\\" used in these bills of lading was the \\"freight ton\\", a measurement of volume; British ships loading tea in China at this time used a ton of 50 cubic feet (compared with American ships which used a ton of 40 cubic feet). Normally, the extra payment of the premium would be compensated for by the profits to be made by selling the first of the new crop of tea. In 1866, there was a problem - the first cargo of tea had arrived over two weeks earlier in the steam auxiliary ship Erl King, a ship that was not considered part of the race. The tea merchants were committed to a payment when their tea would sell at a loss. To add to this, the first two tea clippers had signalled off Deal early on the morning of 6 September, followed by a third (Serica) at 1:00 pm. These three ships would create a glut of new season tea, so prices were bound to fall further. The owners and agents of Ariel and Taeping were well aware of the situation that the consignees were in. As soon as their ships had telegraphed from the Downs they became concerned that anything that might be considered a dead heat or a disputed result might lead the consignees to call the race void - there being no outright winner - and so not pay the premium for the first ship to dock. Therefore, they agreed that whichever ship docked first would claim and the other would not dispute the result in any way. In return, the two ships shared the premium between them, and also MacKinnon and Keay shared the ¬£100 prize for the winning ship's captain. This is what happened, Taeping made the claim and shared the money equally with Ariel. The premium payable to the first Tea Clipper to arrive in London was abandoned after the 1866 Tea Race. Beginning of the end for tea clippers Auxiliary steamer Erl King As Ariel, Fiery Cross and the other clippers left Foochow at the end of May 1866, the steam auxiliary Erl King was loading 1,108,100 pounds of tea - she sailed on 5 June, 7 days after Fiery Cross.Liverpool Mercury - Friday 3 August 1866, page 7, column 8 She coaled at Mauritius on 27 June, 22 days later, already ahead of the clippers that had left before her,Stirling Observer - Thursday 30 August 1866, page 6, column 8 and arrived in London on 22 August, 78 days after sailing - taking 77 days on passage, plus one day of coaling.Glasgow Herald - Friday 24 August 1866, page 4, column 6 She was in London 15 days before the first of the clippers. Taeping, as noted above, took 99 days to get from China to London. Newspapers, particularly in Glasgow (where many steamships were built) and Liverpool commented that steam would soon take over carrying tea from China. The same news reports also commented on SS Agamemnon, a true steamer, as opposed to an auxiliary like Erl King. Agamemnon had just completed a record outward passage of 65 days and was on her return trip with a very large cargo of tea. She consumed only 20 tons of coal a day at 10 knots, substantially better fuel economy than other contemporary steamships - a saving of between 23 and 14 tons per day. The confidence of her owners was such that, before proving the profitability of Agamemnon in service, they were building two sister ships, Achilles (1866) and Ajax (1867). The opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 gave a distance saving of 3,300 NM on the route from China to London. Whilst it was possible for a sailing vessel to take a tug through the canal, this was difficult and expensive. Furthermore, sailing conditions in the northern Red Sea were unsuited to the design of a tea clipper. So they still had to sail around Africa. When the tea clippers arrived in China in 1870, they found a big increase in the number of steamers, which were in high demand. The rate of freight to London that was given to steamers was nearly twice that paid to the sailing ships. Additionally, the insurance premium for a cargo of tea in a steamer was substantially cheaper than in a sailing vessel. So successful were the steamers using the Suez Canal that, in 1871, 45 were built in Clyde shipyards alone for Far Eastern trade. As their numbers on this route increased, clippers had to look elsewhere for their work. Costs had to be kept to a minimum - so fewer and less skilled crew were carried. Many ships had their rig reduced to barque so that a smaller crew was needed. The last race between tea clippers to catch public attention was between Thermopylae and Cutty Sark in 1872. Afterwards Erl King was the first ship to carry a cargo of tea through the Suez Canal, arriving in London on 4 August 1870 after a passage of 61 days.\\"Monthly Report on the Tea Market\\", Morning Post - Friday 12 August 1870, pg 8, column 3Sheffield Daily Telegraph - Friday 30 September 1870, pg 2, column 3 She later served on the route to Australia and then on transatlantic routes. She was lost off the coast of Florida on 16 Dec 1891. Captain MacKinnon of Taeping was taken ill with rheumatic fever on his next outward passage and was put ashore in South Africa. He died of complications whilst travelling home to Britain.Glasgow Herald - Friday 22 February 1867, page 4, column 3 Taeping was wrecked in the China Sea in 1871 whilst on passage to New York. Captain Keay moved from Ariel to Oberon in the autumn of 1868 - Ariel disappeared on passage from London to Australia in 1872. It is generally assumed that she was fatally pooped - her fine lines always made her at risk of this. Fiery Cross in later years, with her rig reduced to barque. Serica was wrecked on the Paracels in 1872 en route from Hong Kong to Montevideo, with only one survivor. Fiery Cross carried her last cargo of tea in the 1872/73 tea season and then continued in general trade until, by varying accounts, she was lost either in 1889 or 1893. Taitsing continued in the China trade, carrying her last cargo of tea in 1874/75 (101 days Foochow to New York). She was lost on the Quirimbas Islands in 1883, en route from Swansea to Zanzibar.Aberdeen Journal - Tuesday 2 October 1883 pg 4, column 8 Cutty Sark, built in 1869, in the belief that the Suez Canal and steamships would not take over the tea trade, remains as virtually the sole physical reminder of the tea clipper era that was epitomised by the Great Tea Race of 1866.

Handango offered worldwide distribution, support, and e-commerce services to its partners. The company's customers included consumers, software developers, mobile operators, and original equipment manufacturers. Supported mobile devices included Android devices, Palm handhelds, Windows Mobile devices, Symbian OS devices, and BlackBerry devices. Handango was founded in 1999 by Randy Eisenman. Early founding employees of the company included Eric Matzinger, James Lowe, Andrew Blake, Gabe Bass, Will Pinnell, Rusty Butler, Lindsay Rall, Laura Rippy, Jason Wells, Clint Patterson, Dustin Brown and Bob Weber. Handango was a pioneer of mobile software distribution and is widely credited with many \\"firsts\\" in the distribution of mobile apps including a self-service developer management and reporting portal, the business model of a 70/30 developer revenue split (changed to a 60/40 split in 2005), over-the-air distribution of software with Palm, the industry's first digital rights management deployed with Nokia, and the Handango Commerce Engine that facilitated e-commerce on behalf of the software developer directly from their website. Handango InHand, available from 2003 for Symbian UIQ, from 2004 for Windows Mobile and Palm OS, from 2005 for Blackberry and from 2006 for Symbian S60, is an on-device application store for finding, installing and buying software for your mobile device. Application download and purchasing are completed directly on the device so sync with a computer is not necessary. Description, rating and screenshot are available for any application. Software for using Handango InHand is available for free for Palm OS, Windows Mobile, Symbian UIQ & S60, Blackberry, Android. Handango pioneered this on-air business model for smartphones which achieved great success some years later with similar Apple Inc.'s App Store and Google's Android Market. On February 23, 2010, Jud Bowman of Motricity, a Durham, North Carolina supplier of software and games for mobile phones, acquired Handango, making PocketGear third behind Apple and Google in the app market. While PocketGear remained in Durham, the company kept the Handango offices in the Dallas, Texas area. PocketGear.com, LLC was started in 1998 by Nathan Miller as a teenager, and was later acquired by Motricity. Bowman bought back the smart phone application business in 2008 when Motricity moved from Durham to the Seattle area. Bowman remained a Motricity investor. In February 2011, Handango's new owner PocketGear, Inc. rebranded itself as Appia and shifted its focus to \\"white label\\" mobile app stores - i.e. on-device OEM- branded store apps.

Edholm's law also holds that data rates for these telecommunications categories increase on similar exponential curves, with the slower rates trailing the faster ones by a predictable time lag. Edholm's law predicts that the bandwidth and data rates double every 18 months, which has proven to be true since the 1970s. The trend is evident in the cases of Internet, cellular (mobile), wireless LAN and wireless personal area networks. Concept Edholm's law was proposed by Phil Edholm of Nortel Networks. He observed that telecommunication bandwidth (including Internet access bandwidth) was doubling every 18 months, since the late 1970s through to the early 2000s. This is similar to Moore's law, which predicts an exponential rate of growth for transistor counts. He also found that there was a gradual convergence between wired (e.g. Ethernet), nomadic (e.g. modem and Wi-Fi) and wireless networks (e.g. cellular networks). The name \\"Edholm's law\\" was coined by his colleague, John H. Yoakum, who presented it at a 2004 Internet telephony press conference. Slower communications channels like cellphones and radio modems were predicted to eclipse the capacity of early Ethernet, due to developments in the standards known as UMTS and MIMO, which boosted bandwidth by maximizing antenna usage. Extrapolating forward indicates a convergence between the rates of nomadic and wireless technologies around 2030. In addition, wireless technology could end wireline communication if the cost of the latter's infrastructure remains high. Underlying factors In 2009, Renuka P. Jindal observed the bandwidths of online communication networks rising from bits per second to terabits per second, doubling every 18 months, as predicted by Edholm's law. Jindal identified the following three major underlying factors that have enabled the exponential growth of communication bandwidth. *MOSFET (metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor) The MOSFET (MOS transistor) was invented by Mohamed Atalla and Dawon Kahng at Bell Labs in 1959. It is the basic building block of telecommunications networks, and powers the worldwide Internet with high-speed and low-power MOS integrated circuits. Advances in MOSFET technology (MOS technology) has been the most important contributing factor in the rapid rise of bandwidth in telecommunications networks. Continuous MOSFET scaling, along with various advances in MOS technology, has enabled both Moore's law (transistor counts in integrated circuit chips doubling every two years) and Edholm's law (communication bandwidth doubling every 18 months). *Laser lightwave systems The laser was demonstrated by Charles H. Townes and Arthur Leonard Schawlow at Bell Labs in 1960. Laser technology was later adopted in the design of integrated electronics using MOS technology, leading to the development of lightwave systems around 1980. This has led to exponential growth of bandwidth since the early 1980s. *Information theory Information theory, as enunciated by Claude Shannon at Bell Labs in 1948, provided a theoretical foundation to understand the trade-offs between signal-to-noise ratio, bandwidth, and error-free transmission in the presence of noise, in telecommunications technology. In the early 1980s, Renuka Jindal at Bell Labs used information theory to study the noise behaviour of MOS devices, improving their noise performance and resolving issues that limited their receiver sensitivity and data rates. This led to a significant improvement in the noise performance of MOS technology, and contributed to the wide adoption of MOS technology in lightwave and then wireless terminal applications. The bandwidths of wireless networks have been increasing at a faster pace compared to wired networks. This is due to advances in MOSFET wireless technology enabling the development and growth of digital wireless networks. The wide adoption of RF CMOS (radio frequency CMOS), power MOSFET and LDMOS (lateral diffused MOS) devices led to the development and proliferation of digital wireless networks by the 1990s, with further advances in MOSFET technology leading to rapidly increasing bandwidth since the 2000s. Most of the essential elements of wireless networks are built from MOSFETs, including the mobile transceivers, base station modules, routers, RF power amplifiers, telecommunication circuits, RF circuits, and radio transceivers, in networks such as 2G, 3G, and 4G. In recent years, another enabling factor in the growth of wireless communication networks has been interference alignment, which was discovered by Syed Ali Jafar at the University of California, Irvine. He established it as a general principle, along with Viveck R. Cadambe, in 2008. They introduced \\"a mechanism to align an arbitrarily large number of interferers, leading to the surprising conclusion that wireless networks are not essentially interference limited.\\" This led to the adoption of interference alignment in the design of wireless networks. According to New York University senior researcher Dr. Paul Horn, this \\"revolutionized our understanding of the capacity limits of wireless networks\\" and \\"demonstrated the astounding result that each user in a wireless network can access half of the spectrum without interference from other users, regardless of how many users are sharing the spectrum.\\" See also *History of the Internet *History of telecommunication *Internet access *Internet traffic *Moore's law *Telecommunication ReferencesBibliography * Category:Adages Category:Computing culture Category:Computer architecture statements Category:Computer industry Category:MOSFETs Category:Rules of thumb ","title":"Edholm's law"},{"id":"13433481","text":"The first anime series of Popolocrois Story was released in 1998, and the story is based immediately after the first PlayStation game PoPoLoCrois Monogatari and before the Poporogue game. There have been two different series. The first series is about the adventure after the defeat of the Ice Demon: a girl named \\"Hyuu\\" came to Popolocrois, and the second series is 15 years after Maira's defeat. The second anime series features brand new characters, along with some of the old ones. The main character for the second series is Pinon, who is the son of Pietro and Narcia. The second series is perfectly based on the fourth PlayStation 2 game in Japan, PoPoLoCrois: Adventure of Beginnings (Japanese title: Popolocrois Hajimari no Bouken; official English Title: Popolocrois: A New Departure), and the fifth PlayStation 2 game Popolocrois: Law of the Moon Adventure (Japanese title: Popolocrois Tsuki no Okite no Bouken; official English title: Popolocrois: Enchanted Lunar Tale). In the anime, some colors are different. Pietro's hair is blonde rather than brown (but in the game, it says he's blonde), and White Knight's cape and helmet feather are red instead of blue (in the 1st edition game, they were red, and changed to blue after Popolocrois Monogatari II, the third PlayStation game in Japan. In the PlayStation Portable version, the graphics of II were used). Narcia's eyes are green instead of blue, and there some minor coloring details in some of the secondary characters (Queen Sania, King Paulo and Guilda). *Note: The second animation was produced by Tokyo Movie Shinsha.  Anime characters =First seriesPietro PakaPuka= A main character in the first series. He is the son of the King of Popolocrois, King Paulo, and Sania, one of the daughters of the Ryu clan (which are dragons). He has blond hair, and unlike the game, he wears the clothes that he had in the first two PlayStation games, at the beginning of Popolocrois Monogatari II and in the beginning of the PSP game (with no cape and no crown). It seems like Pietro is still 10 years old rather than 12 because of his childish personality, but he cares deeply about the kingdom. =Narcia= A main character in the first series. She is able to fly without a broom and has a crush on Pietro, and she has less childish personality than Pietro in the beginning. Narcia is able to turn into Kai with her Golden Key, but even though they are the same person, they have split personality. Narcia turns into Kai when she is deeply shy or when she is too scared in some situation, but most of the time she prefers to be just herself. =Kai= Kai is a human-kind that Narcia can transform into, thanks to the help of the Golden Key. Kai shows up in the beginning of the first episode as \\"Tobikera\\", which is the stripped dragon form that it's shown from Kai's attack in the game \\"Dino\\". She has a complete personality change, it's very weird because she also refers herself as Narcia, so she speaks about all the things that Narcia knows in a different way. =Shirokishi= Shirokishi literally translates to ¬®White Knight¬®. Shirokishi is first shown as he is traveling to find the King Knight Sword. Shirokishi speaks in an old-samurai dialect and shows great respect toward Pietro and Narcia. He is extremely skilled in swordsmanship despite his appearance, and also he's very kind and likes to help others (which was the main reason to help everyone he finds in trouble). =Hyuu= A main character in the first series. She is a character only for the anime series. She mysteriously appeared in Flornel Forest after GamiGami Maou (Japanese name for \\"GamiGami Devil\\") had failed to transfer his castle with Popolocrois castle, causing a mysterious beam to strike Flornel Forest which opened a way for Hyuu, Sanda, and Ston to come to Popolocrois. She has a blue hair with a pony tails on each side and one in the back, she has the mysterious \\"Wind-kind\\" crest in her chest. Hyuu is selfish and always state that wind-kinds should be alone and free, but she shows that she wants affection. She is \\"loved\\" by GamiGami because he is under a love spell toward Hyuu, but she actually wants to be with Pietro and actually wants to stay with him forever. =Sanda= A side character in the first series. is a little, fat pink monster that follows Hyuu, he seems to be fascinated by the new world he came into, especially by the food. Both Sanda and Ston are able to transform into giants, Sanda turns into a fat, outgoing giant that wears red Chinese clothes, and is able to create thunders just by the friction of his fingers and control them. Sanda also has the mysterious \\"Wind-kind\\" emblem. Sanda is supposed to be the Japanese pronunciation of \\"thunder\\". =Ston= A side character in the first series. Ston is a yellow, narrow monster that follows Hyuu, Ston always refers Hyuu as a \\"selfish little girl\\" but still follows her. Both Sanda and Ston are able to transform into giants, Ston turns into a tall, very pale giant that wears blue clothes, Ston is able to create Gusts by just blowing, and also he can create windstorms. Ston also has the mysterious \\"Wind-kind\\" emblem. Ston is supposed to be the Japanese pronunciation of \\"storm\\". =GamiGami Maou= The same arrogant character from the game series, also known as GamiGami Devil. He lives in a swamp within his \\"junk castle\\", also with his humanlike robots. GamiGami is supposedly the main antagonist of the series, as he tries to take over the Popolocrois kingdom (which he actually does later in the series), but Pietro and Narcia see GamiGami as a minor threat because of their previous adventures. Second seriesPinon PakaPuka= The main character in the second series. He has short vanilla white hair, wears a white shirt, pants, vest, with the PakaPuka Emblem, also carries around King Paulo's sword (later, he carries the dragon sword). He is the son of Pietro and Narcia and the new prince of Popolocrois, he is very passive in the beginning of the series and just want to read books and study in the castle rather than practice swordplay, go to school, and make friends. He is often compared to his father, Pietro, because everyone expects him to be as great as Pietro was when he was young, but Pinon hates the fact everyone is expecting too much from him. Later, Pinon becomes courageous and starts to stand up for himself, but gets a little discouraged in tough situations, but he is now a man with a strong heart and wants to be a king who can create a world without sadness. Pinon uses the power of the Wind Seirei to use a tornado attack (or an attack that resembles the \\"Wind Cutter\\"/\\"Kaze no Yaiba\\" tech) with his sword. At first he is not mastering it well, but he is able to use it consistently during the fight with Zephys. He actually falls for Luna at the first sight, and he accepts her identity as a water sprite. He is always the one who comfort her when she got very sad. =Luna (Lunattress Andolink)= The main character in the second series. She has a long aqua blue hair, wears a white dress along with a white bandana, and the Golden Key as her necklace. She was first shown when Pinon tried to save Papuu when it was stuck on a little island just off shore, Luna saved Pinon when he almost drowned. Luna seems to know about Pinon but Pinon has no idea why. Later on in the series, Luna reveals her true form when Pinon was once again drowning in the sea, a Mermaid-like Water Sprite. According to Pion (and Marco), when she is in her true form, she is very bright and beautiful. Luna is supposed to be the Princess of the Ocean Sprites but got into a fight with her mother, running away to the Popolocrois beach. Such caused Seilene, her mother to be possessed by Zephys. She is also very kind to others, even to the water sprites who serve her, and she loves them even if they were turned into dark sprites by Zephys. The fact that dark sprites can never turned back to once they were and her mother need to sacrifice herself to seal Zephys that saddens her very much, even after the incident, but she is OK now because Pinon always comfort her when she wanted to cry. She actually loves Pinon, knowing him since very small, and the prime reason she wants to be on land, and she sometimes get jealous when Punpun flirts with Pinon (which Pinon often reluctant to do so). In the last episode, she became the heir after her mother died, and she held hands with Pinon in the ending like Pinon's parents did. =Marco= The main character in the second series. He wears a brown armless shirt, and has tanned skin with three white stripes on his face, a pony tailed hair pointing up, and carries a little axe. He is the son of Leona and quite possibly of the White Knight, he lives in the Flornel Forest, away from Takinen Village with his mother. He is not quite intelligent but still has guts to do something. Marco uses the power of the Fire Seirei to use a fire attack with his axe. =King Pietro= Now the once crowned prince of Popolocrois has become the new king of the kingdom. Pietro has the same brown hair along with beards, he wears the crown of wisdom that was passed down to the kingdom, a dark olive robe with white outlines, with the Pakapuka emblem. Pietro is a strong and wise king like his father, and still the skilled swordsman he was. Now he live with Narcia in the Kingdom. =Seirei= Seirei is compromised in kanji of \\"sei\\"(holy) + \\"rei\\"(spirit). There are 4 different elements: fire, water, earth and wind. One by one they all are threatened by the spirit of darkness (Yasm), but Pinon saves them from being sealed; they repay him by becoming weird animals and accompanying him. There is \\"Hirarin\\", the green \\"Cat-Bat\\", (Wind); \\"Bobo\\", the red \\"Pig-Bird\\" (Fire); and \\"Chappi\\", the blue creature (Water). After the first arc, the seirei just disappear and appear out of nowhere... =Prince Kogoto= He is an adopted child of GamiGami. He is an older brother of PunPun and respects GamiGami. His character looks like the GamiGami well. He builds a robot and plots world conquest. =Princess PunPun= She is an adopted child of GamiGami. She is a younger sister of Kogoto and respects GamiGami. She is strong-minded and is irritable. She loves Pinon and always fights for her love (more like a fangirl) with Luna. =Sielene Andolink= Seilene is the Queen of the Ocean Sprites, who is also the mother of Luna. Before the series begins, Luna wanted to venture onto the land. However, her mother refused because she wanted to shade her daughter from the law of the moon. However, her daughter disliked that and she ran away from home. Such have made a hole on her heart which then used by Zephys to possess her (however, she said it is her stubbornness that caused Zephys able to be possess her) after the defeat of Yasm. After being possessed, she cursed the whole population in Popolocrois (except the trio) to turn into stone under the control of Zephys. Then, she commended the trio who visited her to find the Moon Drop, which she later called Gaude and Pannya to steal it from the trio to her. Then, she arrived at the Petrification Island to undo the Law of the Moon in the Ephemeral Temple. After the abolishment of the Law of the Moon, Zephys left her body for the Ocean half and Sielene become unconscious. After being escorted back to the Croconesia, she came back to her senses and have a walk with Luna on the land for the first and only time. She was astonished and happy to see that her daughter has become stronger and kinder than before she walked on the land. In the final battle with Zephys, Sielene choose to sacrifice herself to reinstate the Law of the Moon in the Aventurine Temple, which has become her resting place because the slab in the Petrification Island stated that the one who commit a sin must atone for it inside the temple walls. =Yasm= A main antagonist of the first arc of the second series. Yasm is the Spirit of Darkness; he devised a plan to destroy the balance of the world by capturing the seirei and sealing their powers. He is first defeated by Pinon with the power of the moon from Papuu. He immediately returned to the human world as a sand dragon, but was again destroyed by Luna's Golden key. There is a mystery behind Yasm, because all the elementals had no human names to begin with, so there is a chance that another was controlling Yasm's plan. =Zephys= The true antagonist in the second series. She was the first king of all sprites when the time only sprites exist. As time flows, the race of humans and dragons appeared and they took place where sprites used to live. Such angered Zephys and she threw a war on the other races to drive them out, and such hatred turned her into the sprite of darkness. Seeing her action, the god used the power of Creation of the wills of light, Duon, to split her into the Ocean half and the Forest half, and sealed them near the Emphemeral (Utakata) Temple on the Petrification Island and near the Aventurine (Isago) Temple in Popolocrois respectively, with only the soul of Zephys able to escape. This created the Law of the Moon (this is the reason why Narucia will turn into air when she touches sea water and Luna will turn into sand when she goes to the land without the golden key). Initially, Zephys created Yasm to weaken the moon so that she can revive. However, such plan fails after Pinon, Luna and Marco destroyed Yasm. She used Seilene, the queen of Ocean sprites and the mother of Luna to break the Moon Drop thus deactivating the Law of the Moon, as well as the seal of the two halves of her body, then she left Seilene to her Ocean half. She was very tough to deal with even just in the half form, let alone the full form. She even turned all water sprites into dark sprites as her army. When Seilene sacrificed herself to reactivate the Law of the Moon, Zephys was split into two once again. However, some of her body part stayed and wanted to kill Luna for revenge, only to be destroyed by Pinon with the Wind Cutter. =Gaude= Voiced by: Taiten Kusunoki, Seiko Tamura (young) Gaude is an Ocean Sprite who is the henchmen of Zephys. In the past, his mother rescued a human boy from being drowned in the seashore, which caused her death (turned into sand because of violation of the Law of the Moon for walking onto the land). Such incident has planted his hatred towards the Law of the Moon and determined to abolish it in any costs, even if it means to work with the Queen of the Dark Sprites. Gaude normally uses a giant crab mecha to fight others and transportation, and it is also used to destroy the Darkart to render the group of Pinon immobile. During the final fight on the seas between the Petrification Island and the Demon Channel, after the Ocean half is unsealed, marco cried for her Mum since he thought he may lose her forever. At this point, Gaude also cried because he is also doing what he has done to save his own mother. A sudden twist in his mind caused him to rescue Pinon and the gang from falling into the Demon Channel, which he fall into it instead. He laughed at himself ironically and met his end after he called her mother for the last time. =Elena Pakapuka= Introduced in the second arc. She is King Pietoro's little sister, and Pinon's aunt. This is the same Elena from the game series, the 3-year-old child that admired Pietoro and Narcia. Now she is 18 years old and now is the boss of her own ship, The Dakart, and she travels around the world for fun. She is an excellent swordsman (skilled enough to do the same technique that Pietro uses, \\"Wind Cutter\\"/\\"Kaze no Yaiba\\") and very commanding, but kind and gentle toward the trio (Pinon, Luna, and Marco) and cares for them, she doesn't like Pinon calling her \\"obasan\\" (Aunt) because calling an 18-year-old girl an aunt isn't really flattering, so she prefers Pinon calling her \\"Oneesan\\" (Big Sister).

The novel tells the story of Emma Lou Morgan, a young black woman with dark skin. It begins in Boise, Idaho and follows Emma Lou in her journey to college at USC and a move to Harlem, New York City for work. Set during the Harlem Renaissance, the novel explores Emma Lou's experiences with colorism, discrimination by lighter-skinned African Americans due to her dark skin. She learns to come to terms with her skin color in order to find satisfaction in her life. Plot summary ;Part 1 Emma Lou Born in Boise, Idaho, Emma Lou Morgan is an African-American girl who has extremely dark skin. Her mother's family have lighter skin that shows European ancestry; the \\"blue-black\\" hue came from her father, who left her and her mother soon after her birth. Believing that her color will reduce her marriageability, her mother's people try to help her lighten her skin with bleaching and commercially available creams, but nothing works. When her mother says \\"a black boy could get along but a black girl would never know anything but sorrow and disappointment,\\" Emma Lou wishes she had been a boy. The only \\"Negro pupil in the entire school,\\" she feels extra conspicuous at graduation among the white faces and white robes. Emma Lou's Uncle Joe encourages her to go to the University of Southern California (USC), where she'll be among black students, and he encourages her to study education and move South to teach. He believes that smaller towns like Boise \\"encouraged stupid color prejudice such as she encountered among the blue vein circle in her home town.\\" Emma Lou‚Äôs maternal grandmother was closely associated with the \\"blue veins\\", black people whose skin was light enough to show veins. Uncle Joe thought life would be better for Emma Lou in Los Angeles, where people had more to think about. At USC, Emma Lou intends to meet the \\"right\\" crowd among other Negro students. On registration day she meets a black girl named Hazel Mason; unfortunately, when she speaks Emma Lou decides that she is the wrong sort, definitely lower- class. Other girls, though pleasant, never invite her into their circles or sorority, especially when they recognize that they've seen her with Hazel, whose \\"minstrel\\" demeanor is not good for the black image. When Hazel drops out of school, Grace Giles become Emma Lou's friend but informs her that the sorority only accepts wealthy, light-skinned girls. Emma Lou begins to notice that black leaders tend to have light skin or light-skinned wives. By summer vacation, she feels more trapped by her skin. Back in Boise, Emma Lou meets Weldon Taylor at a picnic. Although darker than her ideal, he attracts her, and she ends up going too far with him that night, thinking she is in love. Over the next two weeks, she is thrilled to be with Taylor, for \\"his presence and his love making.\\" He had been to college but temporarily dropped out to build up his tuition fund, traveling from town to town, finding work and a new girl each time. When he announced that he was leaving Boise to become a Pullman porter, Emma Lou blamed her color. She puts in the rest of her college time, then moves to New York City to find work‚Äîand hopefully, a better life. ;Part 2 Harlem In Harlem, Emma Lou meets a young man named John whom she decides is \\"too dark.\\" She heads to an employment agency seeking work as a stenographer; lacking experience, she pads her account of her skills. She is sent to a real-estate office for an interview, only to be told that they have someone else in mind. She returns to the agency and the manager, Mrs. Blake, invites her to lunch, and Emma Lou is \\"warmed toward any suggestion of friendliness\\" and excited to have the chance \\"to make a welcome contact.\\" Mrs. Blake tells her about work prospects, saying that black businessmen preferred to hire light-skinned, pretty girls; she advises Emma Lou to go to Columbia Teachers' College and train for a job in the public-school system. After lunch, Emma is walking on Seventh Avenue and while stopping to check her reflection, she notices a few young black men nearby and hears one comment, \\"There‚Äôs a girl for you ‚ÄòFats‚Äô\\", to which the reply is: \\"Man, you know I don‚Äôt haul no coal.\\" ;Part 3 Alva Determined to stay in New York, Emma Lou finds a job as a maid to Arline Strange, an actress \\"in an alleged melodrama about Negro life in Harlem.\\" She thinks all the characters are caricatures. Arline and her brother from Chicago take Emma Lou to her first cabaret one night, where he makes her a drink from his hip flask. Emma Lou, entranced by the dancing, gets to be part of it when a man from another table, Alva, invites her. When the lights go up, he returns her to sit with Arline and her brother. The next morning, Alva and his roommate Braxton discuss the previous evening, agreeing that Alva did Emma Lou a favor in dancing with her. Intrigued by the cabaret, Emma Lou talks to the stage director about being in the dance chorus. He tells her plainly the girls are chosen in part for appearance, and notes they all have lighter skin than hers. She decides to look for a new place to live, hoping to meet \\"the right sort of people.\\" One evening she goes to a casino, where she recognizes Alva. When she approaches him and asks if he remembers her, he politely acts like he does: he talks to her, dances with her, and even gives her his phone number. She calls him a couple of times before they make plans. Braxton is critical of Alva's seeing her, but he thinks, \\"She‚Äôs just as good as the rest, and you know what they say, ‚ÄòThe Blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice.‚Äô\\" ;Part 4 Rent Party After avoiding taking Emma Lou to parties or dances, not wanting his friends to meet her (preferring to be seen with light-skinned Geraldine), Alva finally takes her to a \\"rent party. Used to manipulating young women for money, Alva liked Geraldine for herself. Emma Lou was very excited about the party, and worried that she would encounter more discrimination. Once there, they happened on to a conversation revolving around race: the differences between being a mulatto and a Negro, and individuals who are prejudiced or \\"color struck.\\" At the rent party, Emma had consumed more alcohol than usual, and the next morning her landlady demands that she find somewhere else to stay. As the woman speaks, Emma Lou remembers a little more about Alva bringing her home after the party and realizes that the woman might be right that her behavior hadn't met the boardinghouse's respectable standards. Emma Lou thought more about Alva, who seemed kinder than others in her life, but she was aware of his manipulation. Alva has his own trouble with Braxton: he has no job and pays no rent. When Braxton finally moves out, Alva doesn't want Emma Lou to move in. One night the couple goes to a theatre, but Emma Lou doesn't have a good time: \\"You‚Äôre always taking me some place, or placing me in some position where I‚Äôll be insulted.\\" One night, after an argument with Emma Lou, Alva returns to his room to find Geraldine sleeping in his bed; when she wakens, she announces that she's pregnant by him. ;Part 5 Pyrrhic Victory Two years later, Emma Lou works as a personal maid/companion to Clere Sloane, a retired actress married to Campbell Kitchen, a white writer very interested in Harlem. He encouraged Emma Lou to seek more education in order to achieve economic independence. She has few friends and still feels very out-of-place. When she tries to see Alva after they had stopped seeing each other for a time, Geraldine answers the door and Emma Lou leaves without comment. Geraldine and Alva's son has been born disfigured and possibly retarded and seems to bring them endless trouble; they often wish he would die. Geraldine blames Alva‚Äîanother man would have made a better baby‚Äîand her mother blames both of them for not bothering to marry before his birth (or conception). Alva has become a money-wasting alcoholic; Geraldine works hard, trying to build up an escape fund. Having moved to the Y.W.C.A., Emma Lou has found some new friends and is studying teaching. She continues to work hard but to feel no better about her appearance, although her friend Gwendolyn Johnson tries to help her. She starts seeing Benson Brown, a light-skinned man described as a \\"yaller nigger.\\" His appearance seems reason enough to see him. But when she learns that Geraldine had abandoned Alva and their son, she goes to check on them and he soon has her taking care of little Alva Jr. After 6 months, she begins teaching at a Harlem public school, wearing much dark-skin-concealing makeup but being teased for it by colleagues. She nurtures the child better than his parents ever did, but she and Alva have a rocky relationship. As Emma Lou gains more economic independence, she discovers that it isn't everything; she's still not happy. She decides to leave Alva and his son. When she returns to the Y.W.C.A. she contacts Benson, who announces that he and Gwendolyn have been dating and have decided to marry. They even invite her to the wedding. Emma Lou realizes she has spent her life running: she ran from Boise's color prejudice; she left Los Angeles for similar reasons. But she decides never to run again. She knows there are many people like her and that she has to accept herself. Characters *Emma Lou Morgan: a young African-American woman.

He is lighter-skinned and promising, the \\"right\\" sort of African-American man. Influence Thurman's novel has been widely discussed. Through Emma Lou Morgan, he expressed the idea that dark skin presented more problems for a woman than a man. The young woman struggles with people's reactions to her. Variations in skin tone has historically related to European and Native American ancestry among African Americans, and the tangled history of slave societies, and benefits that some mixed-race children received from white fathers. The topic of behavior related to differing skin tones has since been treated by other artists and writers, and the issue of skin bias has been studied as a sociological and psychological issue among academics. Despite the calls for Black Power and \\"Black is beautiful\\" in the mid-twentieth century, studies have found that skin tone bias continues. It is more openly discussed, studied and, at times, mocked. The director Spike Lee has explored this topic, particularly in his film School Daze (1988), about students at a prestigious college (modeled on Spelman College and Morehouse College). In 2001 Maxine S. Thompson and Verna M. Keith presented the results of a study on gender, skin tone and self efficacy. They found darker skin more problematic for women, for whom skin tone had more effect on self-esteem, especially for lower and working class women. Higher class women could escape the effects of skin color by other accomplishments. Skin tone presented less of a self-esteem issue for men, but did affect their sense of self-efficacy. In 2004 Daniel Scott III published an article noting that Thurman was interested in Harlem in the 1920s as a place for personal transformation. He was aware that people were attracted there from all over the United States, and brought expectations with them. The experience of living there opened them to new possibilities, which he expressed in his first novel. People were stimulated by meeting many new strangers, and by opportunities afforded by clubs, cabarets, concert halls, theatres and other venues. The novel's line \\"the blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice\\" is referenced in Tupac Shakur's 1993 song Keep Ya Head Up, as well as Pharoahe Monch's 2007 song Let's Go and \\"Run and Tell That\\" from the musical Hairspray. Kendrick Lamar's 2015 song The Blacker the Berry is named after the novel.

He also founded the Fort Burgwin Research Center and Department of Anthropology at Southern Methodist University, where he was Henderson-Morrison Professor of Prehistory. He won numerous awards throughout his career and was a member of the United States National Academy of Sciences. Biography Wendorf had an interest in the field of archaeology ever since his childhood when at the age of 8 Wendorf began to find and collect arrowheads. Wendorf started studying archaeology collegiately in 1942 at the University of Arizona. However, it was cut short due to serving in World War II. Wendorf resumed his studies one year later after suffering a battle wound to his arm. This injury and the experience behind it earned Wendorf a Purple Heart and a Bronze Star. Wendorf continued his college education at colleges close to whatever military hospital he was reporting to. This included the University of Michigan. Wendorf received his bachelors from the University of Arizona in 1948, then his doctorate degree of Harvard University in 1953. Wendorf's first archaeology job was in New Mexico at a construction site of a natural gas pipeline. This involved Wendorf excavating roughly one hundred and fifty sites off this pipeline. He then became a research archaeologist with the Museum of New Mexico in Santa Fe. Soon after Wendorf was contacted by an amateur archaeologist about the remains of human bone fragments that he had previously found around Midland. This excavation took place at what is now known as the ‚ÄúMidland Man‚Äù site and was a milestone for Wendorf. Following this excavation Wendorf joined the staff of what is now Texas Tech University where he held the first ever summer archaeological field school. In 1958 he went back to being the associate director at the Museum of New Mexico. Wendorf was one of the first archaeologists to answer an international plea to excavate along the Nile River Valley. Wendorf created SMU‚Äôs anthropology department in 1964. At this time Wendorf switched his archaeological focus from the American Southwest to northeast Africa. Wendorf expanded his work by getting involved in the protection of historical shipwrecks. His investigations eventually led to the Abandoned Shipwreck act of 1987, which protects historical shipwrecks the United States. Wendorf was the director of The Combined Prehistoric Expedition until 1999. This expedition was in Africa and covered from the early stone age till around to late Bronze Age and has given us a tremendous amount of insight on behavior during those historic times along the Nile and in the desserts. Wendorf's work has won him many awards including; ¬∑ Elected into the national academy of sciences in 1987 ¬∑ Received a medal from the supreme council of antiques of Egypt in 1974 ¬∑ Received a Lucy Wharton Drexl Medal for archaeological achievement in 1996. Wendorf retired in 2003. Wendorf died on Wednesday, July 15, 2015 due to a long term illness. He was a father to his three daughters, Gail Wendorf, Cindy Ruiz and Kelly Wendorf, and to his three sons, Carl Wendorf, Michael Wendorf and Scott Wendorf. Denver Fred Wendorf was a husband to his wife Christy Bednar and a brother to his sisters, Mildred DiMaggio and Mary Ann Stripling. Bibliography * * (with Romuald Schild, Angela E.

The practice creates a neighborhood stock system in which community shares are sold. The term \\"District Regionalism\\" was initially used by the administration of the city of Guthrie, Kentucky as the distinctive traits of each neighborhood emerged during the trial study. The University of Kentucky's College of Design became instrumental in devising the study concept, parameters and goals. The practice concerns organizing cities into smaller communities by allowing creating and distinctive regional and cultural references emerge within neighborhoods by allowing the public to transform what is typically considered as government owned areas and blighted properties. The practice has been proven to alter larger sprawling co-dependent cities into smaller self-reliant communities.  Share System  Community shares are sold in District Regionalist environments. As a community is defined by boundaries and image, the collective population of that community issues shares with monetary value. Initially, stock ownership is given to the community in order to promote the process. An increased number of shares allows a larger number of voting privileges within that community, therefore allowing some margin within city ordinances and zoning. As more community shares are sold, the pool increases for that community allowing them greater ability to project that money towards community projects. In a District Regionalist community, the city never loses over 51% of shares, allowing the city government to retain rights to city property and have majority rule voting privileges. As improvements are made to community properties, land values increase and improve the value of private properties within those districts. Cities can also use the community district funding pool to match grants at the discretion of a district's approval. The share system operates on the premise that communities will care for what they own, as opposed to caring for properties owned by cities.

It is a shrub with small, egg-shaped leaves and massed displays of scented pink to red flowers in spring. Description Verticordia forrestii is a highly branched, often dense shrub which grows to a height of . Its leaves are egg-shaped to almost round but have a pointed end and are long. The flowers are scented and arranged in short, spike-like groups on thick, spreading stems long and the flowers open at about the same time as each other. The floral cup is broadly top-shaped, long, glabrous, warty and has 5 ribs and green appendages about long. The sepals are pale to bright pink or dark reddish-pink, fading to white, or sometimes white, long, with 9 to 13 feathery lobes and two small, hairy, ear-like appendages. The petals are erect and a similar colour to the sepals, long, with a hairy fringe. The style is long, bent at first but gradually straightening and has hairs mainly on one side. Flowering time is from July to November. Taxonomy and naming Verticordia forrestii was first formally described by Ferdinand von Mueller in 1883 and the description was published in Southern Science Record. The specific epithet (forrestii) honours Forrest, the explorer and statesman who made the type collection near the Gascoyne River in 1882. When Alex George reviewed the genus Verticordia in 1991, he placed this species in subgenus Eperephes, section Pennuligera along with V. comosa, V. lepidophylla, V. chrysostachys, V. aereiflora, V. dichroma, V. x eurardyensis, V. muelleriana, V. argentea, V. albida, V. fragrans, V. venusta, V. serotina, V. oculata, V. etheliana and V. grandis. Distribution and habitat This verticordia grows in deep sand on sand dunes in open shrubland. It occurs between Carnarvon and Onslow near the coast, inland as far as Ashburton Downs and Wiluna, south-east to the Kennedy Range and almost to the Wooramel River, in the Carnarvon, Gascoyne, Murchison and Pilbara biogeographic regions. An early collection was made further northeast, at Roebourne, although it has not been found since then. Ecology The flowers of V. forrestii are often visited by small bees, (Euryhesma forrestii) from the Family Colletidae. Conservation Verticordia forrestii is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife. Use in horticulture This verticordia is an ornamental shrub, usually no more than high in cultivation. It is best suited to warmer climates. The flowers first appear during November, continuing until April, opening together and nearly covering the leaves and branches. It has been propagated from both cuttings and seed and grows best in sandy soil in a sunny position.

He began his professional career in 1964 working with still-life objects and eventually broadened his horizons by doing portraits. Spindel also incorporates baseball memorabilia in collage form in some of his work. He is probably best known for photographing John Lennon and Yoko Ono during Lennon's last recording sessions for Double Fantasy in 1980.  Biography  Spindel grew up in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn, New York and graduated from Rochester Institute of Technology in 1964 (studying under such photographers as Minor White, professor Leslie Stroebel, Richard D. Zakia, Ralph Hattersley and Robert Bagby). He worked as a photo assistant for 6 years until his employer at that time, Tosh Matsumoto, encouraged him to open his own studio. Throughout his commercial career, Spindel was featured in major newspapers, magazines and art publications. Television shows in the U.S. and abroad have featured segments on his approach to photography. After 28 years in commercial advertising, Spindel began creating an interactive body of work called \\"Rebuses.\\" Webster‚Äôs dictionary defines a rebus as representation of words or phrases by means of pictures or objects whose names resemble those words or phrases; a form of riddle composed of such pictures. Spindel's rebuses have been quoted as being \\"unexpectedly different and more fun than finding one of Hirshfeld‚Äôs Ninas\\". Ranging in subjects from all-time favorite celebrities to frequently used everyday expressions, Spindel's rebuses are an outpouring of his inexhaustible sense of humor. Notable fans and collectors of Spindel's work include: Charlton Heston, Hillary Clinton, Dr. Ruth Westheimer, Marty Allen, Stiller and Meara, Anne Jackson, Eli Wallach, Chuck Connors, Donald Trump, Jerry Lewis, Lou Jacobi, Billy Crystal and Kate Hepburn. Regis Philbin said, ‚ÄúDavid is a little eccentric but you have to put up with it when someone is a genius‚Äù. Bette Davis once said, ‚ÄúDavid‚Äôs art is wondrous‚Äù. Michael Eisner thought his photography was extraordinary and recommended it to the sports division of Disney. Joe DiMaggio greatly admired Spindel‚Äôs talent and posed for a portrait with his own personal memorabilia. In 1992, Abbeville Press released The Bronx Bombers and The Boston Red Sox, the first two titles in the award winning, eight-volume Major League Memories series. Each book chronicles a major league baseball team‚Äôs history, in scrapbook form, from inception to present day. In 2014 Master PIece puzzle commissioned David to create one of his unique collages on the life of John Wayne. It is titled \\"Remembering the Duke\\". they also licensed 4 of his sports images for 1000 piece puzzles. On the eve of John Lennon birthday in 2015, CNN licensed several of his photographs for a special documentary they were creating. Spindel is also known for donating his photographs to charitable organizations. He has raised funds for the Leukemia Society of America, The Mid Hudson Children‚Äôs Museum, A.L.S., Baseball Assistance Team (BAT), Lupus, The Heart Fund, Yogi Berra‚Äôs and Phil Rizzuto‚Äôs favorite charities (Handicapped Boy Scouts of Southern NJ and St. Joseph‚Äôs School for the Blind) and numerous family shelters.

Retrieved 15 April 2012 is a small town on the right bank of River Indus, in district Thatta, province of Sindh, Pakistan.  History  In the 19th century, Jhirk was the busiest river port and centre of commercial activity in Sindh. It also served as the headquarters of the Indus flotilla, the most modern navigational system of those days. Karachi Port near Karachi was connected to Jhirk. The headquarters of the Indus flotilla was in Jhirk town near Kotri and then it went to Mithankot Rajanpur district near Dera Ghazi Khan and then to the last point Makhad Attock. This part of Indus flotilla was called Punjab flotilla and the Indus flotilla Interchangeably. The British Indus flotilla of steamboats which once plied the Indus river is described by (Shaw 1998). Hassan Ali Effendi the famous educationist who was instrumental in Establishing Sindh Madrasatul Islam used to Work at Indus flotilla in his early years while learning English. Quaid-i-Azam Mohammed Ali Jinnah was one of his students at Sindh Madrasatul Islam Karachi. The river Indus was an important artery of communication between Karachi and Jhirk near Kotri Sindh, was an important river port, the Indus flotilla used large quantities of firewood and it was kept to fuel steamboats. Hassan Ali Effendi kept account of the incoming and outgoing wood and Steamboats. It was because of the commercial importance of the town that the Aga Khan the first or Awal in Urdu/ Persian, constructed his palace over there. Another testimony to the importance of Jhirk is that one of the oldest British era schools in Sindh, 15 years older than Karachi's Sindh Madrasatul Islam, was also established in Jhirk, and is still functioning there. This historical village is situated on the National Highway from Hyderabad to Thatta at 50 km, which near Keenjhar Lake 26 km ahead. It is on the right bank of River Indus 400 feet high above the sea level on the little mountains. During British rule, it was an important place for the English rulers to reside. The English Capt April Spy of British crown in 1800s especially describes the majesty and weather of the city. He was stationed here from 1832 to 1839 writes that this was a great city consisting of a Bazaar of 200 shops and goods were available here at cheaper prices than Karachi. Aga Khan I migrated from Iran to Afghanistan Hirat, after the First Afghan War of 1839, when British were in Hirat. After British defeat at hands of Amir Akbar son of Amir Dost Mohammed of Afghanistan. He then settled himself in Jhirk in Sindh in 1843 under British protection. Aga Khan I built his Mahal (Palace) which is still exists in same good condition. He and his followers which were at least one thousand strong and with their residences there in Jhirk. The British were there too to protect him. Sir Charles Napier initially made Jhirk the headquarters for the British Army in Sindh when he came to Sindh which was part of Bombay at that time. The Grandfather of Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah, who come to visit Jhirk for his Aga Khan I Hassan Ali Shah Imam‚Äôs Deedar settled here for the rest of his life and is buried there too and his grave can be found there. His elder son, Jinnahbhai Poonja, father of Mohammed Ali Jinnah, was married to Sheeren Bai, the daughter of Moosa Jumo in 1874, who had also migrated along with the Agha Khan. Some believe that Muhammad Ali Jinnah was born in Jhirk, \\"but most historians and biographers go along with the official line\\".Remembering the Quaid - Daily Dawn This is however important that a Maternity Home built by Agha Khan community was described by the Archaeology Department as the proper birthplace of Quaid e Azam and a blue plate remained fixed on the same with such information by the Department for over 2 decades after partition. He was admitted in the primary school of the town established in 1870. The school's General Register is missing. Before this controversy when the announcement of his Birth Place was made in the teaching course taught in Pakistan until 1962. It was written as Jhirk in the 8th lesson of the course till 1962 in the Books from primary to Graduation level and remained in all level of books up to the tenure of Prime Minister of Pakistan Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto 1976. Then it was changed to Wazir Mansion (Karachi) near Light House Karachi as Quaid-i- Azam Birth Place and a Fresh controversy arose again about birthplace of Quaid e Azam and a change was made during Gen Zia Government, it was again admitted in the books that Karachi was birth Place of Quaid-e-Azam. A Buddha Stupa on the other side of river Indus indicates the historical position of the city. Despite having a brilliant past, Jhirk present situation is very critical. Very little income sources are found in this city. People are dependent on special Aid and Grants from Government. While the rest of the population is Living Below the Poverty Line now. Due to the lack of water in Kotri, river. Jhirk town has been deserted by people. All sources of fishing and farming are totally depleted. Many Government employees live here. Many Graduates and Higher Secondary Pass-out youth from the Mallah Fishermen community pass their life selling brambles or on meagre rural Income resources.

The church and its cemetery are located at the southwest corner of Glebe Road and 16th Street North. History On March 12, 1855, John B. Brown and his wife Cornelia, and William Marcy and his wife Ann, resolved an ownership dispute over the church site property by each deeding that property in trust for a Methodist Protestant Church meetinghouse and burial ground. George C. Wunder, the owner of a nearby farm, made the first contribution to the church building fund in the amount of one hundred dollars (equivalent to more than eight thousand dollars today). The cornerstone for the first building, a two story structure approximately 35 feet by 50 feet in size, was laid in 1855 and the building was completed in 1860, the year before the American Civil War began. In the summer of 1861, Union soldiers retreating from the First Battle of Bull Run encamped near the church and commandeered it for use as a hospital and then a stable. The soldiers later dismantled the church building to provide firewood and other supplies for the war effort, but a tiny congregation persevered and built another small meetinghouse on the site in 1870. The 1870 meetinghouse was remodeled in 1875 and remained until 1897 when a larger church was built. In 1920, an education wing was added to the south side of the building and the bell tower and vestibule were relocated. After the Second World War, rapid population growth in the area spurred the construction of a larger church. Construction completed in 1949 added a new sanctuary, a social hall and a kitchen, as well as the stylized tall steeple that adorns the church to this day. In 1954, a two-story north wing with a chapel, church offices and classrooms was added. In 1962, the sanctuary was expanded and a two story south wing with additional classrooms was added. Most recently, construction in 1997 renovated the sanctuary, added an elevator for handicapped access, expanded the chancel, created a gathering space, renovated and added classrooms, and created a Columbarium. The Mount Olivet cemetery adjacent to the church is part of the original land deeded in trust in 1854. The burial records were destroyed in a fire in 1920 and information on the grave sites is largely limited to what is inscribed on the tombstones. Among those buried in the Mount Olivet cemetery is Sue Landon Vaughan, one of the founders of Decoration Day (now Memorial Day), who in 1865 began the practice of decorating the graves of Civil War dead, both Confederate and Union. The church is a United Methodist Church. As of June 30, 2007, the church had a membership of 1,262 and an average Sunday worship attendance of 411. On January 24, 2004, the Arlington County Board issued a proclamation commemorating the church‚Äôs 150th anniversary and recognizing that ‚ÄúMount Olivet‚Äôs members continue to play an active and vital role in the Arlington community, contributing human and financial resources to a myriad of charitable organizations in Arlington and other communities throughout the country and the world‚Äù.  Name  Tradition says that Oliver Cox, a young minister in 1854 when the first meetinghouse was built, named the church after the Mount of Olives, the site east of Jerusalem where the Bible says that Jesus preached to his disciples.

It was founded in 2007 by Governor Phil Bredesen as part of an effort to provide challenges for students across the academic spectrum. Its inaugural class consisted of 24 high school juniors from throughout the state. The Academy was closed on May 31, 2011, due to lack of state funding. Curriculum=Pre-Calculus Pre-Calculus served as the introductory mathematics class at TGA for those who had not taken the course elsewhere or those who are not prepared to take Calculus upon arrival at TGA. The course was similar in content to the Math 130 course offered at the University of Tennessee at Knoxville. Generally speaking, the course content serves to prepare juniors to take Calculus during the Spring semester of the junior year. Content includes a review of algebraic, logarithmic, exponential, and trigonometric functions. Calculus The calculus course was designed by professors at the University of Tennessee at Knoxville and based on Math 141 for the first semester and Math 142 for the second semester of the TGA calculus course. Mathematics for the Life Sciences Mathematics for the Life Sciences, commonly MLS, was designed by professors at the University of Tennessee at Knoxville and based on Math 151. MLS provided an introduction to a variety of mathematical topics of use in analyzing problems arising in the biological sciences. Physics Also designed by university professors, this course was modeled on Physics 135, an introduction to Physics for Math and Physical Science Majors at the University. The course was calculus-based, but because most students entering TGA had no prior knowledge of calculus, began with topics for which the calculus is either unnecessary, not required by the curriculum set by the state, or easily taught around. Humanities At TGA, the Humanities course was designed to fulfill the requirements for the curriculum of the State of Tennessee for American History and English III. Student life=Cottage life The students at the Tennessee Governor's Academy lived in cottages on the Tennessee School for the Deaf campus. The facilities were furnished by the University of Tennessee and the State. Each cottage consists of six student rooms and two hall director rooms. The cottage is divided into two wings, each consisting of three bedrooms which are shared by two students each. Each cottage has a full kitchen, dining area, classroom, and living room, and classes are held in the cottages. House system During the early first semester, the students were divided into four \\"houses,\\" modeled after residential housing systems. TGA's houses were named Copernicus, Divinitus, Illuminati, and Renaissance, and each was headed by a hall director or assistant hall director. Though meant to be a long lasting legacy, the housing system served only as a temporary chore-organizing plan. Over the 2007/08 winter break, a change in housing staff caused the house system to be reformed from four to three houses, each with new leadership. At the beginning of the 2008/09 school year, the house system (along with most of the structure of TGA) was completely reorganized. The teachers assigned the names to the houses, which are all named for deceased mathematicians or scientists: Cannon, Drew, Von Neumann, and Tesla.

Life Dietmar Bonnen studied music and fine arts in Cologne and D√ºsseldorf. In 1981 he founded the avantgarde-rock ensemble Fleisch, with whom he recorded several CDs with his own compositions. After two years of production he published a CD called ‚ÄúBonnen spielt ‚Ä¶‚Äù with organ music of the 20th century. This production was the first, which combined different organs and acoustics from different churches made possible by recording techniques taken from pop music. Beside works of Gy√∂rgy Ligeti, Paul Hindemith, Charles Ives and Max Reger, he also played compositions written especially for this project and that cannot be performed on conventional organs.

Later, Bonnen produced several CDs in several different musical genres, as for example the soundscape-composition ‚ÄúBonnen in Beijing‚Äù, recorded 1993/94 for WDR in Beijing and Cologne. Other works present music of other composers in new arrangements. Examples are CDs with music of Frank Zappa, Hildegard von Bingen, Jimi Hendrix, Kurt Weill, Willie Dixon and Claudio Monteverdi. Concerts in Europe, Asia, South America and especially Russia led to intensive collaborations with foreign artists and to the foundation of the ‚ÄúRussian- German Composers Quartet‚Äù with Alexei Aigui and Ivan Glebovich Sokolov from Moscow, Manfred Niehaus and Dietmar Bonnen from Cologne.

Generally, it involves comparisons of social processes across times and places. It overlaps with historical sociology. While the disciplines of history and sociology have always been connected, they have connected in different ways at different times. This form of research may use any of several theoretical orientations. It is distinguished by the types of questions it asks, not the theoretical framework it employs.  Major researchers  Some commentators have identified three waves of historical comparative research.J. Adams, E.S. Clemens, and A.S. Orloff. 2005. Remaking Modernity: Politics, History, and Sociology. Duke University Press. The first wave of historical comparative research concerned how societies came to be modern, i.e. based on individual and rational action, with exact definitions varying widely. Some of the major researchers in this mode were Alexis de Tocqueville,For example, Democracy In America. 1969 [1835-40]. Trans. George Lawrence. Perennial Classics. Karl Marx,For example, \\"The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte.\\" 1979 [1852]. In Marx/Engels Collected Works, Vol. 11. International Publishers. pg. 99-197. Emile Durkheim,For example, The Division of Labor in Society. 1984 [1893]. Trans. W.D. Halls. The Free Press. Max Weber,For example, Economy And Society: An Outline of Interpretive Sociology. 1968 [1922]. Ed. Guenther Roth and Claus Wittich. University of California Press. and W.E.B. Du Bois.For example, The Suppression of the African Slave Trade to the United States of America 1638-1870. In W.E.B. Du Bois Writings. Library of America. pg. 1-356. The second wave reacted to a perceived ahistorical body of theory and sought to show how social systems were not static, but developed over time.D. Smith. 1991. The Rise of Historical Sociology. Temple University Press. Notable authors of this wave include Barrington Moore, Jr.,For example, Social Origins of Dictatorship and Democracy: Lord and Peasant in the Making of the Modern World. 1966. Beacon Press. Theda Skocpol,For example, States and Social Revolutions: A Comparative Analysis of France, Russia, and China. 1979. Cambridge University Press. Charles Tilly,For example, Coercion, Capital, and European States, AD 990-1992. 1992. Blackwell Publishing. Michael Mann,For example, The Sources of Social Power, Vols. 1-2. 1986-93. Cambridge University Press. and Mark Gould.Revolution in the Development of Capitalism: The Coming of the English Revolution. 1987. University of California Press. Some have placed the Annales school and Pierre Bourdieu in this general group, despite their stylistic differences.For example, P. Bourdieu. 1988 [1984]. Homo Academicus. Trans. Peter Collier. Stanford University Press. The current wave of historical comparative research sociology is often but not exclusively post-structural in its theoretical orientation. Influential current authors include Julia Adams,For example, \\"The Rule of the Father: Patriarchy and Patrimonialism in Early Modern Europe.\\" 2005. In Max Weber's Economy and Society: A Critical Companion. Ed. C. Camic, P.S. Gorski, and D.M. Trubek.

Mahoney. 2003. \\"Knowledge Accumulation in Comparative Historical Research: The Case of Democracy and Authoritarianism.\\" In Comparative Historical Analysis in the Social Sciences. Ed. J. Mahoney and D. Rueschemeyer. Cambridge University Press.  Methods  There are four major methods that researchers use to collect historical data. These are archival data, secondary sources, running records, and recollections. The archival data, or primary sources, are typically the resources that researchers rely most heavily on. Archival data includes official documents and other items that would be found in archives, museums, etc. Secondary sources are the works of other historians who have written history. Running records are ongoing series of statistical or other sorts of data, such as census data, ship's registries, property deeds, etc. Finally recollections include sources such as autobiographies, memoirs or diaries. There are four stages, as discussed by Schutt, to systematic qualitative comparative historical studies: (1) develop the premise of the investigation, identifying events, concepts, etc., that may explain the phenomena; (2) choose the case(s) (location- nation, region) to examine; (3) use what Theda Skocpol has termed as \\"interpretive historical sociology\\" and examine the similarities and the differences; and (4) based on the information gathered, propose a causal explanation for the phenomena. The key issues in methods for historical comparative research stem from the incomplete nature of historical data, the complexity and scale of the social systems, and the nature of the questions asked. Historical data is a difficult set of data to work with due to multiple factors. This data set can be very biased, such as diaries, memoirs, letters, which are all influenced not only by the person writing them, that person's world view but can also, logically, be linked to that individual's socioeconomic status. In this way the data can be corrupt/skewed. Historical data regardless or whether it may or may not be biased (diaries vs. official documents) is also vulnerable to time. Time can destroy fragile paper, fade ink until it is illegible, wars, environmental disasters can all destroy data and special interest groups can destroy mass amounts of data to serve a specific purpose at the time they lived, etc. Hence, data is naturally incomplete and can lead social scientists to many barriers in their research. Often historical comparative research is a broad and wide reaching topic such as how democracy evolved in three specific regions. Tracking how democracy developed is a daunting task for one country or region let alone three. Here the scale of the social system, which is attempting to be studied, is overwhelming but also the complexity is extreme. Within each case there are multiple different social systems that can affect the development of a society and its political system. The factors must be separated and analyzed so that causality can be attained. It is causality that brings us to yet another key issue in methods for historical comparative research, the nature of the questions which are asked is attempting to propose causal relationships between a set of variables. Determining causality alone is a difficult task; coupled with the incomplete nature of historical data and the complexity and scale of the social systems being used to examine causality the task becomes even more challenging. Theda Skocpol and Margaret Somers argued that there were three types of comparative history research: * comparative history as macro-causal analysis - the emphasis is on identifying both relevant differences and similarities across cases in an attempt to test hypotheses or build theory * comparative history as parallel demonstration of theory ‚Äì the emphasis is on identifying similarities across relevant cases * comparative history as contrast of contexts ‚Äì the emphasis is on the differences between cases and the uniqueness of each case. Scholars that use this approach tends to be wary of drawing broad generalizations.  Identifying features  The three identifying issues of historical comparative research are causal relationships, processes over time, and comparisons. As mentioned above causal relationships are difficult to support although we make causal assumptions daily. Schutt discusses the five criteria, which must be met in order to have a causal relationship. Of the five the first three are the most important: association, time order and nonspuriousness. Association simply means that between two variables; the change in one variable is related to the change in another variable. Time order refers to the fact that the cause (the independent variable) must be shown to have occurred first and the effect (the dependent variable) to have occurred second. Nonspuriousness says that the association between two variables is not because of a third variable. The final two criteria are; identifying a causal mechanism- how the connection/association among variables is thought to have occurred- and the context in which this association occurs. The deterministic causal approach requires that in every study, the independent and dependent variable have an association, and within that study every case (nation, region) the independent variable has an effect on the dependent variable. John Stuart Mill devised five methods for systematically analyzing observations and making more accurate assumptions about causality. Mill's Methods discusses; direct method of agreement, method of difference, joint method of agreement and difference, method of residues and method of concomitant variations. Mill's methods are typically the most useful when the causal relationship is already suspected and can therefore be a tool for eliminating other explanations. Some methodologists contend Mill's methods cannot provide proof that the variation in one variable was caused by the variation of another variable.  Difficulties  There are several difficulties that historical comparative research faces. James Mahoney, one of the current leading figures in historical comparative research, identifies several of these in his book \\"Comparative Historical Analysis in the Social Sciences.\\" Mahoney highlights key issues such as how micro level studies can be incorporated into the macro level field of historical comparative research, issues ripe for historical comparative research that continue to remain overlooked, such as law, and the issue of whether historical comparative research should be approached as a science or approached as a history. This is one of the more prevalent debates today, often debated between Theda Skocpol, who sides with the historical approach, and Kiser and Hechter, who are proponents of the scientific view that should search for general causal principles. Both Kiser and Hechter employ models within Rational Choice Theory for their general causal principles. Historical researchers that oppose them (Skocpol, Summers, others) argue that Kiser and Hechter do not suggest many other plausible general theories, and thus it seems as though their advocacy for general theories is actually advocacy for their preferred general theory. They also raise other criticisms of using rational choice theory in historical comparative research. Role of general theory In recent decades historical comparative researchers have debated the proper role of general theory. Two of the main players in this debate have been Edgar Kiser and Michael Hechter. They have argued that it is important to use a general theory in order to be able to test the results of the research that has been conducted. They do not argue that one specific theory is better than the other just that a theory needs to be used. Their chosen theory is rational choice. One of the main problems is that everyone has a different concept of what a theory is and what makes something a theory. Some of their opponents feel that any theory can be tested and they are arguing that some cannot be. Kiser and Hecter do acknowledge that this is a growing field and that their perspective may change in the future. The comparative-historical method can be seen in The Familial State: Ruling Families and Merchant Capitalism in Early Modern Europe. Researcher Julia Adams draws on both original archival work and secondary sources to analyze how merchant families contested with noble families for influence in the early modern Dutch Republic. She argues that those contests produced the political institutions that became the modern Dutch state, by frequently making reference to England and France. Her use of feminist theory to account for elements of the Dutch Republic, such as patriarchal kinship structures in the ruling families, expanded on earlier theories of how modern states came to be. This is an illustration of how comparative-historical analysis uses cases and theories together.

Snackenherg; and commissioned 10 November 1954, Lt. Clayton L. Robertson in command.  WestPac operations  After shakedown, Reaper sailed for the western Pacific Ocean 1 May 1956. Departing Sasebo, Japan, she participated in training exercises at Taiwan with the Republic of China, and helped to search for a P4M aircraft shot down by Communist China. Arriving at Long Beach, California, 15 November, she trained off California in 1957 and early 1958. Deployed to the western Pacific 3 November 1958, she visited Sasebo, Japan; Kaohsiung, Taiwan; Chinhae, Korea; Sattahip, Thailand; Subic Bay, Philippines; and Buckner Bay, Okinawa, before arriving at Long Beach 31 May 1959.  Joint exercises with various nations  During an amphibious exercise in November 1959, she operated out of Kodiak, Alaska, with Canadian minesweepers. After training in 1960, she deployed to the western Pacific 4 January 1961, and participated in separate exercises with the Philippine Navy, and the Nationalist Chinese Navy, before arriving via Japan at Long Beach 17 July. Departing Long Beach 16 November 1962 for western Pacific deployment, she joined exercise in the Philippines and Taiwan, including a SEATO exercise off Manila Bay, Luzon, before returning to Long Beach 22 June 1963.  Supporting Vietnam operations  After exercises off California, she remained active with the U.S. Pacific Fleet in 1964 and 1965. Sailing for the western Pacific 21 September 1966, she participated in \\"Operation Market Time\\" patrol duty off Vietnam during November and December, and in February and March 1967, before reaching Long Beach 27 July. Deployed to the western Pacific again in April 1968, she patrolled off Vietnam and visited Chinhae, Korea; and Sattahip, Thailand, arriving Long Beach 3 December. Reaper deployed for the final time to the Western Pacific in the fall of 1969; Lt Cmdr Robert Kahler commanding. In early 1970, she came under mortar fire when anchored near Vung Tau, Vietnam. In February, Reaper provided covering fire for her boarding team sent to check out a grounded and abandoned small coastal freighter. The boarding team had come under heavy fire from opposing forces ashore. This deployment also saw the untimely death, as the result of a non-combat ship-board accident, of SF2 Lester Riley, Jr. Reaper remained active with the U.S. Seventh Fleet until 2 May 1970 when she returned to the U.S. West Coast.  Training ship assignment  Upon her return, she was assigned duty as a U.S. Naval Reserve training ship and remained so engaged until being decommissioned 22 September 1972.  Decommissioning  After decommissioning she was transferred to the Ships Inactivation and Maintenance Facility at Vallejo, California.

It was directed by Michael Lindsay-Hogg (who also directed the 1970 Beatles film, Let It Be) and starred Jared Harris as John Lennon and Aidan Quinn as Paul McCartney. Beatles historian Martin Lewis served as the film's technical adviser, and the screenplay was written by \\"longtime Beatles fan and Beatlefest attendee, Mark Stanfield.\\"TWO OF US - A VH1 ORIGINAL MOVIE The title of the film comes from the 1970 Beatles song \\"Two of Us\\". Historical background There was great public demand for a Beatles reunion during the 1970s. For example, in September 1976, American promoter Sid Bernstein, who had booked many of the Beatles' historic American appearances in 1964-1966, published a full-page ad in the New York Times publicly requesting the group to reunite and offering millions of dollars.The oldies.about.com Interview: Sid Bernstein On April 24, 1976, Saturday Night Live producer Lorne Michaels parodied such offers with an on-air announcement that he would pay the Beatles $3,000 if they would perform on his program together. He joked, \\"divide [the money] up any way you want. If you want to give less to Ringo, that's up to you.\\" John Lennon discussed the Saturday Night Live episode, as well as his relationship with McCartney, in a September 1980 interview for Playboy: Paul McCartney also remembered the event for an interview: \\"[John] said, 'We should go down there. We should go down now and just do it.' It was one of those moments where we said, 'Let's not and say we did.' \\"VH1 The Beatles: And in the End... Overview Two of Us opens with the following introduction: The screenplay consists of a series of long conversations between John Lennon and Paul McCartney (while their wives, as well as other Beatles, are referred to, they do not appear in the production). The discussions between Lennon and McCartney explore a number of issues including the breakup of the Beatles and the difficulties that developed between them after Lennon married Yoko Ono. According to Lindsay-Hogg, \\"most of the film [consists of] two men and four walls . . . you can't get more intimate than that.\\"A Day in the Life (That Might Have Been)\\" Newsday Critic Kevin McDonough argues that, \\"in less talented hands, Two of Us, like any Beatles-reenactment movie, could have been an awful exercise in bad wigs and Liverpool accents. Instead, Lindsay-Hogg and first-time screen writer Mark Stanfield have created a small masterpiece, a variation on My Dinner With Andre meets The Beatles.\\" Structure and characters Critic David Bianculli likened Two of Us to a three-act play with the following structure: :Act I: \\"McCartney, on the New York leg of his world tour with his post-Beatles group Wings, arrives unannounced at Lennon's Dakota apartment at a time when Yoko is away; they exchange small talk and biting insults, consume some marijuana and eventually end up noodling around on the piano.\\"LENNON-MCCARTNEY TELEPIC ROCK SOLID :Act II: \\"[McCartney and Lennon] don disguises, walk through Central Park and confront a few of their fans at a quiet little restaurant.\\" :Act III: \\"As the evening wears down, they watch Saturday Night Live together and, by chance, witness producer Lorne Michaels offering the Beatles a laughably low sum ‚Äì $3,000 ‚Äì to reunite on his show. Impulsively, they toy with the idea of speeding to Rockefeller Center to perform a few songs that very night.\\" Nanciann Cherry wrote that, \\"[Harris and Quinn] are superb, capturing accents, mannerisms, and behavior of their two famous characters. More than a fine job of imitation, Harris and Quinn get beyond the trappings of fame and show us two men, former best friends, who have gone separate ways and no longer know how to recapture that friendship.\\"\\"Two of Us is a Grand Fantasy: VH1 Film Explores The Realm of What Have Been.\\" The Blade Critic Ed Bumgardner wrote that: :This conjured-up day- in-the-life meeting between Sir Paul and Saint John, a pretentious project ripe for disaster, is actually a thoughtful, well-developed character study that shouldn't embarrass either actor or the two men they so beautifully portray [...] Lindsay-Hogg's sharp eye for detail lends credence to the storyline. The period clothes and haircuts ring true, as do the dead-on scouse accents sported by Quinn and Harris as McCartney and Lennon.\\"Imagine: Lennon, McCartney Are Subjects of a What If Film.\\" Winston-Salem Journal Production Jim DeRogatis interviewed Lindsay-Hogg about his involvement with the film. Lindsay-Hogg stated that he became involved with the project because the screenplay, :wasn't so much about The Beatles. It was a very good script in which the agency of these two famous people and their story takes you somewhere deeper. To me, that's the nature of friendship: How we grow, how we grow up, and how things change. These boys knew each other when they were 16 and now they're 35 and they have to find a new truth. We all have our own relationships like that, whether they're matrimonial relationships or friendships. Of the screenplay he further stated, \\"Mark Stanfield is a good writer and a Beatles fan who has a lot of knowledge [...] Some of that stuff was ad-libbed by the actors because they really got into this, but Mark also wrote characters instead of stereotypes or caricatures.\\" In another interview, Stanfield discussed the decision to create a fictionalized account of actual people: \\"I didn't give it a lot of thought. Certainly it's been done before, from Shakespeare through something like Melvin and Howard. And, more recently, in films like Gods and Monsters. Shakespeare in Love, for that matter.\\"An interview with Mark Stanfield The film's technical advisor (and Beatles historian), Martin Lewis, conducted extensive research, drawing upon both his, as well as Michael Lindsay-Hogg's personal knowledge of The Beatles: :I spent a lot of time working on the project. I dug up hours of film, video, TV and radio material of John and Paul - so that Aidan and Jared could immerse themselves in the characters they were portraying. Much of the material was rare. What I especially wanted to give them were tapes of John and Paul talking when they were not \\"on\\" - but being themselves - as they obviously would be when the two of them were together without others around. We also spent hours discussing their characters and the dynamic of their relationship [...] Aidan and Jared were incredibly hard-working. They took their work very seriously. Neither of them planned to be IMPERSONATING their characters. They wanted to capture the ESSENCE of them more than anything.Et Tu Beatlus? Paul McCartney To further prepare for the role of Paul McCartney, Aidan Quinn traveled to Liverpool with actor Ian Hart (who'd portrayed John Lennon in the 1994 film Backbeat). While there, he visited a number of places including McCartney's childhood home.Aidan Quinn Tours Liverpool Quinn discussed McCartney's reaction to the film in an April 18, 2004 interview: \\"Just after I finished the film, I went on holiday and Paul McCartney was staying at the same place. I met him and we became quite friendly. Later, he saw the film and fortunately he liked it. It would have been terrible if he'd hated it.\\" Soundtrack The original soundtrack by David Schwartz does not include any songs by the Beatles because \\"the producers could not get clearance from the notoriously difficult copyright holders, a company owned by Michael Jackson.\\" Critic Jim DeRogatis notes that, \\"the movie was over before it struck me that the soundtrack was devoid of any Beatles songs [...] Such is our saturation in all things Beatles-related that their actual music isn't even missed in the movie. And maybe that should tell us something about getting back to what really matters in this group's legacy.\\" Critic Kevin Thompson further argues:\\"Two of Us: A Poignant Tale of Two Beatles\\" The Palm Beach Post References External links  *VH1 Official Site *The Making of Two of Us * * Category:2000 drama films Category:2000 television films Category:2000 films Category:American television films Category:American films Category:Cultural depictions of John Lennon Category:English-language films Category:Films about John Lennon Category:Films about the Beatles Category:Films directed by Michael Lindsay-Hogg Category:Films set in 1976 Category:The Beatles and television Category:VH1 films ","title":"Two of Us (2000 film)"},{"id":"13433921","text":"thumb Georges Bertin Scott (10 June 1873 - 14 January 1943) was a French war correspondent and illustrator for the French magazine L'Illustration during the early 20th century.

The facility was founded as the Dr. Charles Alderson Janeway Child Health Centre in 1966 using the former base hospital on the recently closed Pepperrell Air Force Base in the east end of the city. It was named after Charles Alderson Janeway, a pediatrician who is credited with helping to establish the hospital. The name of the facility was modified to its present form in 2001 when a new state-of-the-art facility was opened as an annex of the Health Sciences Centre. Demolition of the old facility located in the former Pepperrel AFB started in September 2008 by Kelloway Construction, hired by the provincial government at a cost of $924,129.

It falls in Adampur block of the district. The village has 794 hectares (1962 acres) of land. The population of Padhiana was 2885 at the 1991 census. Geography Padhiana is located in the fertile plains of Doaba, Punjab. It is bordered by Bist Doab canal on West, Khanaura village on South, and a brook (Choe) on North. Jalandhar, Hoshiarpur and Phagwara cities are all within 30 km of the village. History Padhiana is a remaining legacy of Minhas Confederation of villages. Minhas Rajputs of this village are descendants of Shri Baba Kati Deo Ji (alias Kati Ji), a feudal lord of the 16th century, who was a vassal to the Jaswal Raja (King) of Jaswan. Shri Kati Deo was the younger brother of legendary, Shri Mati Deo. The founding ancestor of this village migrated from Daroli, today Daroli Kalan, when family fortunes split. The village today has seven Pattis (family branches). Detailed record of each Minhas family is maintained by genealogists in Hardwar, Uttarakhand. In 1815, the village became a part of Sikh empire when territories of the Raja of Jaswan were confiscated by Ranjit Singh. Few decades later, following the second Anglo-Sikh war, it was transferred to British along with other territories of Punjab. Historical personalities of this village include Sikh warriors, Sangat Singh Ji, Uday Singh Ji, and Bachiter Singh Ji; all served in the tenth Sikh Guru, Gobind Singh Ji's army. Later, Sikh Chiefs from this village served in the army of famous Sikh leader Banda Bahadur Singh Ji, who offered them a Fief (Jagir) which lies in what is today the Patiala district of Punjab. These Chiefs later built a fort and established Bahadurgarh village in their new land. A medieval well in Padhiana, although now sealed, still exists commemorating these Chiefs, and is called Bahadargarhian Da Khoo (the well of Bahadargarh Chiefs). Prominent personalities from recent centuries include Col. Dilbagh Singh Minhas, the first Recruiting Officer at Jalandhar Cantt. The first Commander-in-Chief of the country, General K.M.

It encompasses Lake Rotomahana, the site of the Pink and White Terraces, as well as the location of the Waimangu Geyser, which was active from 1900 to 1904. The area has been increasingly accessible as a tourist attraction and contains Frying Pan Lake, which is the largest hot spring in the world, and the steaming and usually pale blue Inferno Crater Lake, the largest geyser-like feature in the world although the geyser itself cannot be seen since it plays at the bottom of the lake. Waimangu is a MƒÅori-language word meaning \\"black water\\". This name comes from the water that was thrown up by the Waimangu Geyser, which was black with mud and rocks. From the 1890s onwards, the valley has gradually been re-populated naturally by plants ranging from hot water-loving algae and bacteria to mosses and many species of native ferns, shrubs and trees. These in turn support native birdlife including kereru, tui, fantail, bellbird, and pukeko, as well as introduced bird species such as mynah, magpie, shining cuckoo, finch and sparrow. A population of black swan thrives in the lower parts of the valley and on Lake Rotomahana. According to local guides, these have been introduced to the region from Western Australia by George Edward Grey in the 19th century along with wallaby. As a rare eco-system completely naturally re-established following a volcanic eruption, Waimangu is protected as a Scenic Reserve, administered by the Department of Conservation NZ. The developing local native forest is the only current New Zealand instance of vegetation re-establishing from complete devastation without any human influence such as planting.Waimangu Wanderer Guide, October 2013 Many of Waimangu's geothermal features are ranked as Category A ‚Äì extremely important, of international significance. History The largest volcanic eruption in the past 700 years in New Zealand, the 1886 Mount Tarawera eruption, created the geo-thermal area of the Waimangu Volcanic Rift Valley. The valley lies at the south-western end of the rift created in this one-day eruption. All vegetation in the Waimangu Valley was completely destroyed by the eruption and the area was covered in mud and volcanic ash on average thick. Over the decade following the Mount Tarawera eruption, hydrothermal surface activity and geothermal features permanently established themselves in the Waimangu Valley, even though no such activity had been reported there before 1886. Plant life slowly re-established itself around the turn of the century as the new soil began to settle and stabilise. The first significant hydrothermal feature of the area was the Waimangu Geyser, active from 1900 to 1904. Over the course of the first two decades of the 20th century, several events shaped the area around Echo Crater and Inferno Crater. Eruptions in 1915 and 1917 enlarged Echo Crater. The craters formed by the latter eruption filled up to become Frying Pan Lake by mid 1918. Further smaller eruptions continued throughout the 20th century, with the most recent one in May 1981 in the Raupo Pond Crater destroying the Mud Rift created there in 1906. Frying Pan Lake overflow stream Geothermal and Hydrothermal Features The stretch of the Waimangu Volcanic Rift Valley running from Southern Crater to the shores of Lake Rotomahana has been a hotspot of geothermal and hydrothermal activity since the 1886 Mount Tarawera eruption, and contains the three lake-filled craters Southern Crater, Echo Crater, and Inferno Crater, as well as the bush-clad Raupo Pond Crater, Fairy Crater and Black Crater. The Southern Crater was formed by the 1886 Mount Tarawera eruption and has not been notably active since. Its floor is filled by the shallow Emerald Pool, a cold water lake of mostly rainwater. The lake's water is usually a brown colour, but can vary depending on the state of the plants growing in it. Red aquatic fern growth is sometimes present. A short distance northeast lies Echo Crater, the biggest crater of the area, filled with the steaming-hot Frying Pan Lake, which is the largest hot spring in the world. The lake has an average depth of and covers . The average temperature of its acidic (pH 3.5) water is and the lake's overflow is the source of Waimangu StreamLINZ Topo50 Map BF37 (Hot Water Creek)Waimangu Wanderer Guide, April 2014 flowing through the valley and into Lake Rotomahana. Colourful sinter terraces are visible on the western shore of Frying Pan Lake, and immediately east of Echo Crater was the site of the extinct Waimangu Geyser. The crater area continued to be the source of eruptions in 1915, 1917, and last in 1973, and is still highly active, as evident by the steaming Cathedral Rocks to the north, and a cluster of hot springs and silica formations northeast of the lake referred to as \\"Hot Springs of Mother Earth (Nga Puia o te Papa)\\". Bird's Nest Spring The margins of Waimangu Stream from Frying Pan Lake to east of Inferno Crater are covered with delicate silica formations and colourful mineral deposits containing traces of arsenic, molybdenum, antimony, and tungsten, while the stream bed is home to blue-green algae and filamentous colonies of the photosynthetic bacterium Chloroflexus aurantiacus in a range of colours from bright green to orange. In the midst of this area is the picturesque Bird's Nest Terrace, a delicate silica terrace with the small volcano-shaped Bird's Nest Spring atop continuously erupting near boiling-hot water about high. The terrace is covered in blue-green algae, which cannot survive in the hot stream of water running down from the spring, providing a colourful contrast of green and orange. Further along, Waimangu Stream flows past the aptly named Clamshell Spring, a hot spring of boiling silica-rich water, and then continues through a deep natural trench with walls of silica stalactite formations formed by the dripping of trickles of mineral-rich water. North of this area, on the slope of Mt Haszard, is Inferno Crater, filled with a striking pale blue lake of highly acidic water with a pH as low as 2.2. The crater was blasted into the side of the mountain as part of the 1886 Mount Tarawera eruption event and remains the site of the largest geyser-like feature in the world. Although the actual geyser plays at the bottom of the lake and cannot be seen, a handful of active fumaroles are visible on the shore and the cliff face behind the lake. The water level of this up-to- lake follows a complicated rhythmic cycle that is interconnected with the nearby Frying Pan Lake. Mt. Haszard was named after school teacher Charles Haszard and members of his family who were killed during the Mount Tarawera eruption. The locally prominent small mountain contains the shallow Raupo Pond Crater, the , steep-sided Fairy Crater, and Black Crater. All of these craters were formed during the Mount Tarawera eruption and have subsequently been completely covered in native bush. Waimangu Stream continues east past Mt Haszard and past a prominent kaolin clay slope featuring hot springs, to merge with the cold water Haumi Stream, which cools the combined water flow considerably. Blue pool at Warbrick Terrace Further geothermal features along the lower part of the valley include the Marble Terrace, featuring an expansive sinter flat and buttresses composed of similar material to the Pink and White Terraces, and the multi-coloured Warbrick Terrace. The white and orange silica deposits of the Marble Terrace are fed by the hot spring in Iodine Pool, with small waves of water overflowing the pool at around temperature and washing over the terrace. Iodine Pool is named after the brown colouring of the rocks and bank around it. Warbrick Terrace at the end of the Rift Valley is named after members of the Warbrick family, who were involved in guiding tours in the area in the two decades following the 1886 Mount Tarawera eruption. The terrace is a set of fast-growing orange and white silica platforms similar to Marble Terrace. From the 1930s to the 1950s, a small geyser played on the terrace. The area in this open-sided crater features several small clearly visible hot springs and a prominent aggregation of layers forming a dam around a pale blue pool of silica-rich water. The dam started growing in the 1990s by sinter deposition that is assisted by the growth of algae and encloses an ever-deepening pond of water behind it.Information panel at Warbrick Terraces The pond drains from time to time, revealing the delicate silica formations and edges. Fauna and Flora Waimangu is home to a wide range of micro-organisms and plants adapted to the different thermal conditions in the valley, from thermophilic bacteria surviving temperatures of and algae growing in acidity levels of pH 3.8 to mosses and prostrate kanuka growing in soil temperatures up to . All vegetation in the valley originates from no earlier than the 1890s, when plants started re-populating the area in a natural succession following the complete destruction of any plant life by the 1886 Mount Tarawera eruption. Over the past 120 years, plant life in the Waimangu Valley has re-established itself via dispersion of spores and seeds by wind and birds; no plantings by humans were done. Subsequent small eruptions still caused local disturbance of the flora, notably the 1917 Echo Crater eruption destroying much of the flora between the crater and the visitor centre. Blue-green algae growing on the sinter floor of Waimangu Stream The valley's botanically-rich ecosystem now includes close to 50 different tree and shrub species, around 50 ferns and allied plants and many herbaceous plants and grasses. Notable species include kanuka adapting a prostrate habit on account of the warm soil temperatures, arching clubmoss capable of growing in soil temperatures of over , and large populations of threatened fern species. Some of the plants are frost- intolerant and are restricted to hydrothermal areas in New Zealand. Different species of bacteria, such as Chloroflexus, co-exist with blue-green algae in the beds of hot water streams in the valley, in particular the overflow stream from Frying Pan Lake. The algae and bacteria form carpets of vivid hues ranging from orange to bright green and blue depending on water temperature and sulphur concentration. The margins of these streams are often populated by mosses and ferns. Several non-native plant species have also re-spread into the valley, as have possums, rats and mice. A pest control scheme was introduced in 2000, and efforts are underway to ensure Patiti Island in Lake Rotomahana is kept pest-free. Tourism The first significant tourism in the Waimangu Valley area started with the eruptions of the Waimangu Geyser in 1900. Day trip visitors from Rotorua were keen to see the geyser erupting reportedly up to high until its cessation in late 1904. A tourist trip called the \\"Round Trip\\" ran from the summer of 1902/1903. In 1903, four people were killed by a sudden eruption of the Waimangu Geyser. Despite the dangers, the area remained a popular tourist attraction. The 1917 Echo Crater eruption destroyed a nearby accommodation building and killed two people. This event was the last major event in the valley and changed the landscape by causing Frying Pan Lake to form by mid 1918. The ruins of the accommodation building were pulled down in 1970. Waimangu's intense hydrothermal activity and diverse features make it an area of international interest for geologists, volcanologists, but also botanists with an interest in the uniquely adapted thermotolerant plants inhabiting zones across a great range of soil acidity levels and temperatures. Scientific monitoring equipment was installed at several sites in the Waimangu Valley in 1970, in particular to investigate the unusual interlinked cyclic variation between Frying Pan Lake and Crater Lake. Since 1990, tourism in the Department of Conservation-administered Scenic Reserve has been operated by Waimangu Volcanic Valley Ltd under a lease and has won several tourism and environmental awards. The operation includes a courtesy shuttle bus service running along the private gravel road through the valley between the visitor centre and Lake Rotomahana, and a boat cruise on Lake Rotomahana. The bus services three bus stops where the gravel road intersects with the walking track through the valley. It provides a schedule of nine return trips per day ‚Äì unlimited access to it is included in the entry fee. The boat cruise runs 5‚Äì6 scheduled trips daily and is an additional price. Amenities provided in the valley include a visitor centre, opened in 2000, a cafe and gift shop, and additional toilets near the Warbrick Terrace. The visitor centre and car park are located along Waimangu Road, from State Highway 5, fifteen minutes drive south of Rotorua. The main walk through the Waimangu Volcanic Rift Valley comprises of easy-walking wide gravel paths and boardwalks and is accessible via wheelchairs, except for Inferno Crater and the Mt Haszard Hiking Trail. The walk starts at the visitor centre and tends downhill past the Southern Crater, Echo Crate and Frying Pan Lake, past a number of geothermal features, the Marble Terrace and Warbrick Terrace, and finishes at Lake Rotomahana. A short detour of 50 steps leads up to a viewing platform next to Inferno Crater Lake. Due to the attractions along the way, the suggested walking time is 1.5 to 2 hours. The courtesy shuttle bus can be used to return to the visitor centre from any of the three bus stops, or to shortcut between them. While self-guided walking is the most popular option to explore the geothermal features along the walk, fully guided tours are also available. The 45 minute boat cruise takes in thermal activity along the shores of Lake Rotomahana that can only be seen from the water. The additional Mt Haszard Hiking Trail was opened in 2005 and although steeper, is of walking track standard. The track follows parts of the early 1900s Waimangu \\"Round Trip\\" walking route and continues to climb up from Inferno Crater, skirting Raupo Pond Crater, Fairy Crater and Black Crater, with several good vantage points providing panoramic views over the valley. It adds 20 minutes walking time, but does not pass any notably active geothermal features. It is recommended to visit the geothermal features between Bird's Nest Terrace and the confluence of Haumi Stream and Hot Water Creek beforehand or back-track once the hiking trail re-joins the main path, to not miss out on them. In August 2013, the Te Ara Ahi bicycle trail was completed. It encompasses Waimangu and makes it possible to ride on a dedicated bicycle path all the way from Rotorua to the Waimangu Volcanic Valley. The Rotorua-Waimangu section is a 3‚Äì4 hour easy-intermediate ride via a concrete bike path and then Waimangu Road.

The word was first used as a term of feudal law, of the overlord, the lord paramount, who held his fief from no superior lord, and was thus opposed to a mesne lord, one who held fief from a superior.\\"Paramount is a word used in our law, signifying the highest lord of the fee, of lands, tenements or hereditaments\\" in The Common Law Common-Placed, by Giles Jacob 1726. p.351 Those who held their fiefs from one who was not a lord paramount were given the correlative term \\"paravail\\", (from par aval, meaning 'in the valley'). The word was confused by English lawyers with \\"avail,\\" help, assistance, profit, and applied to the actual working tenant of the land, the lowest tenant or occupier. A well-documented example of paramountcy is the Lordship of Bowland. In 1311, it was subsumed as part of the Honour of Clitheroe into the Earldom of Lancaster. After 1351, it was administered as part of the Duchy of Lancaster, with the Duke of Lancaster (from 1399, the sovereign) acknowledged as lord paramount over the Forest of Bowland and the ten manors of the Liberty of Bowland. As lord paramount, he was styled Lord King of Bowland.Cambridge History of the Lordship of Bowland The Marquess of Exeter is the hereditary Lord Paramount of Peterborough. The term lord paramount has been invoked in other common law jurisdictions, including New York (1852).De Peyster v. Michael, 6,NY 467; quoted in 28 Am.

It is widespread across Europe and has recently been found in North America. This species is believed to have originated relatively recently. Classification Phytophythora alni was discovered in 1993 in Southern Britain. It has subsequently been reported in many European countries including the Netherlands, Germany, France, Sweden, Belgium, Austria and Hungary and has recently been found in Alaska. P. alni consists of three subspecies, the most commonly isolated and most virulent subspecies P. alni alni (also referred to as the 'standard form') and two less commonly isolated subspecies P. alni uniformis (also called the Swedish variant) and P. alni multiformis (which contains the Dutch, German and UK variants). A recent genetic analysis has suggested that P. alni alni. was generated on many separate occasions by the hybridization of either P. alni uniformis with P. alni multiformis or their ancestors. The same analysis suggests that P. alni uniformis may have P. cambivora as an ancestor. P. alni multiformis may have been generated by autopolyploidization (the spontaneous duplication of chromosome number within a species) or by a hybridisation of two unknown species a long time ago in evolutionary terms (ancient reticulation). Reproduction Members of the genus Phytophthora may reproduce by both sexual and asexual methods. P. alni is homothallic meaning that both structures for sexual reproduction (antheridia and oogonia) appear in a single culture. The antheridia are amphigynous, except in some cultures of P. alni. multiformis where paragynous antheridia may occur. Unlike most species of Phytophthora, which are diploid, P. alni alni is near tetraploid and unable to complete meiosis beyond metaphase I. In culture, many oogonia prematurely abort or appear abnormal and only one third of the oospores that appear normal are reported to be viable. As a result, it is believed to spread predominantly via asexual means, namely zoospores which are produced in a specialised structure known as the sporangium. Water temperature has been shown to affect sporulation, with warmer water increasing sporangia production. Temperatures of 8 ¬∞C and below prevent production of sporangia. Infection Affected alder species include: * Alnus cordata - Italian alder * Alnus glutinosa - Common alder (most susceptible) * Alnus incana - Grey alder (most resistant) * Alnus viridis - Green alder The only trees described as affected in the wild are alder trees; however, greenhouse inoculation trials have suggested that walnut (Juglans regia), chestnut (Castanea sativa) and wild cherry (Prunus avium) trees may also be susceptible. Risk factors for infection include: water temperature (disease risk is higher in warmer waters), soil type (disease risk is higher in fine textured soil, especially clay loams) and water course type (disease risk is higher in slow flowing water courses). Infected trees have abnormally small, yellow and sparse leaves which frequently fall prematurely. The crowns of trees which have been infected for many years have many dead twigs and branches. Tarry or rusty spots may appear at the base of the trunk which are indicative of the death of the phloem caused by the P. alni invasion. The course of the disease is varied, with many trees dying rapidly once symptoms appear, however, others may deteriorate slowly over many years. P.alni is regarded as a serious threat to riparian woodland. In 2007 Oregon listed P.alni as one of its \\"100 most dangerous invasive species to keep out\\".

In August 2004, over 320,000 people visited the zoo, the second highest number of visitors among all the zoos in Japan. Located in Higashi Asahikawa, on the outskirts of Asahikawa, the Asahiyama Zoo is accredited by the Japanese Association of Zoos and Aquariums (JAZA). AnimalsHistory JR Hokkaido's Asahiyama Zoo Train from the Sapporo area. The Maruyama Zoo in Sapporo, and the Obihiro Zoo predate the construction of the Asahiyama Zoo. In 1964, the mayor at the time, K≈çz≈ç Igarashi, budgeted for the Asahiyama Zoo project, and chose Mount Asahi as the building site due to its geology and traffic convenience. Construction of the Asahiyama Zoo began in April 1966, and was completed in June 1967, at a total expense of 250 million yen. The zoo was inaugurated on July 1, 1967, with 75 species of animals including 200 common carp. Driven by a decline in visitors, the park erected a steel roller coaster which was dismantled in 2006. As the population of Asahikawa has increased, the number of visitors rose to a peak of 597,000 in 1983. In 1994, when a western lowland gorilla and a ring-tailed lemur in the zoo died of an echinococcus infection, the zoo was closed before the regular season to prevent the disease from spreading. This resulted in a decline in the number of visitors. Since 1997, the zoo has undertaken the construction of unique interactive animal viewing facilities, initiated by chief manager Masao Kosuge. After \\"Totori no Mura\\" (Totori's Village), which enables visitors to see birds flying freely in a huge cage, the zoo continued to install new facilities including Polar Bear Aquatic Park, a \\"walk- through\\" penguin aquarium, an orangutan trapeze, and a seal aquarium which includes a vertical tube through which the seals can swim. In August 2004, the monthly number of visitors exceeded 320,000, which surpassed Ueno Zoo in Tokyo. In 2006, the annual number of visitors reached 2 million, and the following year, the number was 3 million, which was surpassed only by the Ueno Zoo (about 3.5 million people in the same year). Over the years, the Asahiyama Zoo has drawn a number of media attractions, and some TV programs and publications featuring the zoo's success have also been created.

It operates under the Main Roads Act 1930 (WA). The Department manages more than of roads, representing the arterial road network in Western Australia. Each of the roads must be declared a \\"public highway\\" or \\"main road\\" in the Government Gazette and is allocated a state route number ‚Äì many roads perceived as main roads by the public are in fact managed by local councils. Main Roads Western Australia also regulates heavy vehicles through the issue of permits and notices under the authority granted to the Commissioner of Main Roads under the Road Traffic Act 1974. The Road Transport Compliance Section, a section within the Department, employs Transport Inspectors who, alongside police officers, monitor heavy vehicle movement and enforce the Road Traffic Act 1974. History=Establishment The first roads in Western Australia were built during the settlement of the Swan River Colony in the late 1820s. Prior to this, narrow bush tracks had been used by the local Aboriginal people. In 1871, local governments were established, often called Road Boards in rural areas. Their primary function was to create and maintain the roads network in their local areas. Most of these rural roads, especially in the Wheatbelt, connected farms to the state government's extensive rail network, usually covering a distance of less than . By the end of World War I, technology such as the internal combustion engine had advanced considerably. Following the war, there was a tenfold increase in the number of motor vehicles in Western Australia, from 2,538 in 1918 to 25,270 in 1927. Motor transport was very efficient compared to horse-drawn vehicles, and also more efficient than railways for short distances. In 1923, recognising the importance of road transportation, the Commonwealth government began granting a combined total of ¬£500,000 per year to the state governments for road improvement works. In 1926, the funding level was increased, with Western Australia allocated ¬£672,000. The Roads and Bridges Branch of the State Government's Public Works Department would not be able to spend such a large amount of money, so a Main Roads Board was established in July 1926. The board worked in cooperation with local governments, taking over the development of significant roads, and providing assistance for others. District offices were set up in regional areas to better coordinate work undertaken there, and liaise with those local governments. Early 20th century The Great Depression, which started in 1929, brought chaos into the new system. The Board was dissolved, and replaced by a Commissioner of Main Roads, the first of which was Edward Tindale. All the district offices were closed down, with the workers laid off. The number of staff in Perth was reduced from 107 to 41, and salaries were also lowered. During the 1930s, Main Roads was able to provide work for the unemployed, as road construction at that time required many labourers. Large groups of men spent one or two weeks in camps, constructing roads. With the outbreak of World War II in 1939, a smaller labour force undertook works for Main Roads, which were primarily for military purposes, such as aerodromes and parade grounds. The late 1940s were a boom-time for Main Roads. Government funding and support increased, and new equipment such as power graders, front-end loaders, and large trucks allowed work to be undertaken more efficiently. The amount of work meant there was a high demand for workers ‚Äì the re-established regional divisions became employment hubs for European migrants.

If the first track sounds slightly like \\"Eleanor Rigby\\", this is because Bram Taylor plays cello on both of them. Two other guests are Mike Heron and Robin Williamson from The Incredible String Band. The relationship bore fruit on Shirley's next album.

On this song, Shirley accompanies herself on 5-string dulcimer, adapted to have a banjo neck, an instrument she only ever used on this album. Three of the songs on this collection had previously been recorded on False True Lovers (1960) - \\"Just as the Tide Was Flowing\\", \\"Richie Story\\" and \\"The Unquiet Grave\\". Dolly Collins puts her stamp on \\"Richie Story\\" in her pipe organ accompaniment, a stately march as the couple in the song progress through the street to church to marry. In 1964, Shirley had recorded Folk Roots, New Routes, which introduced eastern rhythms to English folk song.

For the majority of its life the station operated as a communications station. In its latter years it had a logistics and supply role. The station closed in 2013 and declared surplus to military requirements by the Ministry of Defence. The site was sold to property developers and all station buildings were demolished so it could be redeveloped for residential use. History= RAF Leighton Buzzard  RAF Leighton Buzzard was created to be the main Central Exchange and Wireless Telegraph station for the RAF's telephone and telegraph network, which had been established from 1936. The site was chosen for its good wireless reception, proximity to the existing GPO trunk telephone network, and lack of other apparent military significance. It became operational in May 1939, with a staff of about 600 servicemen and women. Second World War During the Second World War the station was a major base for secret communication traffic. A large number of tunnels filled with what was state-of-the art equipment were used to protect the equipment. It handled \\"practically the whole of the national landline teleprinter communications and a large part of the private speech telephone system\\", together with the wireless transmission and reception of all RAF international communications.Gregory (2011), pp 3, 27; citing TNA: PRO AIR 28/457 and TNA: PRO AIR 2/7306 It has been described as in 1942 \\"the largest telephone exchange in the world\\".Unveiled: The secret base at the heart of MI5, Leighton Buzzard Observer, 11 November 2014, discussing Brown & Herbert (2015) Cold War Renamed RAF Stanbridge after the war, the station continued to be the hub of the RAF's communication network. In 1959, as the RAF's Central Signals Centre, it was dealing with 10,000 messages a day: 5,500 domestic and 4,500 international.Gregory (2011), p 19; citing a 1959 article in Flight International. It later became designated the Communications Control Centre (CCC or Commcen Central), at the heart of the Defence Communications Network (DCN), established in 1969. During the Cold War the station was still used as a vital communications base. In the early 1970s RAF Stanbridge had satellite sites at RAF Bampton Castle (Receiver site), RAF Weyhill (Transmitter site), RAF Edlesborough (Transmitter site), RAF Greatworth (transmitter site) and RAF Stoke Hammond (Receiver site). Stanbridge was then known as the Communications Control Centre (CCC or Commcen Central) and was the hub of the Defence Communications Network (DCN). The main building hosted Systems Control, a tape relay centre (Main Hall), in which were based several banks of TASS transmit positions (Telegraph Automatic Switching System) and later a secure Telegraphic Automatic Routing Equipment (TARE). All of these methods of communication depended on paper tapes which were punched with Murray Code. A secure Comms cell which was used to communicate by morse with deployed detachments worldwide as an emergency means of communication was located next to the local traffic office. The DCN connected sites all over the world by HF radio links using the two diverse transmitter sites and the diverse receiver sites. The Distant Terminals of these links included Canberra, Gan, Cyprus, Ottawa and Malta. Other UK sites involved were the RN site at HMS Forest Moor and RAF Oakhanger with its satellite earth-station. * RAF Bampton Castle was a technical site only, equipped with HF radio receivers and an aerial farm and parented by RAF Brize Norton. * RAF Edlesborough was a technical site only, equipped with HF radio transmitters and a large aerial farm and parented by RAF Stanbridge. * RAF Stoke Hammond was a technical site only, equipped with HF radio receivers and an aerial farm and parented by RAF Stanbridge. It closed in the mid 1970s and the site was returned to the owner, leaving Bampton Castle as the only receiver site. * RAF Greatworth had its own accommodation but was administratively parented from RAF Stanbridge. Like Edlesborough it was an HF radio transmitter site with a large aerial farm. The site opened in the 1930s and finally closed in 1992. It is now an industrial park known as Greatworth Park. These sites were equipped with radio equipment made by Marconi and Racal. During the 1970s the transmitters used were the Marconi HS series (HS31, HS51 and HS71) and their more modern MST series. The power of these transmitters ranged from 1 kW up to 30 kW and the two transmitter sites operated as a RED path and a YELLOW path to provide diversity to cope with atmospheric conditions, HF radio being at the mercy of the ionosphere. Aerials were of the dipole, rhombic or biconical designs being usually fed via twin wire feeders. By the mid 1980s, with its original equipment obsolete, the station was very run down; but in 1987 the station took on a new role, with its main building substantially rebuilt, when the RAF Supply Control Centre (RAFSCC) was relocated from RAF Hendon to RAF Stanbridge, along with the Joint Services Air Trooping Centre (JSATC). In this role it housed the RAF's Supply Central Computer System, responsible for tracking logistics and supplies records for the RAF all across the world. Administratively the station was latterly grouped under RAF Henlow and then under RAF Brampton Wyton Henlow. Post Cold War RAF Stanbridge ceased to be an independent station on 31 March 1995, becoming a satellite station of RAF Henlow, located approximately to the north east. Prior to 1999, RAF Stanbridge was responsible for providing Communications Support to its now closed satellite site at RAF Edlesborough. The base was one of the smallest RAF Stations having only two Station buildings and 24 married quarters. It was part of a bigger site which was sold off by the Ministry of Defence (MoD) in 1999. The Supply Control Centre work was contracted out in 2011 to Boeing Defence UK at Milton Keynes, other functions having been outsourced in the 1990s. RAF Stanbridge was deemed redundant, and closed the following year. The station's remaining buildings were demolished in 2016.Former secret MOD base demolished by Aspect Four, Aspect Four Demolition Ltd, 2 March 2016 The site was closed in March 2013, but the formal closure ceremony happened during June 2012 with the personnel and families moving to RAF Wyton.

She is a 2014 International Latino Book Awards Finalist. Edna has six children and nine grandchildren. She lives in Quito, Ecuador in the Valley of Tumbaco with her husband and four dogs, who keep her company while she writes. She visits school children who read her books often. Biography=Impact Edna Iturralde has positioned her as one of Latin America's most skilled, prolific and versatile authors of children's and young adult literature, with 59 books over a career that spans 35 years. Her collection of short stories Green Was My Forest was selected as one of the ten best children's books written in Latin America during the 20th Century. Edna's influence has expanded beyond Ecuador. In the United States four of her books were chosen to be part of the Common Core kits in the schools in Los Angeles, California and Houston Texas. The Texas Library Association selected two of her bi-lingual books for its 2016-17 list of ten recommended bi-lingual books. Two of her books are part of the Require Summer Reading Books recommended by Scholastic Books. Three of her books have won the Skipping Stones International Book Prizehttp://www.skippingstones.org/2013BookAwards.LR.pdf and five of her books won the International Latino Book Award. In Mexico, three of her books were also chosen, in different years, by the SEP, the Mexican Secretariat of Public Education, to be part of all the school libraries in that country. Her book Verde fue mi selva (Green was my Forest), was selected as one of the ten ‚Äúessential‚Äù books in the Latin-American List of Children and Young Adults Literature of the 20th Century by a panel of 27 experts from Latin American countries that was convoked by the SM Foundation and the Directorate of Libraries, Archives and Museums of Chile. (Fundaci√≥n SM y la Direcci√≥n de Bibliotecas, Archivos y Museos de Chile (DIBAM)). These are substantial achievements for a writer who comes from a small country where opportunities to be known internationally are relatively few. Childhood and Young Adulthood Edna's early childhood years laid the foundation for her literary career. Her aviator father died in a plane crash when she was one, and she was raised as a single child. Her maternal grandfather told her stories and her mother read to her, but without siblings, her imagination developed as she amused herself by telling stories to her dolls and dogs, and day-dreaming on garden swings. In fifth grade her class was selected to present a play at the school assembly and no appropriate play could be found, so Edna went home, sat down, and wrote one. Her teacher approved, the play was given and Edna realized how much she loved writing. From then on her dream was to become a writer when she grew up. Classmates asked her to write stories for them on topics they chose; the birth of a new baby brother or sister, a trip to the mountains, the death of a beloved pet and many other themes that were important in their lives. She also wrote in the school newspaper and was part of the Oratory Club. In 1967, she became the first girl to win Ecuador's Presidential National Award for Oratory and the first girl to win the oratory prize of the Municipality of Quito. University was not an option, and she still dreamed of writing, but she needed to work. As a tour guide for Metropolitan Touring in Ecuador, her stories so amused tourists that they voted her the best tour guide in South America of IntravTravel Group. She started a boutique by renting a room in an old house, which she painted and decorated herself. It was Quito's first boutique, called Carnaby Street. She sold, often on credit, the clothes and copper and silver jewelry she designed. She married at twenty-two to Diederick van Maasdijk and became the full-time mother of four children. Early career Marriage turned out to further her literary career, because since her children insisted she repeat her bedtime stories exactly the same way every time she had to write them down. So when Panorama, a supplement of the Quito newspaper El Comercio, solicited children's‚Äô stories, she sent in one of hers. Not only did Panorama choose her story, but also asked her to provide it a story every week. After one year of writing for Panorama (1980-1981), Edna founded La Cometa (The Kite) in 1982. That same year, her husband died in a plane crash. Edna continued writing La Cometa, the first weekly children's magazine to be published in Ecuador. For the next eleven years (1982-1993), she produced La Cometa every week (with the assistance of only a secretary, an artist, and a pet squirrel), filling its 16 pages only with her own stories, serial novels, comics and games. She signed many of them with a pseudonym to make people think the magazine had a larger staff. La Cometa was distributed for free with the newspaper Diario Hoy, considerably increasing its circulation, and reached about 210,000 children weekly. Many of these children lacked money to buy books but learned the pleasure of reading from La Cometa. La Cometa provided a model for several other free South American children's magazines. In 1985 she married Bruce Kernan and had two more children. Growth as an author and communicator In 1993, commissioned by the United Nations Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF) and the Ecuadorian Ministry of Education to write about values children should learn, Iturralde wrote the 60 amusing stories in the three volumes of ‚Äò‚ÄôTo Be and To Share‚Äô‚Äô, for three different age groups. She also was a consultant of PLAN International, for which she wrote a humoristic but useful book on social relations. From 1996 to 1998, she was the representative in Ecuador of Educational Development Center (EDC). She used the Interactive Radio Instruction Method to write, produce and test 15 free distance education programs entitled ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs Play Theatre‚Äù. The program guides preschool teachers, or care givers, during 20 minutes sessions, in developing emotional intelligence and conflict resolution by appealing to the imagination of young children. Many Ecuadorian daycare centers have used it successfully. In 1996, Edna founded the Union of Writers of Literature for Children (UDELI), with the idea of helping writers of children and young adult literature to publish. The international publishing houses which were operating in Ecuador at the time only commercialized children books from Hispanic writers or translations from other languages. The association published an anthology of Christmas stories, enabling new writers and illustrators to gain exposure and giving impetus to children's literature in Ecuador. In 1998 Editorial Santillana, followed by Editorial Norma, the two most important international publishing houses in Ecuador, selected Iturralde's literature for publication. Until then, foreign titles completely dominated children and adolescent literature within Ecuador and most writers had to publish their own work. The success of Iturralde's books Verde fue mi Selva and Y su coraz√≥n escap√≥ para convertirse en p√°jaro encouraged these publishers to look into publishing more children's literature by Ecuadorian authors. Since then Edna Iturralde has continued to publish with Santillana, Norma and also with Editorial SM, and Penguin Random House, Colombia. She has published 59 books between picture books, novels, chapter books, and collections of short stories in Colombia, Mexico, Spain and the United States. From 2000 to 2002 Iturralde taught a course on Creative Writing at the Universidad San Francisco de Quito in the International Program. In early 2016 she started writing a weekly column for Family Magazine, a supplement to El Comercio newspaper. Influence on Literature in Ecuador and Beyond In 2006 Edna founded and became the first president of the Ecuadorean affiliate of the Latin-American Academy of Children and Young Adults Literature. She was its president until 2012. The literary congresses she organized in Ecuador served to draw international attention and appreciation of Ecuadorean children and young adults literature. Edna has forcefully contributed to promoting reading and raising appreciation of children and young adult literature in Ecuador. The Hoy en la Educaci√≥n Foundation named its annual literary contest after her. She only asked it give its award to new, unpublished authors of children and young adult literature, since she wanted to encourage them. She has presented and discussed her literature in hundreds of visits to schools and dozens of radio, television, newspaper and magazine interviews. Her literature has become part of the curriculum of Children's Literature studies at several Ecuadorian universities such as Universidad Tecnica Particular de Loja (UTPL) Pontificia Universidad Cat√≥lica del Ecuador (PUCE), Universidad de Cuenca Ecuador, Universidad T√©cnica de Machala, Universidad Central del Ecuador, Universidad Andina Sim√≥n Bol√≠var, Universidad Tecnol√≥gica del Equinoccial (UTE). Her books have been used as the basis for plays, ballets. The National Symphony Orchestra commissioned an orchestral piece based on one of her books, Los hijos de la Guacamaya. Her numerous awards (e.g. 2013 Woman of the Year for Literature; 2014 Manuela Saenz Libertadora del Libertador Gold Medal; 2010 Silver Rose Award for the Woman of the Year; 2007 Essential Women in Ecuador) have enormously raised the awareness in Ecuador of the beneficial role of literature for the development of children and young adults. Dr. Jaime Garc√≠a Padrino, professor of Children's and Young Adult Literature at the Universidad Complutense de Madrid, has summarized Edna's contribution to children and young adult literature: ‚Äú‚Ä¶ Iturralde‚Äôs contribution to Children‚Äôs Literature and Young Adult Literature is today one of the most outstanding in Ecuador and, by extension, in Latin America. This is due to both the number of works she has published to date and the variety of themes about which she has written. Her historical and biographical books are notable for their solid documentation and rigorous accuracy. Above all, her writing is of high expressive quality. There is no doubt that Edna Iturralde has made a significant, diverse and substantial contribution to Spanish-American Children‚Äôs and Young Adult Literature. She has drawn conspicuous attention to Ecuador, highlighting through her literature its cultural contributions to the world. Due to her keen ability to see the world through their eyes, Iturralde has successfully reached children and young adults. Her works are contributing to the creating a new generation of readers who are sensitive, tolerant and caring human beings.\\" Work 176x176px Iturralde's literature develops within a multicultural, ethnic, and social context. In an epoch when local and regional histories are being obliterated, and when few people are concerned with the special knowledge that has been preserved by certain local ethnic groups, a voice that weaves together fictional and ingenuous stories, based though they are on serious research, and through such fiction documents and projects such knowledge, is somewhat transcendental in the eyes of many. Iturralde removes the veils from the identity that is unknown or forgotten and projects it to the rest of the world. Iturralde is considered one of the most important and prolific figures of Ecuadorian children and juvenile literature. Mother of six children, she has dedicated much of her life to writing for children. Her books have been published in Colombia, Mexico, and Spain and are distributed in the United States, Peru, and Bolivia. Iturralde was the founder and director of the children's magazine La Cometa (\\"The Kite\\"), which for fifteen years was published together with the newspaper, Hoy, from Ecuador. She has published fifty eight books concerning a variety of themes, but for the last few years, she has concentrated on narratives based on ethnicity, and she is the pioneer in this genre in the children's literature of Ecuador. She has given lectures on creative writing at the University of San Francisco de Quito in the International Program. She has won various prizes and nominations within and outside her country. Among the most important of these are the Ecuador National Prize for Children's Literature Dario Guevara Mavorga in Ecuador in 2001, the Skipping Stones Award in the thumb225x225px¬°xito! United States in 2002 and 2005, and the Mention of Honor of the Municipality of Quito in 2003 and 2004. She has been nominated twice, in 2012 and 2013, to the Astrid Lindgren Memorial Award (ALMA). As Her work was selected by the SEP within the competition of the Mexican Ministry of Education in 2003 and 2005. In 2005, two of her books were nominated for the Ecuadorian Honor List of IBBY (International Board of Books for the Young). She is the president of the Ecuadorian Academy of Children and Juvenile Literature, which is associated with the Latin American Academy of Children and Juvenile Literature.

It is maintained by the Royal Air Force and used by NATO aircraft. History Range warning sign The area has been in continual use since the First World War and was established as a protection point from Zeppelins trying to enter the Humber area. Donna Nook is just north of North Somercotes and is also a nature reserve with a large seal habitat in the early winter maintained by the Lincolnshire Wildlife Trust. It is the only national nature reserve in the UK on MOD land, and was opened on 18 July 2002 by Air Commodore Nigel Williams. The bombing range covers an area of 885 hectares on land and 3200 hectares at sea. Airfield There was once a minor airfield there which was operational from 1936 and used as a decoy up until 1945. The airfield was home to No. 206 Squadron RAF from August 1941 - July 1942. The airfield acted as a Relief Landing Ground (RLG) for RAF North Coates, a former airfield (still in physical existence) which is three miles to the north-west along the coast. Radar station However, during the Second World War, RAF Donna Nook referred to a Chain Home Extremely Low (CHEL) radar station, sited a short distance away from the current establishment. This utilized a 10-cm radar set to track both low-flying intruders and German E-boats cruising offshore, and was operational in this role from 1943-1945. From evidence in his authorized biography (Odyssey: The Authorized Biography of Arthur C. Clarke; Neil McAleer, Gollancz, 1992) it appears that it was to RAF Donna Nook that the young Sir Arthur C. Clarke was posted in 1943, shortly after an interview with Wing Commander (later Sir) Edward Jefferson,RAF, who was subsequently Director of Telecommunications for the General Post Office. Bombing range The bombing range first opened up in 1926 with three bombing targets including one which was illuminated for night time bombing practice. The range closed in 1946 but was re-opened in 1976 when RAF Theddlethorpe was closed due to complaints from those living nearby. RAF Donna Nook is still used as an Air Weapons Range by UK, USAFE & NATO users and since 2008 has been administered by Defence Infrastructure Organisation (DIO), formerly Defence Training Estates (DTE).

It has small, neatly arranged, oval leaves and heads of pale pink to magenta or white flowers. It was one of the first verticordias to be collected, although it was not initially known by that name. The collection was made by Robert Brown on the Bass and Flinders circumnavigation of the Australian mainland on HMS Investigator. Description Verticordia brownii is an erect or rounded shrub which grows to a height of , spreading to and which has one main stem at its base. The main stem divides into small branches, upward to a flattened top. The leaves are oblong to egg-shaped, with the narrower end towards the base, concave, long with a blunt end. Leaves near the flowers are shorter than those further down the stems. The flowers are usually scented and arranged in corymb-like groups near the ends of the branches, each flower on an erect stalk long. The floral cup is shaped like half a flattened sphere, about long, constricted in the middle, warty and hairy near the base. The sepals are pale pink to magenta, fading to white and sometimes the sepals are white. They are long, with 3 or 4 feathery lobes and have one or two hairs up to long. The petals are the same colour as the sepals, long, and egg-shaped to almost circular. The style is straight, long and hairy near the tip. Flowering time is from December to February. The species closely resembles Verticordia eriocephala which was included in this species until 1991. Both have a woolly or \\"cauliflower\\" appearance, but V. eriocephala has a shorter, () glabrous style. The flowers of V. eriocephala are always white or creamy-white, whereas those of V. brownii are only sometimes that colour. Taxonomy and naming The first collections of this species were made in 1802 by Robert Brown at Lucky Bay in what is now Cape Le Grand National Park, during the Bass and Flinders circumnavigation of Australia. The type specimen was formally described in 1819 by Ren√© Louiche Desfontaines who gave the species the name Chamelaucium brownii in honour of the collector of the type. In 1828, de Candolle described the genus Verticordia and renamed the present species Verticordia brownii, making it one of the first of approximately 100 species placed in this genus. When Alex George reviewed the genus Verticordia in 1991, he placed this species in subgenus Verticordia, section Corymbiformis along with V. polytricha, V. densiflora, V. eriocephala and V. capillaris. Distribution and habitat This verticordia is found between Hopetoun and Mount Ragged in the Cape Arid National Park, extending inland almost as far as Grass Patch in the Esperance Plains and Mallee biogeographic regions. It occurs in deep red or yellow sands, especially in the ridges, coastal dunes, granitic sands and clays, within open scrub and heaths of the region. Conservation Verticordia brownii is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife. Use in horticulture This species began to be cultivated shortly after this discovery, its profuse and attractive flowering arrangement gaining the attention of nurserymen in England. The species is cultivated as an ornamental shrub, small in size, and usually presenting rose pink flowers that are profuse and perfumed. These appear during November, continuing until April in the garden, opening together and nearly covering the leaves and branches. It is usually propagated from cuttings and grows well in sandy, gravelly or loamy soils and the woolly heads of honey-scented flowers sometimes appear during the plant's first year of growth. The dried flowers are often used for flower arrangements and retain their colour for a considerable time.

The airfield was operational initially from 1916 being used by the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) and from April 1918 its successor the Royal Air Force (RAF) before being closed in 1920 however it was reopened in 1938 being used by the RAF until 1972. After 1972 the site was turned over to Her Majesty's Prison Service for the creation of two new prisons. History=First World War Acklington was an aerodrome during the First World War and known as Royal Flying Corps Station Southfields. Second World War The airfield was reopened on Friday 1 April 1938 being renamed to RAF Acklington where No. 7 Armament Training Station was formed which on 15 November 1938 transformed into No. 2 Air Observers School. During September 1939 the school moved to RAF Warmwell and the airfield was handed over to RAF Fighter Command as part of 13 Group where it became a sector airfield. The following squadrons were at some point posted or attached to RAF Acklington: * 43, 46, 111, 152, 245, 258, 600, 607 and 609. On 3 February 1940 three Hawker Hurricane fighters from 43 Squadron at Acklington intercepted and shot down a Luftwaffe Heinkel He 111 bomber at Whitby. The formation was led by Flight Lieutenant Peter Townsend. It was the first German aircraft to fall on English soil in World War II (although it was not the first to be shot down in the United Kingdom, that having occurred in Scotland). The intercept was based on a plot by operators at RAF Danby Beacon, a radar station about ten miles west of Whitby. Townsend visited the German rear gunner in hospital the next day, and visited him again in 1968 when Townsend was writing his highly-successful book about the Battle of Britain, \\"Duel of Eagles,\\" which recounts the incident in detail.Peter Townsend, Duel of Eagles, (New York, Simon and Schuster, 1970), pp 7-8. On 21 October 1942 well known test pilot Gerry Sayer departed from RAF Acklington in a Hawker Typhoon to test a gunsight during gun firing into Druridge Bay Ranges, and was accompanied by another Typhoon. Neither aircraft returned and it was assumed that they collided over the bay. Sayer was replaced as Gloster's chief test pilot by his deputy, Michael Daunt. =Battle of Britain= RAF Acklington was home to the following squadrons during the Battle of Britain: * 72 Squadron between 6 June 1940 and 31 August 1940 with the Supermarine Spitfire Mk I before moving to RAF Biggin Hill. * 79 Squadron between 13 July 1940 and 27 August 1940 with the Hawker Hurricane Mk I before moving to RAF Biggin Hill. * 32 Squadron between 28 August 1940 and 15 December 1940 with the Hurricane Mk I before moving to RAF Middle Wallop. * 610 Squadron between 31 August 1940 and 15 December 1940 with the Spitfire Mk I before moving to RAF Westhampnett. =October 1940‚Äì1945= The following squadrons were at some point posted or attached to RAF Acklington: * 1, 25, 43, 56, 63, 74, 130, 141, 164, 167, 198, 219, 222, 263, 266, 278, 288, 289, 291, 309, 315, 316, 317, 322, 349, 350, 406, 409, 410, 504, 539 and 609.

Her major works are Bibi Blocksberg and Benjamin Bl√ºmchen. Biography Donnelly spent her early childhood in Rugby in the English Midlands, and moved to Vienna in her later childhood. The daughter of an Irish father and an Austrian mother, she started a career in journalism already in her youth. In Vienna, she worked as a texter in the news agency APA, where her mother had also worked. In 1973 she moved to Berlin, married Peter Lustig and started writing H√∂rspiele (audio dramas) for children. She won the German prize for youth literature with her first book. In the 1980s, she became a disciple of Indian mystic Osho.Bhagwan: Glaube und Mammon, Der Spiegel, 6 February 1984 At present she lives with her current husband, author Paul Arat√≥, in Ibiza. Donnelly's two grown-up sons live in Austria and America. Works At age 26, Donnelly published her first book: Servus Opa, sagte ich leise, a story of a small boy telling about the death of his grandfather. The book won the German youth literature prize and the Hans-im-Gl√ºck prize in 1978. The book about the accompanying TV series won the Adolf Grimme prize in 1979. Two of her most famous series are Benjamin Bl√ºmchen (\\"Benjamin Blossom\\"), which deal with the adventures of the talking elephant Benjamin and his little friend, the boy Otto, and Bibi Blocksberg, a series about the adventures of a young cheeky witch. Since 1977, Donnelly has written 65 episodes of Benjamin Bl√ºmchen and 40 episodes of Bibi Blocksberg. After seven years, she sold the rights to the works and moved to Majorca. The Benjamin Bl√ºmchen audio cassettes have sold over 54 million copies. Summer 2007 marked the 30th anniversary of the series. Donnelly has also written the new H√∂rspiel and book series Elea Eluanda, a story about a disabled girl, who hasn't let her fate put her down, and is accompanied by her Indian friend Ravi and her \\"consoling owl\\" Ezechiel. Keeping in with Donnelly's style, all episodes of the series have easily recognisable signature sounds or phrases: Ezechiel's Aramba chol√© is as ubiquitous in the respective series as Bibi Blocksberg's Hex-hex or Benjamin Bl√ºmchen's T√∂r√∂√∂. Donnelly also writes poetry. Works for adults In adult literature, Donnelly has written two detective books for Piper Verlag: Kein einziges Wort and Wen der Tod entl√§sst. Both books star a German-Austrian female funeral parlor owner with a fondness for tango. For unknown reasons, critics have mainly ignored these books. ORF is planning a TV series based on the books. F√ºr Paare verboten, published by Hoffmann und Campe, is a caricature of the tantra therapy scene. Donnelly has also written an amusing travel guide Gebrauchsweisung f√ºr Mallorca (2002). Das Glasauge (Donnelly's autobiography), Wendelburgs Komplott and Die H√ºhnerleiter ins Nirvana are books-on-demand also available as e-book.

The chemical weapon store and former chemical weapon filling station are situated down the dead-end Station Road. Location The present main gate of RAF Barnham can be found directly off Bury Road (A134) between Barnham village and Thetford. The entrance to the former nuclear weapons store (now Gorse Industrial Estate) can be found on Elveden Road between Barnham village and the A11. History Military facilities had existed at Barnham since the First World War. During the Second World War, Barnham had been a chemical weapons storage and filling station for mustard gas. During 1953 or 1954, construction began on a high- security RAF bomb store on Thetford Heath. The site was to become known as RAF Barnham and construction was completed in 1955 with the site operational from September 1956. Barnham was constructed as a sister-site to a similar facility constructed a few years before at RAF Faldingworth. Both sites were built to store and maintain free-fall nuclear bombs and Barnham was able to supply the bomber squadrons at Honington, Marham, Watton, Wyton, Upwood and Bassingbourn. Barnham came under the control of the RAF's No. 94 Maintenance Unit. The operational life of Barnham was relatively short. By the early 1960s this type of storage facility became obsolete as free-fall nuclear bombs were superseded as the weapon of choice, for the British Nuclear Deterrent, by the Blue Steel stand-off missile. The storage and maintenance of nuclear weapons moved to the V bomber airfields. The last nuclear weapons were probably removed from the site by April 1963. The site was sold in 1966, and since that date it has been used as a light industrial estate. Nuclear weapons storage The site was built specifically to store and maintain free-fall nuclear bombs, such as Blue Danube. This specific purpose was reflected in the facility's layout: The site was roughly pentagonal in shape. It consisted of three large non-nuclear component stores, surrounded by earthwork banking and a number of smaller storage buildings to hold the fissile cores; the cores were held in stainless steel containers sunk into the ground. The larger buildings stored the bomb casings and the high-explosive elements of the weapons. The smaller stores (known as \\"Hutches\\") were constructed to hold the fissile core of the weapons. These hutches were further divided into type 'A' and 'B'. The 'A' type hutches having a single borehole for the storage of Plutonium cores and the 'B' type hutches having a double borehole for storing Cobalt cores. In total, there were 55 hutches giving enough capacity to store 64 fissile cores. Barnham had sufficient storage capacity for 132 fissile cores although it's likely that only a small number were ever stored there as only 25 Blue Danube bombs were ever built at a cost of ¬£1M per bomb. In addition to the storage buildings, the site consisted of a number of other buildings including a Fire Station, RAF Police flight, Administration block, Mess block, Mechanical Transport Section, Kennels and Workshops. The perimeter of the site was protected by a double system of chain-link fencing and an inner concrete-panel wall; all of which were topped with barbed wire. In 1959, security was enhanced by the building of watch towers around the perimeter. The former nuclear bomb storage facilities are designated as a scheduled monument by English Heritage. Several buildings on the site have listed building status.Photo gallery: Nuclear bomb store in Suffolk on English Heritage at risk list, Eastern Daily Press, 12 October 2012.

It is used as an accommodation and training venue for the Potential Gunners Acquaintance Course (PGAC). The adjacent MoD Training Area remains the property of the Ministry of Defence, and is still used by the RAF Regiment, as well as the Air Training Corps and Combined Cadet Force for training.  Future  In January 2016, it was announced that RAF Barnham would close. A Better Defence Estate, published in November 2016, indicates that the Ministry of Defence will dispose of the site by 2020. Domestic accommodation will be relocated to RAF Honington, with access to Barnham Training Area maintained. This was later extended to 2022.

History The crew of the Short Stirling Mark I, N3669 'LS-H', of No. 15 Squadron RAF watch as the scoreboard tally on their aircraft is chalked up with their 62nd raid, at Bourn, Cambridgeshire. N3669 went on to complete 67 operations, a record for the Stirling, before she was reduced to an instructional airframe in February 1943. Bourn Airfield was constructed for RAF Bomber Command in 1940 as a satellite airfield for nearby RAF Oakington. It was used by No. 101 Squadron RAF Vickers Wellingtons for training purposes from 23 July 1941, and from October of that year 101 and 7 Squadrons used the airfield when Oakington became unavailable. On 9 April 1941, the airfield was subjected to the first of four raids when a Junkers Ju 88C strafed the airfield buildings and bombed the runway; however, little damage was done and there were no injuries. Two more raids on 8 and 23 May 1944 were made, the latter damaging two parked de Havilland Mosquitoes. As the strategic bombing offensive intensified, the losses mounted. By the time of the last operational sortie on 4 April 1945, a total of 164 aircraft had been lost, either from the squadrons based at Bourn or from others trying, and failing, to land on the field. The average age of aircrew was 23 and over a third of these were under 20 years of age. Of the 886 listed names, 648 were killed and many of the 35 injured subsequently died of their wounds. The number killed was probably greater than that of the entire population of the village at the time. 97 Squadron's Avro Lancasters were replaced by the Mosquito IXs of 105 Sqn in March 1944. These Oboe-equipped aircraft were able to identify targets with great precision and then mark them accurately. In December 1944, 162 Squadron was formed at Bourn with Canadian-built Mosquito XXs and XXVs which flew almost nightly to Berlin, target-marking for the Light Night Strike Force. The two squadrons operated together from Bourn for much of the rest of the war. From 1941 to 1945, damaged Short Stirlings were repaired and test-flown from Bourn. These were transported to the airfield from the Sebro factory near Madingley which later continued its work with RAF and United States Army Air Forces (USAAF), Consolidated B-24 Liberators. The Bourn and Madingley units together employed up to 4,500 personnel. The following units were here at some point: * No. 23 Operational Training Unit RAF * No. 1323 Automatic Gun Laying Turret Flight RAF * No. 1409 Meteorological Flight RAF * No. 1696 (Bomber) Defence Training Flight RAF * No. 2708 Squadron RAF Regiment Post-war The airfield was passed on to RAF Maintenance Command in 1947. By 1948, the station was closed and the last sections were sold off for agricultural use in 1961. Current use Bourn Airfield viewed from Broadway in October 2013 Now the Rural Flying Corps uses part of the runway for light aircraft; small industrial developments occupy other areas of the site.

The book was published in 2004 by the William Morrow subsidiary of Harper-Collins books. Holley spent his days tracking the behind the scenes operations in the New England Patriots organization between their first and second Super Bowl wins, sitting in on meetings, and never being asked to exclude anything. Prohibited from nothing, Holley roamed the managerial meetings and team areas normally closed to the press, and conducted in depth interviews with scouts, coaches, and other Patriots insiders, up to and including owner Robert Kraft, and his son, President of the Patriots, Jonathan Kraft. Holley followed the team, day-to- day, from within the organization for nearly two full seasons as coach and de facto general manager Bill Belichick resumed the building of a model NFL franchise. The team's progression was interrupted by the Patriots' unexpected over victory over the St Louis Rams ‚Äî nicknamed \\"The Greatest Show on Turf\\" ‚Äî in Super Bowl XXXVI. Shortly after the surprise victory, Holley pitched his book concept to Belichick. The idea was rubber stamped by the Krafts, and Holley took a leave of absence from his work at the Globe to immerse himself in the New England Patriots. In February 2009, the book was cited by syndicated radio talk-show host Rush Limbaugh. Limbaugh discussed the passages in the book dealing with Belichick's philosophy that he found to be instructive on his program. Summary=Belichick's Background The first few chapters of the work set the stage and introduce the main Patriots 'characters' and their resumes. Rather than biographical minutiae, the book focuses on matters which would be most of interest to fans. The book begins by covering the early experiences of Bill Belichick as a young coach including his tutoring under his late father, Steven Belichick, a lifelong scout and coach for the United States Naval Academy football program whom he began to help \\"breaking down film\\" and recording (analyzing upcoming opponent) plays as early as age eleven. Belichick was so skilled at film analysis that when he took a position as a graduate intern where this was his job with the Baltimore Colts, his salary was doubled after only a few weeks. The book shifts to focus on the early coaching career of Belichick (from age 23) as he went from graduate intern to jobs as various positions coach under four different coaches in three different football organizations including Ted Marchibroda in Baltimore and Rick Forzano of the Detroit Lions. Holley all but ignores Belichick's ten years or so with the New York Giants as defensive co-ordinator and (eventually) as assistant coach -- where he established himself as an important defensive mind -- only touching on those years in passing. Only cursory mentions are made throughout the book of the achievements of Belichick's defenses, and the dominating Giants' teams he helped construct.. The book goes back to when Belichick was nearly hired as the head coach of the Phoenix Cardinals in 1987 before that team moved from St Louis. Belichick's Tenure in Cleveland Patriot Reign addresses the era four years later when Belichick would coach the Cleveland Browns, from 1991‚Äì1995. At the time, Belichick was the youngest NFL head coach, and one considered average at the time. The media disliked Belichick's policies of restricting access to the team after they'd enjoyed years of free access. Holley relates the Cleveland press's changing views about Belichick, and that he \\"may be worthy of respect\\", as he had taken a 2-14 team to 11-5 and the AFC playoffs in just three years. Holley covers the Browns' departure from Cleveland to Baltimore, that left Browns owner Art Modell the most hated man in Cleveland ‚Äî so much so that, only a few years prior, Modell wouldn't attend the funeral of a long time friend and associate, for fear of his life. Holley addresses mistakes that Belichick admits he made with the press, Browns' management and the eccentric owner Art Modell in his first position as head coach. This section reveals that Belichick resents the press's perception that he had been a Parcells disciple--which Belichick states is disrespectful of the other great coaches he worked under prior to working under Parcells. The following chapters highlight the author's opinion of Belichick as a complex man, cerebral coach, teacher and parent. The book highlights Belichick's penchant for levity and storytelling, while being profane as is needed. This part of his history concludes with how Belichick parted ways with owner Art Modell and did not follow the team in the 1996‚Äì97 off season to Baltimore where it was reincarnated as today's Baltimore Ravens and enters near-contemporary history when Belichick first joined the New England Patriots. Robert Kraft and Bill Parcells The book continues, focusing on 1996, when Belichick was hired immediately as by his old boss Bill Parcells to be the Patriots' defensive coordinator. (Belichick had worked under Parcells previously with the New York Giants.) The passage exposes the complex interpersonal dynamics governing the management interactions of the 1996 Patriots, the relationships between the Krafts and Parcells, and exposes key points in their characters, philosophies, and history. As the new assistant head coach for the New England Patriots, Belichick soon found he'd become the ombudsman to the novice owners Robert Kraft and his son Jonathan, who had a stormy relationship with Parcells, whom they inherited when Kraft bought the team. It was noted that there was \\"a history\\" between the owners and Parcells that was leading to a deterioration in the team's relationship. The book then pauses to give a football background history of Robert Kraft, and then moving tangentially into the Krafts's business history, touches on Kraft's financial evaluation that the Patriots could not be successful economically as a franchise without also owning the stadium and its revenues. Kraft couldn't afford to buy the Patriots in 1988, but when former Patriots owner Billy Sullivan sold the team to Victor Kiam, Kraft prevented Sullivan and Foxboro Stadium from going bankrupt by purchasing the stadium, making him the team's landlord. This positioned Kraft ‚Äî a lifelong Patriots fan ‚Äî to purchase the team in 1994. The reader learns how former Patriots owner James Orthwein, unable to move the team as he could not break the long term lease with Foxboro Stadium, put the team up for sale in 1994; this time Kraft was able to outbid all others for the team, even though he had to pay a large price for the team, $200,000,000. With the purchase, Kraft inherited a strong-minded head coach with whom he had no relationship. Holley next sketches in how the Krafts' business acumen improved the team's revenues, and established an ever-increasing fan base (in no small part by ending the dubious practice of blocking out local television coverage when there were seats available) which has resulted in consecutively increasing sales every years since, and a sold-out stadium since the 1996 season, with a waiting list for season tickets that goes for years. Despite the team's marketing successes in 1996, the relationship between Kraft and Parcells was strained, and got worse with time. The new owners, with their net worth on the line, were unwilling to give a carte blanche to Parcells to spend on football operations. The Krafts believed in giving management plenty of space, but not a blank check without occasional questions and answers. Parcells felt the owner was interfering with his prerogatives and what was needed to run a successful winning football franchise, especially in light of the new NFL salary cap which took effect in 1994. The result was a stalemate that led to Belichick ‚Äî as newly hired Assistant Head Coach ‚Äî mediating between the two in the 1996 season. Prior to the Patriots' appearance in Super Bowl XXXI, rumors dominated the sports media that Parcells intended to leave the Patriots after the Super Bowl, despite the fact Parcells was under contract through the 1997 season. These news reports were categorized as distracting and disruptive to the team in the weeks leading up to the Super Bowl. The team president of the Patriots (Jonathan Kraft) is quoted in the book as saying \\"It was a very, very strange time, and when you are not an expert at this business--you know we were still very new to the business--it can be educational. Big Bill (ie. Parcells) had kept us in the dark on a lot of things. He probably misled us on some things. And we didn't know how to go about questioning it.\\" After leaving New England, Parcells and Belichick were hired as the head coach and defensive coordinator for the New York Jets. Belichick was presumed to be the heir apparent to take over the Jets head coaching position after Parcells departure. But Belichick's tenure at the Jets helm was to be short lived. He infamously resigned after just one day as the team's head coach. Holley reveals Belichick's resignation was one sentence, which simply read, \\"I resign as HC of the NYJ\\", and was hand-written on a sheet of loose-leaf paper.

Serving the San Antonio Independent School District, Lanier boasts an enrollment of more than 1700 students. History Sidney Lanier High School first opened in 1915 as McKinley Elementary School. The school is named after Confederate poet Sidney Lanier, who came to San Antonio in 1872 in search of a cure for tuberculosis. He didn't find one but became enchanted with the Mexican flavor of San Antonio. In San Antonio, Lanier sought out the local historians and penned his long, essay entitled, \\"San Antonio de Bexar,\\" in 1873. In 1923, McKinley was renamed after Sidney Lanier in accordance with the District's practice of naming the junior schools after American authors. Lanier became a junior-senior high school in 1929 until 1969 when Tafolla Middle School opened. The new Lanier Campus, on the site of the old school, opened in 1975. Currently, Sidney Lanier High School serves 9th through 12th grade students. The most tumultuous event occurred between the years 1967 and 1969 when a group of students changed the curricular structure of the school amid cries of vocational tracking and insufficient academic college preparation. Student leaders Homer Garcia, Edgar Lozano, Stephen Castro, Irene Yanez, and other participants challenged the authority of the school and staged a walkout that catapulted Sidney Lanier into the limelight and forced district to adapt changes. Student Council President Pablo Ortiz was appointed by school administrators after Homer Garcia was deemed too disruptive and radical. Later, school administrators finally bowed to student and community pressure conceding to demands. Even though a massive walkout was averted, some students did stage their own protest march leaving the campus during lunch. In the end, the legacy benefited students to the point that more scholarships were awarded and change became apparent. The 1969 graduate, Homer Garcia, ultimately became an unsung hero and forged alliances with other campus leaders. He went on to graduate from the University of Texas culminating in a Ph.D. in sociology from Yale University. Other students involved indirectly were members of the Mexican American Youth Organization (MAYO)started by Mario Compean, Jose Angel Gutierrez, and Ignacio Garcia, all students at St. Mary's University. Student leaders from Edgewood High School and even former Central Catholic High School students contributed with ideas and participatory support. Former alumni from the pivotal year went on to author books and become professors (Rafael Castillo, Ignacio Garcia and Daniel Hernandez). Traditions Their mascot is a Vok, a gear emblem which symbolizes a smaller part of a big machine. Ultimately, the Vok represents an essential gear that would not function without support from its integral whole therefore analogous to a vocational student entering society and the workforce. Sidney Lanier was one of the first vocational schools in the westside of San Antonio. The school's most popular event, \\"The Chili Bowl,\\" an annual football game played yearly against its rival Fox Tech High School since 1932, was popular until Fox Tech closed. Although the term \\"Chili Bowl\\" has an underlying negative connotation with racist tint, the alumni adopted it nonetheless and reversed its negative effects by owning it. The district, however, announced in November 2009 that it would discontinue sports at Fox Tech as part of its plan to convert Fox Tech into a magnet school (football to be discontinued after the 2009-2010 year, and the remaining sports after two more years), thus ending the event after 2009. The Lanier Voks ended up winning the last game over the Buffaloes, 30 to 14. Afterwards both of the teams gathered in the center of Alamo Stadium, the place where this historic event was held, and took time to reflect on what this tradition meant to them, and how it felt to take part in this game.

First opened as an RAF station in 1940 and used for radar training, it had no airfield. The site is often confused with RAF Yatesbury that was constructed partly within the parish of Compton Bassett in 1916. During the Second World War, RAF Yatesbury and RAF Compton Bassett were major Radio and Radar Training Schools, RAF Townsend a satellite landing ground and RAF Cherhill was No 27 Group Headquarters Technical Training Command. After the war it became a trade training camp for certain ground Signals trades. Many thousands of newly recruited RAF personnel, most having just completed their 8 weeks basic training, were taught their RAF trade skills at RAF Compton Bassett, so as to become competent Radar Operators PPI, Wireless Operators, Teleprinter Operators, Telegraphists or Telephonists before being posted to work at RAF operational stations and airfields elsewhere in the United Kingdom or abroad. As well as their trade training, personnel experienced tougher service discipline at Compton Bassett than on operational stations. There were frequent parades involving military drill, regular \\"stand by your beds\\" inspections of personal appearance, kit inspections and inspections of barrack hut accommodation. Being put on a charge for not being up to required standard, resulting in Jankers, was very commonly experienced by personnel while being trade trained there. It also became home of the No. 3 Radio School RAF, which in the 1950s trained later washing machine entrepreneur John Bloom, The local coach company Cards of Devizes provided contracted coaches to the RAF, which on a Saturday afternoon would take the airmen to London on their 36-hour passes. Bloom decided with a friend who ran a coach company in Stoke Newington that they could underprice the Card/RAF's coaches. When Cards took Bloom to court, the judge upheld Bloom with a declaration that became Bloom's motto: \\"It's no sin to make a profit.\\" USAF housing After the station closed in the 1960s, the housing around the camp continued to be used after the main station had shut by RAF staff working at RAF Lyneham and other nearby RAF stations. In the 1980s the housing was used for United States Air Force personnel stationed at airfields such as RAF Fairford and RAF Greenham Common. The housing was later sold to private buyers.

Haviland marshaled support, drawing on his association with the University of Washington and his \\"clinical sense, wisdom, political acumen and knowledge\\" of the Seattle community to ensure that the new center operated on a not-for-profit basis. In 1962, Haviland and Scribner launched the **Seattle Artificial Kidney Center** , which changed its name to Northwest Kidney Center in 1970 when its services spread beyond Seattle. The name changed again, to Northwest Kidney Centers, in 1992 when there were multiple locations. In 1964, Time magazine reported that to treat 11 patients, the Seattle Artificial Kidney Center had a staff of two full-time physicians and one half-time physician, plus five nurses and five technicians. During these early years of hemodialysis, funding was extremely limited, requiring rationed access to the few available dialysis machines. A committee of physicians screened potential patients first by strict medical criteria. Patients who passed the initial medical screening were then further reviewed by an anonymous lay committee which decided who would get treatment. In 1962, Life magazine published an article on the Seattle dialysis screening committee, which it dubbed the ‚ÄúLife or Death Committee.‚Äù The discussion the article generated led to the development of biomedical ethics as a field of professional study. In 1964, Scribner's presidential address to the American Society for Artificial Internal Organs discussed the problems of patient selection, termination of treatment, patient suicide, death with dignity, and selection for transplantation. Early milestones By 1964, Seattle Artificial Kidney Center had expanded to 10 stations serving 47 patients‚Äîgrowth that led to financial strain. In response, Scribner and his team developed home hemodialysis, training patients to treat themselves from home, reducing operational costs. In 1972, the U.S. Congress passed legislation authorizing the end-stage renal disease program of Medicare. Section 299I of Public Law 92-603, on October 30, 1972, extended Medicare coverage to over 90 percent of Americans if they had permanent kidney failure and therefore required dialysis or kidney transplantation to live. This funding led to wider availability of dialysis nationally and spurred the growth of Northwest Kidney Center. In 1978, Northwest Kidney Center began offering peritoneal dialysis in addition to its hemodialysis services: first, continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) and later automated peritoneal dialysis (APD). Together with the Puget Sound Blood Center and the University of Washington Department of Orthopedics, Northwest Kidney Center jointly founded the Northwest Tissue Center in 1988. Housed at the blood center, the tissue center provided human bone, tendons, skin and other tissues for transplantation. Present work Northwest Kidney Centers opened three new dialysis clinics in 2018, two in Federal Way and one in Fife, Washington. As a nonprofit supported by financial donors, Northwest Kidney Centers is able to provide supplementary services in addition to kidney dialysis. These include special care for the most fragile patients, free health education for people at every stage of kidney disease, patient access to dental care, staff scholarships, fellowships for doctors doing advanced kidney study, and funding for research. Northwest Kidney Centers‚Äô full-service outpatient renal- specialty pharmacy, one of the first in the nation, serves people with advancing chronic kidney disease, on dialysis, or living with a kidney transplant. In 2008, Northwest Kidney Centers collaborated with UW Medicine in the creation of the Kidney Research Institute. Funding from Northwest Kidney Centers helps equip and maintain laboratories and pay for preliminary investigations that pave the way for larger research grants. Northwest Kidney Centers donates clinical research space in its facilities where Kidney Research Institute investigators meet with patients. In 2017, Nephrology News & Issues magazine ranked Northwest Kidney Centers as the 8th largest dialysis provider in the United States. Also in 2017, Northwest Kidney Centers announced it would provide a $15 million grant over five years to UW Medicine's new Center for Dialysis Innovation to conduct research on innovative dialysis technologies. Museum On November 10, 2012, during its 50th anniversary year, Northwest Kidney Centers opened a museum and gallery dedicated to the history of the organization and of dialysis treatment. Located in Seattle, the museum showcases photos, artifacts, dialysis machines and equipment. In 2016, the organization established a professional archive to preserve and share its history. Patient care Northwest Kidney Centers provides 276,500 treatments a year for more than 1,750 people with kidney disease, representing about 80 percent of all dialysis care in Washington's King and Clallam counties. The organization treats patients in its 18 outpatient dialysis centers and in eight area hospitals. 250 of its patients choose home dialysis, with training and supervision from Northwest Kidney Centers. Its special care service provides additional nursing and assistance to very frail patients. In 2017, Northwest Kidney Centers launched the nation's first palliative care program in a dialysis organization. Education Northwest Kidney Centers provides free classes on issues related to kidney disease, including nutrition, types of dialysis treatment and kidney transplants. In 2017, more than half of new patients had attended a class before beginning dialysis. The organization also participates in events and health fairs throughout the year, and its nutrition experts not only counsel patients on the role of nutrition in preventing and treating kidney disease, they also contribute articles to professional journals and columns to community newspapers. Research Through its Kidney Research Institute, Northwest Kidney Centers conducts research into the early detection, prevention and treatment of kidney disease and its complications. The Kidney Research Institute has received more than $100 million in research funding, primarily from the National Institutes of Health, and published more than 1,000 scientific papers. More than 30 studies are actively underway. In 2017, Northwest Kidney Centers committed to a $15 million grant over five years to jumpstart the Center for Dialysis Innovation, which works on revolutionary new technologies. Innovation As the world's first dialysis organization, Northwest Kidney Centers created protocols and procedures that were innovative in themselves. From its establishment in 1962, the organization has been a model in the kidney care field. Home hemodialysis In 1964, Scribner and his team developed a machine to provide home hemodialysis for the first time. The machine, first used by Seattle Artificial Kidney Center patients, became a model for today's dialysis machines. EPO studies In the 1980s, Northwest Kidney Centers was the first site chosen for human studies on a synthetic form of erythropoietin (EPO), genetically engineered and later marketed as Epogen by Amgen, Inc. Dr. Joseph W. Eschbach led the trials at Northwest Kidney Centers. His results, published in The New England Journal of Medicine in 1987, showed that artificial EPO reversed anemia in kidney patients. EPO hormone treatments have improved the well-being and quality of life of more than a million people with kidney disease. Wearable artificial kidney In 2014, researchers at the Kidney Research Institute received FDA approval for the first human study in the U.S. of the Wearable Artificial Kidney. Smaller and more portable than home dialysis machines, the device is worn like a tool belt, and it administers dialysis via a catheter. Northwest Kidney Centers dialysis patients are among the research trial participants. Awards In 2009, President and CEO Joyce F. Jackson received Washington State Board of Health's 2009 Warren Featherstone Reid Award for Excellence in Healthcare for her leadership and dedication to Northwest Kidney Centers. In 2010, Northwest Kidney Centers received the Washington State Hospital Association Community Health Leadership Award, which honors healthcare organizations that best serve their community's broad health needs. The award recognized Northwest Kidney Centers‚Äô chronic kidney disease education program, offered free to the community. In 2013, Northwest Kidney Centers was recognized in PR Daily's Nonprofit PR Awards for 2012's best traditional marketing campaign. The award cited 50th-anniversary initiatives in public health, public policy and public education. In 2014, Seattle Magazine named CEO Joyce Jackson an Outstanding Health Care Executive as part of its annual Leaders in Healthcare Awards. In 2015, Qualis Health named Northwest Kidney Centers as the recipient of its 2015 Award of Excellence in Healthcare Quality: Outpatient Services. The award recognized the nonprofit's Improving Kidney Transplantation Initiative's impact on improving health care quality and outcomes.

The islands are uninhabited and are covered with tundra vegetation, shingle and ice. The climate in these islands and the surrounding waters is extremely severe with frequent gales and blizzards in the winter. The sea surrounding the archipelago is covered with fast ice most of the year and is obstructed by pack ice even in the summer. Etymology The island group was known as Saint Samuel IslandsNicholas II Land, Bulletin of the American Geographical Society Vol. 46, No. 2 (1914), pp. 117-120 (named after Samuel the Confessor) before the 1917 Russian Revolution and then they were renamed after Komsomolskaya Pravda, being for a while the only island group in the world named after a newspaper.–ì–µ–æ–≥—Ä–∞—Ñ–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–µ –Ω–∞–∑–≤–∞–Ω–∏—è This situation lasted only until the Izvesti Tsik Islands were given their name after newspaper Izvestia. The original name of the islands, \\"Samuila\\", was retained for one of the islands of the group though. Geography These islands are located in the Laptev Sea coastal region, off the mouth of the Simsa Bay in the Taymyr Peninsula. This island group belongs to the Krasnoyarsk Krai administrative division of Russia. The largest islands are Ostrov Samuila and Ostrov Bol'shoy (also known as Ostrov Stolovidnyy). Both of them belong to the offshore subgroup, which geographically is sometimes referred to as the proper Komsomolskaya Pravda Islands. The strait between these islands is known as Proliv Diksonskikh Gidrografov (Hydrographer Dikson Strait). The smaller islands that are located close to the coast at the mouth of the Simsa Bay: Udobnyy, Vilkitsky (or Srednyy), Kraynyy (also known as Sliyaniye) and small Kuropachiy (known also as \\"Avanpost\\" and \\"Forpost\\"), form another subgroup that is also known as the Vilkitsky Islands (Ostrova Vil'kitskogo). These are named after geographer Boris Vilkitsky and should not be confused with the Vilkitski (or Dzhekman) Islands that are part of the Nordenskjold Archipelago or with other islands also called \\"Vilkitsky\\". Uzbekistan Island, named after the former Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic, has an intermediate position between the two subgroups of the Komsomolskaya Pravda Islands. Just around the corner of the north east point of the nearby mainland lies small Fram Island (–û—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–≤ –§—Ä–∞–º–∞; Ostrov Frama), which was named after Norwegian explorer Fridtjof Nansen's ship Fram. History These islands were first reported in 1736 by Russian explorer Vasili Pronchishchev. In 1933 the newly formed Glavsevmorput' (Chief Administration of the Northern Sea Route) dispatched the first convoy of freighters via the Northern Sea Route to the mouth of the Lena to deliver cargoes bound for the Yakut ASSR. It consisted of three freighters and was escorted by the icebreaker Krasin. Despite heavy ice conditions in the Kara Sea two of the ships reached Tiksi, their destination, and unloaded their cargoes. The third ship, Pravda was bound for Bukhta Nordvik with an oil exploration expedition. Despite warnings, Pravda ran aground near its destination and turned back. Severe ice conditions in the Vilkitsky Strait (between Severnaya Zemlya and Cape Chelyuskin), forced the three freighters of the convoy, the Pravda, the Volodarskiy and the Tovarich Stalin to winter at Ostrov Samuila in the Komsomolskaya Pravda Islands. A shore station was built and a full scientific programme maintained all winter by N. N. Urvantsev and his wife, Dr. Yelizaveta Ivanovna. Urvantsev used the base to explore the Taymyr Peninsula. These ships were released in the following year by Icebreaker Feodor Litke. Battering heavily the ice around the Komsomolskaya Pravda Islands for one week, the Feodor Litke finally succeeded in breaking the freighters free after carving a 10 km channel with so much effort that its hull suffered grievous damage.William Barr, The First Soviet Convoy to the Mouth of the Lena.

Species belonging to the genus Pheretima have a clitellum, which is a band of glandular tissue present on segments 14 to 16. Individuals are hermaphroditic and reproduction can be either sexual or parthenogenetic. Female genital pores lie on the ventral surface of segment 14. A pair of male genital pores is situated ventrally on segment 18. Genital papiliae may also be present ventrally. As with all earthworms, development of young is without a larval stage and takes place in cocoons. Pheretima are generally nocturnal, like most earthworms, and have an aversion to light. They come out only at night, and feed and reproduce only at night. Similar to most earthworms, they must keep their body surface wet to respire. They are also called farmer's friend as they help in making the soil porous for easy irrigation. Similar genera include Amynthas, Archipheretima, Duplodicodrilus, Metaphire, Metapheretima, Pithemera, and Polypheretima.

Fairlop is now a district in the London Borough of Redbridge, England. History= First World War  A site to the east of RAF Fairlop called \\"Hainault Farm\\" was used during the First World War, and saw service as a Royal Air Force Home Defence Flight Station. A number of airmen died at Fairlop during and shortly after the war. In 1919, Sergeant Russe J. Cound was killed and Captain Starbuck seriously injured when their plane stalled and crashed from a height of 200 feet.  Between the wars  A small flying club used another nearby site between the wars and there were plans to build a commercial airport in the Fairlop area for London, but those plans were later abandoned due to the realization that smog and haze from the residential and industrial areas nearby would be a hazard to operations. A further three sites just to the north of Fairlop and Hainault Farm were used as civilian aerodromes mid-war (see \\"Fields of the First\\", by Paul A Doyle, 1997).  Second World War  The airfield at Fairlop was built in late 1940 when three concrete runways in an \\"A\\" pattern tilted 45 degrees anti-clockwise were constructed. The airfield became operational in September 1941 with the arrival of No. 603 (City of Edinburgh) Squadron RAF, flying Supermarine Spitfires, previously stationed at RAF Hornchurch. The adjacent Hainault Lodge was used as officer accommodation. In June 1944 RAF Fairlop became home to No. 24 Balloon Centre with four squadrons forming part of the balloon barrage around London. The balloons were manned by members of the Women's Auxiliary Air Force. No 24 Balloon Centre was disbanded in February 1945 and the airfield closed in August 1946.  After the wars  In 1947, plans we revived to build a commercial airport at Fairlop. At the time, it was reported that Fairlop could become the \\"No. 1 continental airport\\", but again the plans fell through. By 1950, the airfield was disused. It is believed that the site was one of the first RAF airfields to trial underground hangars (the remains of one of which could be seen on the east side of Feltwell, Norfolk up to the 1970s) but no trace of any such works have been located at Fairlop.

It involved the forceful migration of groups of extended families or ethnic groups from their home territory to lands recently conquered by the Incas. The objective was to transfer both loyalty to the state and a cultural baggage of Inca culture such as language, technology, economic and other resources into areas that were in transition. The term mitma is a Quechua word meaning \\"sprinkle, distribute, spread\\". Top√≥nimos del Quechua Yungay . Retrieved on November 29, 2007. The term comes from the Quechua word \\"mitmat\\", which meant ‚Äúman moved, transported‚Äù or ‚Äúoutsider‚Äù.de Freitas 2009, 154 It is related to another Inca word, \\"mit'a\\", which means labor taken in turns and is descended from the Quechua verb \\"mitmay\\". The Spanish also adopted the term \\"mit'a\\", and adapted the word to mean forced native labor during the Spanish colonial rule.Mannheim 1991, 92 This policy moved entire communities hundreds of kilometers to create enclaves of settlers called mitmaqkuna. This policy was used over a long period of time in all border regions of the empire. Modern anthropological and linguistic studies suggest that about a quarter to a third of the population of the empire was resettled and is probably the largest single element of the Inca domination.Terence D'Altroy 2003, p.248. The strategic and political use of this policy might have also been related to transhumancy, when large herds of llamas, alpacas and vicu√±as were managed by the state. The element of political stability is obvious as the new settlements depended on the Incas for defense, supplies and governance. Political use Because the ethnic Inca were outnumbered by the population they ruled over by 100 to 1, there were many political systems they employed to control their conquered people.D'Altroy 2003, 231 The mitma policy was one method that involved planned transfers of entire populations to regions that were less developed or had a high degree of rebellions or uprisings.de Freitas 2009, 154 Provinces that were loyal were moved and resettled in new or hostile territories, while rebellious villages were moved to consolidated regions.Moseley 1992, 10 By using such methods, the ethnic Inca were able to help diminish resistance to the Inca nobility.de Freitas 2009, 154 Outside of Cuzco, much of the Inca government consisted of Inca officials that supervised a hierarchy of hereditary ethnic lords who were drafted into state service. The mitma system was effective because instead of trying to invent new governments, they just shuffled about existing ethnic groups.D'Altroy 2003, 231 The Inca kept great tabs on their populace in order to ensure that challenges to their authority did not occur. This included keeping detailed documents, such as a census of the population once they had been resettled.D'Altroy 2003, 236 Once in their new settlement places, the mitmas participants received land to plant crops and raise livestock, as well as to build houses. By doing this, the Inca allowed mitma populations to reproduce their original social and production structure.de Freitas 2009, 154 Another way they kept the population in check was by having strict punishments for lawbreakers. If a resettled person tried to return to his native home, he was tortured. If he attempted to do so a second-time, the offender was executed.D'Altroy 2003, 236 In addition, the Inca kept resettled elites in check by promoting them to bureaucratic positions in order to keep them dependent on imperial systems and ideologies for their own prestige and status.Covey 2000, 120 Inca control In order to show their domination, the Inca required newly captured groups to adopt practices that would distinguish them from neighboring groups. For example, members of the Huancavelicas extracted six of each settlers' front teeth. To further perpetuate local differences, settlers were required to retain their traditional garb and practices after they were relocated.Patterson 1987, 123 These policies allowed the state to monitor the movement of its subjects, and officials could easily determine who belonged in a particular region and who was not supposed to be there. As mentioned, being found out of place had severe repercussions. However, even not wearing traditional costumes were crimes against the state punishable by torture or death.Patterson 1987, 123 Areas affected At the beginning of the fifteenth century, the Inca imperial state came into existence. Before that time, Inca only sporadically attacked its neighbors in the Cuzco Valley, but it was still a weak, tribute- based state.Patterson 1987, 118 The Inca conquer began in the 1420s by reconstructing Cuzco after driving out the warriors of a powerful rival dominion, the Chancas. These were inhabitants of the territory northeast of Cuzco. The Tawantinsuyu (the realm of the Inca centered on Cuzco) originated from this transformation.Pease 1981, 247 After imposing rule over their neighbors, the Incas seized an opportunity to intervene in the internal affairs of those living further south in the Urubamba Valley and the Titicaca Basin.Patterson 1987, 118 The Mitma policy has been well documented at the Bolivian plateau, specifically the Titicaca Basin. Under Inca administration, the coast and western slope between Peru and Chile were considered a distinct administrative region populated by enclaves of atiplano colonists.Covey 2000, 122 In addition to the Titicaca Basin, the Inca forces went north and stormed Cajamarca, capturing it and leaving a small garrison there.Patterson 1987, 119 The Inca then returned to Cajamarca later in order to reinforce the isolated garrison at Cajamarca.Patterson 1987, 123 Before returning to the capital, the Inca extended imperial control northward into the Ecuadorian highlands. The Inca forces then pushed the southern frontier of the empire into Northwest Argentina and Central Chile.Patterson 1987, 119 Population swaps were also used in the territory of present-day Ecuador and had a large impact in the population mix of the region. In the area of Tumipamba, the transition was almost complete.

The company continued to make large diesel engines into the late 1940s.http://www.tugboatenthusiastsociety.org/Pages/tugmach-diesel- ancient-ent-01.htm There are a few known Enterprise engines remaining. Beginning In 1886, Martens and two business partners, James William Heaney and A. Anderson, developed a new business supplying industrial equipment castings. Their primary focus was on gold mining machinery, consisting mainly of compression cylinder castings for large engines. After the notorious 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fire, the Enterprise Engine and Machinery Company played a significant role in the rebuilding of the city. Their recovery activities provided Martens and his partners additional opportunities to stimulate the growth of and the momentum to expand their business. Crucible steel In 1915, the company acquired a crucible steel foundry. Shortly after this purchase, Martens and his partners established a brass and bronze foundry in Los Angeles. In 1917, the company constructed an electric arc furnace for use in its steel foundry. This was the only foundry of its type on the west coast, and it ultimately replaced the old crucible steel process. In the same year, a new engine department was created, and a team of engineers was hired to design and manufacture various types of heavy-duty engines fuelled by gas and distillates. Engines The first engines produced by the team were single-cylinder, rated at eight horsepower. The following engines were twin- cylinder, rated at . In a short time, designs were developed for engine models capable of producing up to . Stemming from the success of their gas and distillate fuel engines, the engineers set out to create a line of diesel engines. At this time, the cost of operating a diesel engine was approximately 20 cents per hour, compared to the $2.75 for gasoline engines. This economical Enterprise Diesel engine became very popular in a number of industries which had previously utilized gas powered engines. Merger with Western Machinery Company In 1924, The Enterprise Engine and Machinery Company merged with the Western Machinery Company of Los Angeles. This merger made the new organization the premier manufacturer of internal combustion engines on the west coast. In an effort to diversify the range of products, the company began selling oil burners and food processing equipments. World War II During World War II, Enterprise built hundreds of diesel engines for the United States Navy for tugs, harbor craft, small vessels, and auxiliary electric generators on larger ships. In addition, many Enterprise engines were sold to drive electric power generators in cities and towns across America. Merger with Adel Precision Products Company In the mid-1950s, after many decades of growth, Enterprise Engine & Foundry Company merged with Adel Precision Products Company of Burbank, part of the General Metals Corporation. This gave rise to a substantial increase of the company's engineering and production capacity and its testing and research capability. The Enterprise had the necessary resources allowing them to manufacture diesel engines ranging from to . These are now being utilized in almost every conceivable type of prime- mover application from powering boats and pumping oil to generate electricity. From its modest beginnings in 1886, Enterprise had become a mammoth division of a major American corporation. Developments since 1960 Between 1960 and 1990, Enterprise Engine & Foundry Company changed its ownership numerous times. These transitional decades were accompanied by a major downturn in domestic demand for large power engines. The strong US dollar and rising interest rates hurt Enterprise's export sales. In the late 1960s, Enterprise Engine & Foundry Company was purchased by Delaval Turbine. Then in the 1970s, Delaval Turbine was acquired by Transamerica Corporation. In 1987, Transamerica elected to spin off the Delaval operations to its shareholders in the form of a dividend. The name was changed to IMO Delaval. In 1988, IMO Delaval sold the Enterprise after market services to Cooper Industries, which in turn, spun off its oil and gas related holdings to Cameron Corporation, previously known as Cooper Cameron Corporation. Cooper Machinery Services is the current original equipment manufacturer for Enterprise engines.

History The RAF station of Hednesford was built just south of Cannock Chase, above the village of Hednesford in 1938/39, on land purchased from the Marquess of Anglesey. Ten officers and fifty other ranks arrived in mid-March 1939. It operated as No 6 School of Technical Training. Royal Air Force and Fleet Air Arm mechanics received technical training on a variety of airframes and engines. The first intake of trainees arrived in April 1939, transferred from RAF Halton. In June 1939 Sir Kingsley Wood, Secretary of State for Air, visited the camp, by which time it already had 1,700 trainees.\\"Kitbag Hill - The Story of RAF Hednesford\\" by CJ Whithouse, Published by CJ and GP Whithouse 1987 page 10 Accommodation consisted of wooden barrack huts (over 200 of them at their peak). Three large \\"Hinaidi\\" hangars housed the instructional aircraft and there was a large steel-framed workshop building of 70,000 square feet (6,500 square metres). During the War it grew to accommodate 4,000 trainees and 800 staff. Although it had no proper airfield at least three instructional aircraft were flown in and landed on the camp sports field.\\"Kitbag Hill - The Story of RAF Hednesford\\" by CJ Whithouse, Published by CJ and GP Whithouse 1987 page 37 A platform was built on the local railway line at Moor's Gorse (Brindley Halt) to serve the camp. The road from the railway halt to the camp was steep and acquired the name \\"Kitbag Hill\\". The last intake for No 6 School of Technical Training was in 1947. \\"Kitbag Hill - The Story of RAF Hednesford\\" by CJ Whithouse, Published by CJ and GP Whithouse 1987 page 21 After that RAF Hednesford became a demobilization centre and transit camp, and then a despatch centre, preparing personnel for overseas postings. \\"Kitbag Hill - The Story of RAF Hednesford\\" by CJ Whithouse, Published by CJ and GP Whithouse 1987 page 13 In 1950 it reopened as No 11 School of Recruit Training where many National Servicemen received their basic training. It was very first base of most personnel there during the 1940s and 1950s. most of whom were newly called up in the rank of AC2 (the very lowest rank in the RAF) for their 2 years National Service in the British armed forces known as a \\"square bashing camp\\" in the vernacular. New recruits into the RAF were given their initial training, which included first learning of RAF parade ground drill with rifles, intensive physical fitness training, training in ground combat and defence under Non Commissioned Officers of the RAF Regiment and some education about the RAF and its history. Men while undergoing their basic training at Hednesford were accommodated in wooden barrack huts, each one housing about twenty men. As usual with any military basic training camp discipline was very much stricter than it would be at any normal operational or trade training camp. Recruits normally spent a period of 8 weeks (later on 6 weeks) on their training at Hednesford before being posted on to their \\"trade training\\" camp elsewhere in the United Kingdom. Thousands of conscripts went through its gates up until 1956. Ten days after the last passing out parade at RAF Hednesford, 800 refugees from Hungarian Uprising of 1956 moved in, the first batch of a total of some 1,200. The RAF initially helped with feeding arrangements although the camp was run by Staffordshire welfare services. \\"Kitbag Hill - The Story of RAF Hednesford\\" by CJ Whithouse, Published by CJ and GP Whithouse 1987 page 12 In 1958 the Air Ministry announced it planned to sell the site. In April 1959, a sale of all the moveable buildings and equipment on the site was arranged (except for the officer's mess a small number of huts in the North-East corner). This included the large steel-framed workshop (which was rebuilt in nearby Chasetown) and the Hinaidi Hangers.\\"Kitbag Hill - The Story of RAF Hednesford\\" by CJ Whithouse, Published by CJ and GP Whithouse 1987 page 13 The site was neglected for many years. Various plans for the sale of the site fell through and it was becoming vandalised and dangerous with the air-raid shelters still remaining and increased subsidence from old mine-workings. In 1962 some of the site was cleared by 213 Field Squadron Royal Engineers (TA) from Cannock and 293 Squadron from Stafford. The remaining buildings in the North-East corner of the site were used by the Army as \\"No 81 Week End Training Centre\\" used by Territorial and Cadet units ( a caretaker's bungalow, firing range and some other buildings were added). In 1963 the camp was acquired by Staffordshire council who had the remaining air-raid shelters demolished and the mining subsidence filled in. Access to the site was restricted for some time to allow vegetation and wildlife to regenerate, although it was sometimes used for military training exercises and the training of police dogs. The week-end Training centre was closed. The whole old camp area is now part of Cannock Chase Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty with a visitor centre on the site (first opened in 1983).

A longtime associate of Gabe Paul, Seghi was credited with signing Pete Rose, the all-time leader in hits, when Seghi was farm system and scouting director of the Cincinnati Reds in 1960. He was from Cedar Point, Illinois, attended Northwestern University, and was an infielder in minor league baseball during his playing career. After World War II, Seghi was a manager in the lower minor leagues in 1946‚Äì55, working in the Pittsburgh Pirates and Cleveland Indians organizations. After joining the Redlegs (as the Reds were known from 1953‚Äì58) as a scout, Seghi succeeded Bill McKechnie Jr. as Cincinnati's farm director after the season. Serving under Paul and his successor, Bill DeWitt, Seghi remained with the Reds until 1968, a period during which the Reds built a player development organization that provided the foundation for the \\"Big Red Machine\\" dynasty. In 1963, Seghi was promoted by DeWitt to assistant general manager, but a change in ownership and the arrival of Bob Howsam in 1967 as GM caused Seghi to leave Cincinnati for the Oakland Athletics at the close of that season. Led by flamboyant owner Charlie Finley and awash with young talent, the A's also were on the verge of a dynasty, winning five consecutive American League West Division titles (1971‚Äì75) and three consecutive AL pennants and World Series titles (1972‚Äì74). From 1968‚Äì71 Seghi served as Oakland's farm and scouting director and assistant to Finley, who was his own general manager. By 1972, however, Seghi was back working with Paul as assistant general manager of the Cleveland Indians, and succeeded Paul as the Indians' GM in 1973. His most notable achievement occurred after the 1974 season, when he and owner Nick Mileti appointed Frank Robinson (signed and developed by the Cincinnati farm system of the 1950s) as Major League Baseball's first African-American manager. Seghi would serve 13 full seasons as Cleveland's general manager, but the Indians enjoyed only three above-.500 seasons during that time (, and ). Seghi stepped down after the 1985 campaign to become a senior player personnel adviser with Cleveland. He died of cancer in Thousand Oaks, California, on January 8, 1987, at the age of 77.

Also in 1943, RAF Madley became a base for one of ten Royal Air Force Mountain Rescue Teams (MRT) that had been set up to rescue lost aircrew. The site was visited in 1944 prior to D-Day by US General George S. Patton, and later by Rudolf Hess (who had been held prisoner near Abergavenny) on his way to the Nuremberg Trials in 1946. The station was not bombed by the Luftwaffe, however, as with other bases, crashes of friendly aircraft were commonplace. On Christmas Day 1944, a Liberator crashed in the station environs which precipitated the usual search for the crew. This had proved fruitless as the crew had baled out over Belgium as they assumed the heavily flak-damaged aircraft was about to crash.

It was used by No. 2 Group in July 1940 for No. 218 Squadron which had recently returned from France. In September, Oakington was passed on for the No. 2 Group which stationed the first Short Stirling Squadron No. 7. The newly formed No. 3 Photographic Reconnaissance Unit RAF started to use RAF Oakington to conduct high altitude work for Bomber Command's target. However there were poor surface conditions at RAF Oakington so No. 3 PRU often operated from RAF Alconbury. Post war Vickers Varsity navigation trainer of No.5 FTS in 1971 During the 1950s RAF Oakington was an Advanced Flying Training School, No. 5 Flying Training School RAF (5 FTS), which reformed at the airfield on 1 June 1954. Its initial role was to convert trainee pilots to jets using De Havilland Vampire FB5 single seat jets and Vampire T11 twin-seat jets. In March 1962 these types were exchanged for the Vickers Varsity T.1 twin piston-engine pilot trainers. 5 FTS was disbanded on 31 December 1974 when the need for training on piston engined aircraft reduced.Sturtivant et al, 1997, p. 153 The airfield was then closed, becoming a British Army barracks. The airfield's land area had contracted after the war, and much evidence of this former military use is visible in farmland surrounding the current perimeter. British Army use The barracks were used in the late 1970s and through the 1980s as a transit camp for units moving between Germany and Northern Ireland. It was also a permanent base for 657 Squadron Army Air Corps in the 1980s. The barracks were occupied by the Royal Highland Fusiliers from 1989 to 1993 and by the Cheshire Regiment from 1993 to 1996. Immigration Reception Centre In 2000 the station domestic area was leased to the Home Office, and converted for use as Oakington Immigration Reception Centre until November 2010. Future use Since 2007 plans have been developed to build Northstowe, a new settlement of 9,500 houses on the site. Demolition of parts of the site commenced in late January 2011 by the contractor Sovereign Plant Ltd. Work started on the first 1500 homes and related facilities in 2014.

His reign was from the early 1960s to 2006. In 1973, he became a member of the Ciskei National Assembly (Parliament) as a member of the ruling party, the Ciskei National Independent Party (CNIP). On the 17 May 1976, he became a member of the Ciskei cabinet for the position of Minister of Justice. In 1977, he was elected to Minister of Health and after 1978, when Ciskei became a one-party state, he became the Whip of the CNIP. During his term as Minister of Health he was prominent in the renaming of the Mdantsane Hospital to the Cecilia Makiwane Hospital, to commemorate Cecilia Makiwane, the first Black nurse in South Africa. In 1978 he was a director of CTC Bus Company Ltd. History of the Amakhuze The Amakhuze Tribe originated from Zulu land but in 1834 they escaped and went westward to the Transkei to escape the Mfecane under the leadership of their chief, Chief Jama. Jama settled with Hintsa, the then king of the Xhosa but Mqalo, Jama's son, split from Jama's group and crossed the Great Kei River and moved to Port Elizabeth, Fort Beaufort and in 1870 to Makhuzeni Location, Alice in the Tyume River valley. The area has become their tribal area and is still called this. During their migration, migrants of other clans and tribes joined them in their search for a place to settle. This migration followed the expulsion of the Ngqika under paramount Chief Sandile after the 1850-1853 Frontier War. The British cleared the Tyume valley of Xhosa who had settled there before Upon arrival, Chief Mqalo began to allocate land to different groups in different parts of the landscape which explains the occurrence of the villages: Gilton, Guquka, Sompondo and Mpundu, Kwezana etc. Genealogy The Mqalo family tree: See also *List of Xhosa Chiefs References *Ciskei Legislative Assembly (1976‚Äì1978).

K√ºbler Absinthe was first produced in 1863 and was the first brand to be sold legally in Switzerland after the national ban on absinthe was lifted in March, 2005. The legalization of absinthe in Switzerland is largely due to K√ºbler's lobbying efforts. The United States Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) approved the formula for K√ºbler Absinthe in 2004, and approved the product for sale in the United States in May 2007 after three years of discussions among K√ºbler, Food and Drug Administration, TTB, and U.S. Customs and Border Protection. These discussions proved to be instrumental in opening the door for many brands of absinthe to be legally sold or produced in the United States. K√ºbler was launched in 1863 by J. Fritz K√ºbler in M√¥tiers, Switzerland and is now a part of the Altamar Brands portfolio. M√¥tiers is the capital of the Val-de-Travers, the birthplace of absinthe. This region sits near the eastern border of France. Fritz opened the Blackmint Distillery in 1875, and received numerous awards and medals in competitions around the European theater before the Swiss government banned absinthe in 1910. In 2001, the Swiss ban was lifted and the brand was revived by Fritz's great grandson Yves (a fifth generation K√ºbler), who runs the distillery only a few miles from its original site in the Val-de-Travers. Crafting process The principal ingredients in K√ºbler Absinthe are the herbs grande wormwood (Artemisia absinthium) and anise. K√ºbler uses a grain neutral base spirit distilled from Swiss wheat and also includes hyssop, lemon balm, coriander, star anise, fennel, Roman wormwood and mint. All ingredients are analytically certified to the standards of the Swiss Expert Committee on the Unification of Pharmacopoeias. K√ºbler Absinthe is distilled using the same traditional method that has been used for over one hundred years. Following the initial maceration is a slow distillation process. Neither sugar nor artificial coloring is added to the finished distillate. The end product is an all- natural, genuine Swiss clear or 'La Bleue' absinthe, and is bottled at 106 proof (53% ABV). Family tradition J.F. K√ºbler, the patriarch of the family, started the K√ºbler Absinthe tradition (1863). It continued until the Swiss absinthe prohibition was enacted on October 7, 1910. On October 10, 2001, exactly 91 years and three days after the start of the Swiss prohibition, Yves K√ºbler's first objective was reached: the distillation and sale of his first 500 liters of K√ºbler absinthe in Europe. In March 2005, all federal Swiss absinthe laws were repealed, giving Yves the right to continue the tradition his great grandfather created. K√ºbler Absinthe is now available in many markets, including the United States.

Its visitor features include hiking trails, a nature center, children's camps, a gift shop, and picnic facilities. The forest is listed as a National Natural Landmark and a National Historic District. The forest includes hardwood deciduous forest, extensive floodplain, loess hills, and marshlands.  History  After settlement by Woodland culture Indians for a thousand years prior to the arrival of whites, the Lewis and Clark Expedition camped near or at the location of the forest on July 27, 1804. Joshua Pilcher founded a trading post near Fontenelle Forest's great marsh for the Missouri Fur Company in 1812. This was at the edge of territory of the Omaha and Otoe peoples. The French-American trader Lucien Fontenelle, from New Orleans, later bought the post from Pilcher, and it became known as Fontenelle's Post. With the declining fur trade, he sold the post to the federal government in 1832, which used it to house the Bellevue Indian Agency. After Fontenelle's death in 1840, his oldest son Logan Fontenelle returned to Nebraska from school in St. Louis. Tri-lingual and of mixed race, the younger Fontenelle started working at age 15 as an interpreter for the US Indian agent at the Agency. His mother was the daughter of the Omaha principal chief, Big Elk; and he spoke Omaha, English and French. The younger Fontenelle participated as interpreter in negotiations for the Omaha cession of land in its 1854 treaty with the United States, and many European Americans in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries thought he was a chief. In 1919 the historian Melvin R. Gilmore wrote an article explaining the Omaha patrilineal gente system, which he believed prohibited Fontenelle as a chief because of his American father, as he was never adopted into the tribe. Because Fontenelle's father was a white man, the Omaha classified him as also white. Melvin Randolph Gilmore, \\"The True Logan Fontenelle\\", Publications of the Nebraska State Historical Society, Vol. 19, edited by Albert Watkins, Nebraska State Historical Society, 1919, pp. 64-65, at GenNet, accessed 25 August 2011 Both father and son are buried in the forest, although the exact location is unknown. Dr. A.A. Tyler and Dr. Harold Gifford, Sr. founded the Fontenelle Forest Association in 1913 with a mission to preserve the woodlands south of Omaha, Nebraska along the Missouri River. They bought their first preservation land in 1920. The association named the forest after Logan Fontenelle. A small nature center was opened in 1966 for the popular educational hikes led by volunteers. In 2000, the Fontenelle Forest Association officially changed its name to Fontenelle Nature Association. In 2012, Fontenelle Nature Association changed its name back to Fontenelle Forest. Today, Fontenelle Forest keeps more than 2,000 acres of riparian forest, prairies, swamps, and other lands in preservation.

It was initially constructed in 1937 as part of a World War II coastal defence programme codenamed Chain Home. The site played an important role during the Second World War, providing early warnings of incoming bomber attacks carried out by the Luftwaffe. The site was also part of the ROTOR programme in the 1950s as a Centimetric Early Warning (CEM) station, keeping a constant watch for suspicious Soviet bombers. During the time, an extensive bunker complex was also built at the site, which would later be converted for use as a shelter in case of a nuclear strike during the Cold War. Most of the buildings and facilities at the site have since been demolished, with the bunkers now sealed shut following unauthorised access.  History = World War II  Following the development and introduction of early-warning radars during the mid 1930s in locations such as RAF Bawdsey and Orford Ness, the Air Ministry set out a programme of building a ring of coastal radar stations around the British coast to provide early warnings of air attacks, codenamed Chain Home (CH). Ventnor was one of 20 original Chain Home stations authorised in 1937 and became operational in October 1938 using experimental transmitters and receivers in temporary hutting. The site, like most Chain Home stations, was powered by the National Grid but had electric generators to cover for interruptions in the supply. The station subsequently went on 24-hour watch from early 1939 and was put on a war footing on 24 August 1939 in preparation for war. On 12 August 1940, four Chain Home stations were targeted for bombing by the Luftwaffe, including RAF Ventnor. The radar station suffered considerable damage with most of the buildings being damaged or destroyed. However, casualties were light with only one soldier being injured. Following this attack, a mobile installation were set up and remained in operation until the station was repaired. The site played an important role during Operation Overlord, the codename for D-Day, monitoring both ship and aircraft movements involved in the landings. From June 1944 onwards the station was active in detecting incoming German V-1 flying bombs. By November 1947, Ventnor was one of 26 radar stations still in use in the UK with the Type 24 long range microwave height finder and Types 52 and 53 radars still operational.  1950s‚Äì1960s  Following the threat from the Soviet atomic bomb project, the British Government set up a plan to introduce an air defence radar system to counter possible attacks by Soviet bombers, codenamed ROTOR. RAF Ventnor was chosen to participate in the programme. In the early 1950s, the site was re-activated as part of Phrase 1 of the ROTOR programme. The site (codenamed OJC) was operated by the No.23 Signals Unit under the control of the Ground Control Intercept (GCI) station RAF Sopley. In 1952 the site was remodelled as one of seven underground Centimetric Early Warning (CEM) station, designed to provide more accurate information on the height, range and size of an attacking force compared to the World War II Chain Home radar stations. The bunkers, made of ten feet thick reinforced concrete, housed RAF workers who kept a constant watch for any suspicious aircraft up to 300 miles away. Most of the radar operators and technical personnel working at Ventnor at the time were teenagers, serving their period of compulsory National Service. By the end of 1956, the AMES Type 80 had been added to the site. Ventnor remained operational until 1957 before being placed into care and maintenance.  1960s‚Äì1990s  The Royal Air Force decommissioned the site in 1961 and, from 1962, it was used by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) as a communications station. In the 1960s, the Linesman radar programme was established with the intention of combining military and civil aviation control, known as Linesman/Mediator. The programme refurbished and improved radar defences at Ventnor. Until the 1990s, the site was involved in the detection and interception of intruding Warsaw Pact aircraft, using the Marconi Type 264A radar and secondary surveillance radars. The operations bunker was refurbished as the Isle of Wight Council's Control Centre and remained in operation until 1991 as the Isle of Wight Emergency Command Centre for command and control of the island in-case of a nuclear attack.  Preservation  View of St Boniface Down (location of RAF Ventnor) in 2018 The guardhouse, air vents and emergency staircase of the bunker were demolished in 1991 and the bunker itself was eventually sealed shut in 2004 following unauthorised access. Some of the original features of the site are still present, such as mast bases. As of 2014, the central compound still remains and is in used by NATS for air traffic control with telecom masts owned by other companies also present. The surrounding land is in the care of the National Trust. The surviving components of the original 1938‚Äì1939 Chain Home radar station, such as the receiver building, the three receiver tower bases and any remains of the former station defences including a pillbox, is considered a Grade II listed building for their \\"architectural interest and degree of survival\\" and for their \\"historic interest (history of radars).\\" See also *List of former Royal Air Force stations ReferencesExternal links * Derelict Places ‚Äì RAF Ventnor R1 CEW ROTOR bunker Category:History of the Isle of Wight Category:Royal Air Force stations in Hampshire Category:Ventnor ","title":"RAF Ventnor"},{"id":"13435006","text":"Seyed Mohsen Mousavi is one of the four Iranian diplomats who disappeared in north Lebanon on July 4, 1982.

This caused some controversy within the diocese of Ottawa due to the ongoing debate in the Anglican Church regarding same-sex marriage.

The company has approximately 2,200 employees, of which 1,965 are employed offshore. Farstad Shipping focuses on large, advanced vessels in the anchor handling, supply and subsea segments. The company's operations are mainly concentrated on the markets in North- West Europe, Brazil and Indian Pacific, with offices in Norway, Scotland, Australia, Singapore and Brazil. The company is 46% owned by the Farstad family. Farstad Shipping has been listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange since 1988. In June 2017, Farstad Shipping merged with Deep Sea Supply and Solstad Offshore to create Solstad Farstad. History Farstad Shipping was founded as a traditional shipping company in 1956. The company was one of the first operators in the North Sea that decided to focus on offshore service vessels. In 1973 the company contracted its first supply vessel, an anchor handling vessel of the type UT 704. Until the mid-1980s the company grew through various forms of collaboration both with regard to ownership and operations. The acquisition of two service vessel fleets during the second half of the 80's were important events in the further development of the company. At the same time the company built independent operational and marketing functions. During this period, the ship owning part was gathered in one company. From 1990, renewal and growth of the fleet has largely taken place by selling older vessels and implementing a considerable newbuild programme. This growth has been founded in the Norwegian maritime cluster. Farstad Shipping's international presence increased significantly during the 2000s. Operations Farstad Shipping is currently among the six largest companies worldwide in the market for large and medium-sized supply vessels. About 63% of this world fleet is in North-West Europe, Brazil and Indian Pacific where the company's activities are mainly concentrated. Farstad Shipping has a market share measured in the number of vessels of about 6% in these markets. Farstad Shipping's fleet consists of the following vessel types: * Anchor handling tug supply vessels: Specially designed vessels for anchor handling and towing offshore platforms, barges and production modules/ vessels. * Platform supply vessels: Specially designed vessels for transporting supplies and equipment to and from offshore installations. These vessels transport general cargo, primarily in containers. * Subsea: Vessels specially designed for operations at great depths, installation and maintenance of seabed facilities.

These Minuets are among the best known pieces of music literature. The 1965 pop song \\"A Lover's Concerto\\", of which millions of copies were sold, is based on the first of these Minuets. History In the late 17th century Christian Petzold became organist at the () of Dresden. By the time Johann Sebastian Bach started to visit Dresden, Petzold was well acquainted with several of the city's musicians, including the violinist Johann Georg Pisendel, with whom Bach was also acquainted. In 1720, Petzold composed the music for the inauguration of the new Silbermann organ of the . Bach gave a concert on that organ when he visited Dresden in September 1725. Petzold died in 1733: as organist of the he was succeeded by Bach's son Wilhelm Friedemann. In the Notebook for Anna Magdalena Bach The second Notebook for Anna Magdalena Bach was started in 1725. It opened with two harpsichord suites, that is, the Partitas BWV 827 and 830, composed and written down by Johann Sebastian Bach. Anna Magdalena Bach likely received the notebook from her husband in the autumn of 1725, as a present for either her birthday (22 September) or their wedding anniversary (3 December). Nos. 3 to 11 in the notebook are keyboard pieces written down by Anna Magdalena, likely shortly after she was given the volume. No. 3, the first piece after the two seven-movement Partitas, is a Minuet in F major by an unknown composer (likely not Bach), adopted as No. 113 in the second annex (, Anh.), that is the annex of doubtful compositions, in the (BWV). Petzold's Minuets in G major and G minor, BWV Anh. 114 and 115, are the next two entries in the notebook (Nos. 4 and 5). These pieces may have been brought back from Dresden by Johann Sebastian when he visited this city in September 1725. Bach likely intended the simple binary dances contained in Anna Magdalena's notebooks, including the Minuets entered without composer indication, as teaching material, likely rather for his younger children than for his wife. Petzold's harpsichord music From the early 1720s Petzold owned a state-of-the-art harpsichord manufactured by Silbermann. In Johann Gottfried Walther's Lexicon, published in 1732, Petzold is mentioned as a composer of \\"good keyboard pieces\\" (). Some of Petzold's harpsichord music appeared in 1729 collections: * Georg Philipp Telemann included a harpsichord suite by Petzold in the last five issues of . * A collection of 25 concertos for unaccompanied harpsichord by Petzold was copied as . Heinrich Raphael Krause was a student in Leipzig from 1720, before becoming cantor in Olbernhau in 1725. Johann Benjamin Tzschirich was a student in Grimma when he started to copy harpsichord pieces collected by Krause in an album in 1726. Tzschirich came to study in Leipzig in 1729, and became a lawyer in Bitterfeld in 1736. Meanwhile he had continued to add pieces to his harpsichord music manuscript, including compositions by Bach (part of BWV 914), Friedrich Wilhelm Zachow, Telemann, Johann Kuhnau and others. One of the last pieces he entered, likely around the time when moving to Bitterfeld (1735‚Äì1736), was a Suite by Petzold containing, together with eight other movements, the G major/G minor combined Minuet, otherwise only known as Nos. 4 and 5 of Anna Magdalena Bach's second notebook. Tzschirich may have had access to a score of Petzold's Suite via the Bachs. Minuets In Tzschirich's manuscript, the Minuet pair in G major and G minor is preceded by five other movements of Petzold's Suite, respectively a Prelude, an Allemande, a Courante, a Sarabande and a Bourr√©e. After the double Minuet, Petzold's Suite continues with a Gigue and a Passepied with Trio. According to the manuscript, the Minuets are to be performed da capo, in this order: * (=first Minuet, G major) * (=second Minuet, G minor) * (repeat the first Minuet) Both the G major and the G minor Menuets, in time, consist of 32 measures, each with a repeat sign at the end of the 16th measure (for a repeat of the first half of the piece), and another at the end of the Menuet (for a repeat of the second half). There are a few minor differences between these Minuets as they appear in Tzschirich's manuscript and how they are written down in Anna Magdalena's second notebook.

F. Peters published Nos. 4 and 5 of Anna Magdalena Bach's second notebook as two of \\"twenty easy piano pieces\\" () from that manuscript. The Bach-Gesellschaft published the Minuets in 1894. After the publication of several anthologies, all the pieces of the second notebook were published in a single volume in 1904. In 1904, Max Seiffert published a description of Tzschirich's harpsichord music manuscript, however, without substantial analysis of its content: the correspondence of Petzold's double Minuet contained in it with the G major/G minor Minuets of Anna Magdalena Bach's notebook remained unnoticed. In the first edition of the , published in 1950, the two Minuets were included as doubtful compositions in Anh. II, along with nearly 20 other anonymous keyboard compositions of Anna Magdalena Bach's second notebook (BWV Anh. II 113‚Äì132). In 1957, Anna Magdalena's notebooks were published in Vol. V/4 of the New Bach Edition. Without having access to other primary sources for the G major and G minor Minuets than Anna Magdalena Bach's notebook, Georg von Dadelsen, the editor of the New Bach Edition volume, remarked that the Minuets and 115 appeared to belong together. Outside the context of scholarly literature, and despite being marked as doubtful in the BWV, the Minuets were still generally considered as compositions by Bach. The melody from the 1965 pop song \\"A Lover's Concerto\\", written by American songwriters Sandy Linzer and Denny Randell, was based on the Minuet in G major. The song was recorded by The Toys and reached number 2 in the US Billboard Hot 100 and number 5 in the UK Singles Chart. \\"A Lover's Concerto\\" sold more than two million copies and was awarded gold record certification by the R.I.A.A. Hans-Joachim Schulze published an article, dedicated to Georg von Dadelsen, in the of 1979 (issued 1980), in which he described Petzold's (harpsichord suite) contained in Tzschirich's manuscript, and its Minuet pair corresponding to BWV Anh. 114/115. Consequently, from the next edition of the (1990), the Minuets were attributed to Petzold and moved from Anh. II to Anh. III, that is the of spurious works, their full BWV numbers thus becoming and . In the 1984 film Electric Dreams, the piece is the basis for a duet, or a friendly musical duel, between cellist Madeline and Edgar, the computer. This song from the movie soundtrack, titled \\"The Duel,\\" was composed and performed by Giorgio Moroder. Notwithstanding their status as pieces for beginners, the Minuets and 115 were recorded by renowned performers (on harpsichord unless otherwise indicated), including:Johann Sebastian Bach: Solo Keyboard at ArkivMusic website. * Gustav Leonhardt recorded \\"2 Minuets ...

The 1995 film Mr. Holland's Opus has a scene in which the title character, a high school music teacher, explains to his students the connection between \\"A Lover's Concerto\\" and the Minuet in G major. He incorrectly identifies the piece as written by Bach, which is appropriate given the scene is set in 1965 when the public still believed the tune to be written by Bach.

Leyhill Prison is operated by Her Majesty's Prison Service. History Leyhill Prison was originally a United States military hospital built for the Second World War. The site was converted into a prison in 1946, with inmates originally being housed in hutted accommodation. The prison was rebuilt in the late 1970s to early 1980s, and in 1986 prisoners were re-housed in new living accommodation. In 2002 new accommodation units were added to increase the prison's capacity. In a March 2002 report, Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons criticised Leyhill for failing to prepare inmates for release, stating that too little was being done to help inmates get ready for the pressures of life outside. The report also claimed that staff had no clear idea of their role at the prison. In May 2006, it was revealed that more than one inmate a week was escaping from Leyhill Prison, although technically inmates cannot escape, only abscond from an open prison. Statistics showed that 66 prisoners had walked out of Leyhill in the 2005/06 financial year. The Prison Service claimed the number of escapes was down to population pressures in the UK prison estate, with less trustworthy prisoners being transferred to open prisons like Leyhill. The prison today Leyhill is a prison for adult male prisoners of Category D status, meaning that either a Parole Board or the Prison Service has deemed them suitable for Open conditions. At the time of the last inspection in September 2016, more than 60% of the prisoners at Leyhill were convicted Sex Offenders, and the prison were planning to increase this to around 90% by June 2017. Leyhill was strongly criticised for failing to properly manage the risks posed by this population, and not assisting enough with effective resettlement. Leyhill runs a variety of courses designed to help prisoners prepare for release. These include a general joinery woodwork shop (offering City & Guilds qualifications in Woodwork); a printing shop; a commercial laundry; Industrial Cleaning and Car-Valeting training; Waste Management and Recycling training; and Forklift truck and Tractor Training. The prison's farms and gardens also provide work and training for prisoners on a 55-hectare estate, including extensive ornamental grounds. There is a nationally important arboretum run in conjunction with the Forestry Commission; it is often open to the public. As an open prison a number of prisoners at Leyhill are placed in the community to complete work and training placements. These placements are designed with the focus of improving a prisoner's chance of successful resettlement in the community on release.

The son of an Irish-American saloonkeeper, Egan was born and raised in the Kerry Patch, then known as the riverfront Irish ghetto of St. Louis. With some of his childhood pals, he began running with a local gang of thugs, known as the Ashley Street Gang. Egan's best friend, Thomas \\"Snake\\" Kinney, was a local street tough and Democratic politician. During an ill-fated burglary attempt on October 17, 1894, Egan was shot through the face by a policeman. Tom survived but was left with an ugly scar on his jaw. Throughout the years, his stock in the gang climbed. By 1904, when Snake Kinney was elected to the Missouri State Senate, Tom Egan had taken over leadership of the street gang.

In one famous sentence, Egan boasted, \\"...we don't shoot unless we know who is present,\\" sounding eerily like Bugsy Siegel saying forty years later, \\"We only kill each other.\\" Knowing that the up-and-coming Prohibition movement would become the law of the land, Tom Egan set up a liquor smuggling network as early as the mid-1910s. In January 1916, Egan's saloon headquarters at Broadway and Carr streets was padlocked by police after one of the original Egan's Rats, William \\"Skippy\\" Rohan, was shot dead on the premises. Despite this, Tom Egan remained on top of the St. Louis underworld until he was diagnosed with Bright's Disease in late 1918. Egan died at the age of 44 on April 20, 1919. Tom's younger brother William took over leadership of the Egan's Rats. ReferencesFurther reading *Waugh, Daniel.

The park features walking and hiking trails, nature center, picnic and recreation areas, a lodge, and cross-country skiing and sledding. The park is the location of an annual Fourth of July celebration, which includes a concert by the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra. History The site for the park was originally owned by John Merryman during the 1800s. The park was built on the site of some abandoned Goethite (iron ore) and marble quarries dating back to the 1830s. One of the quarries has long since filled with water. It was then used for many years for swimming, with an added sand beach. The park was previously used for downhill skiing in the 1960s, but warmer temperatures in the region and the cost of artificially producing snow made this usage impractical. Remnants of the lifts are still present, and the main slope is used as a seating area for outdoor concerts. In 1990, the park acquired the Merryman Tract, which includes the valley of the Baisman Run, expanding to the south of the original park area.

The sexes are similar in appearance with the upper parts being rufous and the head and underparts being bluish-grey. It is native to central Africa where it is found in the understorey of forests. Taxonomy and systematics Its name commemorates the American ornithologist George Latimer Bates. Bates's paradise flycatcher was formerly considered as a subspecies of the rufous-vented paradise flycatcher but is now recognized as a separate species. An alternate name is the Cameroon rufous-vented paradise-flycatcher. Subspecies There are two subspecies recognized: * T. b. batesi ‚Äì Chapin, 1921: Found from southern Cameroon and Gabon to eastern Democratic Republic of Congo * Bannerman's paradise- flycatcher (T. b. bannermani) ‚Äì Chapin, 1948: Formerly considered by some authorities as a separate species. Found in Congo, southwestern Democratic Republic of Congo and northern Angola Description Bates's paradise flycatcher is usually 18 centimetres long but males in parts of Cameroon and Angola have elongated central tail-feathers making them 23-28 centimetres long. The head and underparts are blue-grey while the upperparts are rufous. The sexes are similar in coloration. The song is a series of ringing \\"tswee\\" notes. The rufous-vented paradise flycatcher is similar in appearance but has a darker head with a crest and males always have elongated central tail- feathers.

In modern electronic terms, a low tension coil is simply a large inductor, an electrical device that stores energy for brief periods. The term \\"low tension\\" was the terminology of the day used to differentiate it from the term \\"high tension\\", and generally meant \\"low voltage\\" (tension) as opposed to \\"high voltage\\" (tension). High tension coils produce high voltages, generally meant to produce a spark across a spark plug. Construction A low tension coil consists of an iron core that has wire wrapped around it. The size of the iron core, the number of turns of wire, and the size of the wire determine the electrical properties of the coil. Terminals are provided to connect the coil into the ignition circuit. The wood ends are provided for mechanical stability, to provide for the terminal placement and to hold the wire on the coil over time. A cloth or tape covering is provided to protect the windings. The iron core should be a bundle of thinly insulated iron wires, or flat thin sheets like those in a transformer, to prevent losses and heating from current that would be induced in a solid rod. Use A low tension coil for engine ignition is used in conjunction with a battery and an ignitor. The ignitor is no more than a set of contacts that reside inside the combustion chamber of the engine. A series circuit is made between the three components: battery connects to coil, second terminal on the coil connects to the ignitor, second terminal on the ignitor (usually connected electrically and mechanically to the engine itself) connects to the second terminal of the battery.  Multi- cylinder engines  Multi-cylinder engine, with individual coils for each cylinder The low tension coil system was also used for multi-cylinder engines, although rarely, as it required a separate coil for each cylinder. Theory of Operation An inductor attempts to maintain a constant current flow through it. If the current in the circuit in which the inductor is connected goes down for some reason, the voltage developed across the inductor will go up in an attempt to try to maintain the constant current. When used with an ignitor ignition system in an engine, there is current flow when the ignitor contacts are closed. When the ignitor contacts are opened by the mechanical parts of the engine, current flow is interrupted. Because the low tension coil wants to maintain that current flow, the voltage across the coil rapidly goes up (usually to several hundred volts). When the voltage rises high enough, the voltage will jump the still very small gap of the ignitor contacts and create a spark which ignites the fuel mixture in the engine. Since there is a finite amount of energy stored in the coil, as soon as the spark jumps the gap the voltage across the coil collapses. As soon as the engine rotates and the ignitor contacts again close, current starts to flow through the coil and it again stores energy for the next cycle.

Colombia also has a national music industry. Many of the media are controlled by large for-profit corporations who reap revenue from advertising, subscriptions, and sale of copyrighted material, largely affected by piracy. Media in Colombia is regulated by the Ministry of Communications and the National Television Commission. Many deregulation and convergence have occurred in an attempt by the government to turn the mass media industry in Colombia more competitive, leading to mega-mergers, further concentration of media ownership, and the emergence of multinational media conglomerates. Critics allege that localism, local news and other content at the community level, media spending and coverage of news, and diversity of ownership and views have suffered as a result of these processes of media concentration. In 2015 Colombia ranked 128th place on the Reporters Without Borders press freedom scale, making it one of the most dangerous places to be a mass media journalist. Newspapers The first newspaper published in Colombia was La Bagatela, edited by Antonio Nari√±o in 1811. Newspaper media in Colombia date back to the Spanish colonization of the Americas. The first newspaper published in Colombia was La Bagatela, edited by Antonio Nari√±o in 1811. In Colombia the most read and influential newspaper is El Tiempo, which also has the highest newspaper circulation in the country. It was founded in 1911 by Alfonso Villegas Restrepo and currently owned by Luis Carlos Sarmiento Angulo. Another influential newspaper is El Espectador, founded in 1887 by Fidel Cano Guti√©rrez, was for many years one of the most important dailies in Colombia but due to a financial crisis its circulation was restricted to one edition weekly between 2001 and 2008, when it returned as a daily. El Nuevo Siglo, a conservative newspaper, focuses on political news. El Espacio, founded in 1965 by Ciro G√≥mez Mej√≠a, was the main yellow journalism newspaper in the country until 2013 when it was sold to Roberto Esper Espaje after it could not cope with the competence of fledgling tabloids Q'Hubo and Extra. El Tiempo and El Espectador are the only newspapers of national distribution. Free newspapers include Publimetro (Bogot√°, Medell√≠n, Cali, and Barranquilla) and ADN, published by El Tiempo in the same cities mentioned plus Bucaramanga. El Pa√≠s newspaper is the main source of written information in the south-western region of the country, specially in the Valle del Cauca department. El Colombiano newspaper, based in Medell√≠n, is the most influential newspaper in the Paisa Region.

Media ownership Media ownership remains concentrated in the hands of wealthy families, large national conglomerates, or groups associated with one or the other of the two dominant political parties. The first foreign media owner in the country is the Spanish media conglomerate Prisa, which acquired majority ownership of the country's largest radio network. There are public television and radio networks and two news agencies (Ciep‚ÄìEl Pa√≠s and Colprensa). Freedom of the press The law provides for freedom of speech and of the press, and the government generally has respected these rights in practice. Although security forces generally have not subjected journalists to harassment, intimidation, or violence, there have been exceptions, as well as reports of threats and violence against journalists by corrupt officials. Colombian journalists practice self-censorship to avoid reprisals by corrupt officials, criminals, and members of illegal armed groups. In the fifth annual Reporters Without Borders Worldwide Press Freedom Index published in October 2006, Colombia ranked 131 of a total of 168 countries, a decline from its 2005 ranking of 128. More than 80 journalists have been murdered in the past decade for doing their jobs. Major international wire services, newspapers, and television networks have a presence in the country and generally operate free of government interference.

Little is known about it. It was already defunct before 1766. Context In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the course of study at Yale was drastically different from what it is now. The majority of literature studied was that of the ancient Greeks, Romans, and, in the extensive study of the Old Testament, Hebrews. English literature was not introduced into the curriculum until the 1850s. The young men who studied at Yale at the time felt the need to supplement their studies with a working knowledge of contemporary literature and a forum in which to gain ‚Äúskill in making known [their] own thoughts in good, plain English‚Äù . The literary societies, which first appeared at Yale and soon afterward at many other colleges and universities, were designed to fill this void. Unlike other societies, students of any class from freshmen to seniors could be members of the literary societies; in fact, by the end of the eighteenth century, everyone at Yale belonged to one and there was often fierce competition for the recruitment of freshmen. Activities These societies were primarily debating societies, but they also held speeches and poetry readings and each had a substantial library, filled with books that one could not find in Yale College‚Äôs collection. Only the members of a given society had access to its library, and debates primarily took place within the society, though by the mid-1800s it was not unheard of for a speech to be attended by members of all three societies, or for inter-society debates to be organized. At the end of the Civil War, the Yale College faculty attempted to ban fraternities and sophomore societies. As a cover for their continued existence, many of these groups took the guise of small debating societies. Linonia and Brothers in Unity no longer dominated the College‚Äôs social scene, and the Yale Union became the primary forum for debate. In 1872, Linonia and Brothers in Unity gave up their libraries to the College‚Äôs collection and were wholly absorbed by the Union, which enjoyed intermittent existence until 1934 when it became the Yale Political Union.

Long Bridge connected Washington, D.C. to Northern Virginia and served as a vital transportation artery for the Union Army during the war. Fort Jackson was named for Jackson City, a seedy suburb of Washington that had been established on the south side of the Long Bridge in 1835. It was built in the days immediately following the Union Army's occupation of Northern Virginia in May 1861. The fort was initially armed with four cannon used to protect the bridge, but these were removed after the completion of the Arlington Line, a line of defenses built to the south. After 1862, the fort lacked weapons except for small arms and consisted of a wooden palisade backed by earthworks. Two cannon were restored to the fort in 1864 following the Battle of Fort Stevens. The garrison consisted of a single company of Union soldiers who inspected traffic crossing the bridge and guarded it from potential saboteurs. Following the final surrender of the Confederate States of America in 1865, Fort Jackson was abandoned. The lumber used in its construction was promptly salvaged for firewood and construction materials and, due to its proximity to the Long Bridge, the earthworks were flattened in order to provide easier access to Long Bridge. In the early 20th century, the fort's site was used for the footings and approaches to several bridges connecting Virginia and Washington. Today, no trace of the fort remains, though the site of the fort is contained within Arlington County's Long Bridge Park, and a National Park Service 2004 survey of the site indicated some archaeological remnants may still remain beneath the park.  Occupation of Arlington  Before the outbreak of the Civil War, Alexandria County (renamed Arlington County in 1920), the county in Virginia closest to Washington, D.C., was a predominantly rural area.

Most of the county is hilly, and at the time, most of the county's population was concentrated in the city of Alexandria, at the far southeastern corner of the county.

On May 23, 1861, Virginia voted by a margin of 3 to 1 in favor of leaving the Union. That night, U.S. Army troops began crossing the bridges linking Washington, D.C. to Virginia. The march, which began at 10 p.m. on the night of the 23rd, was described in colorful terms by the New York Herald two days later: Union soldiers cross the Long Bridge during the occupation of northern Virginia following that state's secession from the Union. The occupation of Northern Virginia was peaceful, with the exception of the town of Alexandria. There, as Colonel Elmer E. Ellsworth, commander of the New York Fire Zouaves (11th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment), entered a local hotel to remove the Confederate flag flying above it, he was shot and killed by James Jackson, the proprietor. Ellsworth was one of the first men killed in the American Civil War.Ames W. Williams, \\"The Occupation of Alexandria,\\" Virginia Cavalcade, Volume 11, (Winter 1961-62), pp. 33-34.

Barnard accompanied the army and began building fortifications and entrenchments along the banks of the Potomac River in order to defend the bridges that crossed it.Cooling, 1991, p. 37. By sunrise on the morning of the 24th, ground had already been broken on the first two forts comprising the Civil War defenses of Washington ‚Äî Fort Runyon and Fort Corcoran. Within a week, other, smaller forts had sprung up as supporting works. Fort Jackson, built to the northeast of Fort Runyon about fifty yards south of the intersection of the present-day 14th Street Bridge and the Virginia shore and armed with four cannon, was one of these. Owing to its large physical size and extensive armament, Fort Runyon was intended to be the primary fort defending the Long Bridge. Fort Jackson, located at the southern end of the bridge, received four cannon and was intended as a guard post for soldiers inspecting civilian traffic crossing the bridge and to detour any Confederate saboteurs that might attempt to destroy the bridge.Military-use Structures, \\"Fort Runyon\\" Arlington (Va.)

Following the completion of the Arlington Line, which was built several miles to the southwest of Fort Jackson, atop the heights of Arlington, the maintenance of Forts Jackson and Runyon was neglected. The two forts had largely been made redundant by the newer, stronger works atop the hills, and it was believed that neither played a crucial role any longer in the defenses of Washington. Fort Jackson was kept in service only as an inspection station for traffic crossing Long Bridge.Williams, Duane J. Civil War Diaries. iUniverse, 2002. Page 27.  Railroad and rebuilding  In 1863, a new railroad bridge was constructed adjacent to the Long Bridge as part of a plan to strengthen the logistics of the Army of the Potomac as it operated in northern Virginia. An extension of the Orange and Alexandria Railroad, the bridge would be used until the turn of the century before being replaced. Owing to the weight of the railroad and the weak strength of the bridge, no locomotives were allowed on the bridge. Prior to crossing the Potomac, the train would detach its locomotive and be pulled across the bridge by a team of horses.Norfolk Southern Railway History, \\"Orange and Alexandria Railroad\\" Piedmont Railroaders, Spring 2002. Accessed June 19, 2008. In order to provide space for the railroad tracks, the gates of Fort Jackson had to be removed. These were eventually replaced, but the wide opening needed for the tracks proved to have a detrimental effect on the fort's defensive ability.List of Virginia Forts, \\"Fort Jackson\\" Pete Payette and Phil Payette. November 17, 2007. Accessed June 19, 2008. An 1864 report by Lt. Col. Barton S. Alexander, the aide de camp to Gen. John Gross Barnard, chief engineer of the defenses of Washington, described the way Fort Jackson had been allowed to fall into disrepair: To fix the problems at Fort Jackson, Alexander recommended the addition of an artillery section, a second company of infantry, and various improvements to the fort itself. Spurred in part by the Confederate attack on Fort Stevens north of Washington, several improvements were made, including the restoration of gates that had been removed when the railroad line was constructed. Gen. Christopher Columbus Augur, commander of the Department of Washington, recommended that Fort Jackson be assigned two light guns as armament during the reconstruction.Scott, et al., Volume 37 (Part 2), Chapter 49, Page 495.  Post-war use  A map of the site of Fort Jackson as it exists today. The George Washington Memorial Parkway is the roadway to the south of the site of Fort Jackson, which is shaded in red. The CSX railroad bridge runs directly through the site. After the surrender of General Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia on April 9, 1865, the primary reason for manned defenses protecting Washington ceased to exist. Initial recommendations by Colonel Barton S. Alexander, then-chief engineer of the Washington defenses, were to divide the defenses into three classes: those that should be kept active (first-class), those that should be mothballed and kept in a reserve state (second-class), and those that should be abandoned entirely (third-class). Due to its rear-area nature and the fact that inspections were no longer needed to protect the Long Bridge against sabotage, Fort Jackson fell into the third- class category.Scott, et al., Volume 46 (Serial 97) , Part 3, p. 1130. The lumber used in the construction of Fort Jackson was either sold for salvage or scavenged by squatters, most of whom were freed slaves traveling north in a search for new lives following the ending of slavery in the United States. Many settled in the area of the former Fort Runyon, and it seems likely that the lumber of Fort Jackson would have been a ready source of firewood. By the turn of the century, the site of Fort Jackson had become the footings for a new railroad bridge, constructed in 1903. Three years later, a road bridge was constructed just to the west.14th Street Bridge Scott M. Kozel, Roadstothefuture.com. June 20, 2004. Accessed June 19, 2008.

Richardson is most famous for developing the Merry Hill Shopping Centre in Brierley Hill, West Midlands, England. He was born just a few streets away from the Round Oak Steel Works that once occupied part of the huge Merry Hill site, and when the steel works closed in December 1982 (with the loss of more than 1,000 jobs), the Richardsons set about revamping the site. By 1985, barely two years after the closure of Round Oak, the Richardsons had already constructed the first two phases of the Merry Hill development - part of an enterprise zone that would be free of rates for 10 years under government initiatives to regenerate areas plagued with high levels of unemployment due to a decline in the manufacturing industry. By 1989, the Richardsons had created one of Europe's largest shopping centres, which also incorporated fast food outlets, a cinema and a petrol station. They officially opened the final phase of the complex on 14 November 1989. Mr Richardson died of cancer in September 2007 at the age of 77. He was survived by his wife Ann and his brother Roy.

After graduating from high school, he went to work for an uncle who owned several auto supply stores. Gallen ran his own store before serving in the army, where he was still involved in the auto parts business during World War II. Because of wartime restrictions, fabric became difficult to acquire and he recognized a chance to take advantage of connections to move into the apparel industry. In 1949, he founded Ellen Tracy, manufacturing women's blouses in New York and selling them for $28.50 a dozen to department stores. Initially, Gallen produced several sample blouses using fabric obtained from a friend, which he then took to major department stores in Manhattan. He visited Franklin Simon & Co., which immediately purchased every blouse he had. The label had a showroom and stockroom on Third Avenue.

It was built for the Swiss Federal Railways (SBB-CFF-FFS) by Brown, Boveri & Cie (BBC) in 1938 and used for experimental services on non-electrified lines. History BBC had first built a gas turbine generator set for the production of electric energy in 1938. An emergency power supply in an underground bunker for the city of Neuch√¢tel, providing 4000 kW of electricity, was also built based on the same technology. BBC evaluated whether it would make sense to use a gas turbine to power a locomotive and filed a proposal to the Swiss Federal Railways for a gas turbine-electric locomotive with a power of The SBB-CFF-FFS were ready to accept the proposal under some conditions and thus offered the possibility to try applying the gas turbine technology to railways. The concept of a six-axle locomotive did not permit the application of more than 1620 kW of traction power. Top speed was set to . The weight (including fuel) must have not exceeded 92 tonnes, otherwise the SBB-CFF-FFS would have denied even trial runs. On the other hand, the SBB-CFF-FFS were obligated to take the locomotive into service upon its completion. The project was led and financed by BBC, while the Swiss Locomotive and Machine Works (SLM) built the mechanical parts. Technology=Construction The locomotive was based on existing technology wherever possible to avoid failures of components not directly associated with the gas turbine from endangering the project. The electric power transmission was chosen because it showed its reliability in conjunction with conventional diesel engines and because it allowed as many axles as desired to be driven, which was an important aspect because the weight per power output was much lower compared to diesel and steam engines of the time. A possible alternative would have been a hydraulic transmission, but this technology was not yet considered ready for powers above about . The turbine consisted of an air compressor, a combustion chamber and the turbine itself. The air compressor needed about to push the air into the combustion chamber (air pressures of , depending on the turbine rotation speed), where the fuel was injected and burnt, leading to an expansion of the gases, which, with a temperature of to , hit the turbine and produced about . The exhaust gases flowed through the heat exchanger, where they preheated the incoming air, and were ejected via the roof. The remaining power of about was used to drive the locomotive. Efficiency Measurements showed the efficiency of the turbine to rise steadily from idle (0% efficiency) to medium load (15% at ), reaching its top at high load (18% at ) and going down again towards maximum power output (16% at ); note that these numbers do not include losses of the electrical power transmission. This is low compared to conventional diesel engines and is one of the main reasons that prevented the wide adoption of this technology. Starting the locomotive First, an auxiliary diesel engine was started by the help of batteries. This engine was coupled to a generator which, in turn, provided electricity to start the turbine. The turbine was brought up to speed by the attached generator, which was now used as a motor. This process took about 4 minutes; then the turbine could be ignited and would then run by itself. While the turbine continued to speed up, the electricity produced by the auxiliary diesel engine could now be used to shunt the locomotive in front of its train at low speeds (). After another four minutes, the turbine had reached its idle speed (100 rpm at the generator). The locomotive was now operational. Increasing the power output To increase the power output, the engineer turned his power controller, which had the following effects: * More fuel was injected into the combustion chamber * The speed governor was adjusted to achieve a higher rotation speed * The overload protector noticed an overload situation (rotation speed lower than the target speed) and lowered (!) the load on the turbine Because of the lower load and the more fuel being injected, the rotation speed increased (up to 300 rpm at the generator under full load) and at some point the turbine reached its target speed, where the load was increased again up to the desired level to reach a new equilibrium between the turbine's power output and the power needed by the traction motors. To decrease the load, the same processes happened in the opposite direction. Braking To avoid using the air brakes during long descends (they wear out and tend to overheat), an alternative braking system is desirable. Since the compressor of the turbine needed up to 4,500 kW, it was planned to use it to convert electricity generated by the traction motors into heat, by shutting down the oil supply to the combustion chamber such that the turbine generated no more power. It is unclear whether the necessary installations were ever made. Safety measures If the engineer had increased the power output of the turbine too late (say within a grade instead before it), then the rotation speed of the turbine might not have risen fast enough, too much fuel might have burnt and the turbine might have overheated. A temperature too high was shown to the driver by a warning lamp; if he did not decrease the load, the fuel supply was cut after another rise of the temperature by 30 ¬∞C (54 ¬∞F). It might also have happened that a broken cable or fuse suddenly cut off the load from the turbine, leading to a rapid rise of its rotation speed that could not be compensated by the speed governor. In this case a safety device would have decreased the air supply to the turbine, leading to a rise of temperature in the combustion chamber due to the lack of cold air which, in turn, would have led to the shutdown of the turbine due to over-temperature. The combustion chamber was also monitored. If the temperature became too low (the oil did not burn any more), the controller would have tried to ignite the oil again and shut down the oil supply if this failed for 5 seconds. Controller logic The logic to control the turbine was implemented using oil. All inputs (speed governor, power controller, ...) were valves or pumps attached to an oil cycle and influenced the oil flow such that actuators (pistons) made the necessary regulations. Operation The locomotive was in use until 1958, when it was rebuilt for experiments with new electrical systems. It never made it into series production because of its relative inefficiency and, by 1958, the lack of non-electrified lines in the SBB-CFF-FFS network. The locomotive was tested in Germany as a potential replacement for the class 01 steam engines (which it outperformed especially on grades). Similar tests were made in France.

Acrylic glass can be molded into a variety of forms, and corporations will often create custom promotional items shaped like their products. They are manufactured by pouring acrylic casting resin into a mold. Embedments are acrylic trophies that have an item embedded into the resin. Many materials can be placed in an embedment ‚Äì paper, metal, acetate sheets, etc. This creates the effect of an item floating within the acrylic statue. These trophies are commonly made from Lucite, a branded form of acrylic developed by DuPont. One of the earliest uses of Lucite was in windshields for fighter planes during World War II.\\"Another Wall Street Casualty: The Art of the ‚ÄòDeal Toy‚Äô\\", Ianthe Jeanne Dugan. Published: February 11, 2009.The Wall Street Journal Following the war, DuPont promoted various consumer applications of Lucite, including its use in lamps, beer taps, hairbrushes, and jewelry. By virtue of its versatility, Lucite opened up a range of possible design options for deal toys and trophies, often resulting in keen competition among investment banks for the most creative and sophisticated pieces. Acrylic trophies can be manufactured in a variety of shapes, colors and sizes. The most common styles are clear rectangular ‚ÄúBillboards‚Äù, star shapes, circles, and pyramids. These are often engraved with corporate logos and personalized with the name of the recipient. They are also used in awards ceremonies for many organizations. Deal toys are acrylic trophies used in the financial industry in recognition of sales achievements.

Depending on the social context, many or the vast majority of arbitrarily arrested individuals may be held incommunicado and their whereabouts can be concealed from their family, associates, the public population and open trial courts. Many individuals who are arbitrarily arrested and detained suffer physical or psychological torture during interrogation, as well as extrajudicial punishment and other abuses in the hands of those detaining them.

This entertainment district was located in an area close to the intersection of Olive and Boyle Streets, near the eastern part of what is now known as the Central West End neighborhood and close to the current Grand Center arts and theater district and the adjoining Midtown neighborhood. History Gaslight Square was the name given to the entertainment district built in the mid-1950s. The district was known for its gas lit street lamps and ornate Victorian style architecture, reflective of the 1800s and the riverboat era around the turn of the century. Gaslight Square quickly became a thriving entertainment district that could be compared somewhat to the Delmar Loop area of St. Louis today. The Square occupies the area surrounding Olive and Boyle Streets in the Central West End. The district was popular for music, poetry, comedy, formal and informal dining, and dancing. It was the home to many clubs and restaurants, and entertainment venues. Brothers Dick and Paul Mutrux are considered by many to be the pioneers of Gaslight Square, being proprietors of one of the first saloons in the area, the Gaslight. Another saloon, the Golden Eagle, soon opened, and proprietor Jay Landesman relocated his extremely popular cabaret theatre, the Crystal Palace, to the area as well. Early business owners in Gaslight Square raided recently demolished property in downtown St. Louis to salvage unique items such as church pews, chandeliers, recycled stained glass, and marble bathtubs. These resourceful decorations gave Gaslight Square a youthful, eclectic feel that attracted young beatniks and wealthy customers alike. At its height, Gaslight Square was home to approximately fifty businesses, including taverns, cabarets, restaurants, sidewalk cafes, and antique shops. These businesses provided an array of unique entertainment that combined elements of the past and present. The Opera House had a fa√ßade covered in croquet balls and was a venue for Dixieland jazz. The Roaring Twenties was a speakeasy themed bar that included a stage show, mock raids, and staged gangster fights. The Natchez Queen was decorated to resemble a riverboat with live ragtime music inside. Mr.D's, highlighted a Piano Bar featuring Ceil Clayton where many of the Gaslight musicians would come and sing along. By 1962, property values had tripled in Gaslight Square. The district was greatly affected by dramatic change in culture and music of the late 1950s and 60s when the bohemian and later hippie generation began questioning traditional majority values in art, literature, and political self-expression. The district attracted many poets and writers, such as Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg who would stop in St. Louis to experience Gaslight Square. Many entertainers such as The Smothers Brothers, Lenny Bruce, Miles Davis, Barbra Streisand, Jackie Mason, Mike Nichols and Elaine May, Woody Allen, Jerry Stiller, Dick Gregory and Jack E. Leonard gained exposure at the start of their careers in the clubs of Gaslight Square. Even rockers played Gaslight Square.

Most of them of are still in use. By the late 1990s most of the buildings were long gone; those that remained stood open and rapidly deteriorating. For the 20‚Äì30 years the district was almost completely vacant, with many empty lots and the remaining building dilapidated and empty. In 2005, many properties within Gaslight Square were bought by the development company RJK Inc. 150 units were planned, mostly condominia. The new residential properties were meant to sell in the 280k-600k price-range. As of 2008, the vacant lots and condemned buildings are no more.

The first major auction by Heritage Auctions was scheduled to be held in conjunction with the convention. There were several factors, including a sharp drop in domestic travel after 9/11, that led to cancellation of the event roughly two weeks before the second convention was to occur but organizers publicly blamed slow dealer tables sales and their failure to meet room block commitments resulting in a $60,000 invoice from the hotel.

A member of Virginia's Lee family, he was part of the Fremont Expedition and commanded troops during the Cayuse War in what became the Oregon Territory. He also was a member of the Oregon Provisional Government and the second editor of the Oregon Spectator. Early life Lee was born in Virginia, circa 1818.Corning, Howard M.

During the expedition he was sent with a note to Kit Carson ordering Carson to catch up to the group, and later when the party split into two Lee remained with Fremont before returning to Oregon on September 22. Oregon Country Fellow pioneer John Minto described Lee as a \\"natural leader,\\" but contrasted his stile with that of James Nesmith; Lee, he contended, was less domineering than Nesmith, and attracted young men eager to serve. After settling in Oregon, Lee was elected to the Provisional Legislature of Oregon in 1845.Oregon Legislative Assembly (1st Provisional) 1845 Regular Session He represented the Clackamas District and served as Speaker of the body for part of the December session. In 1846, Lee became the second editor of the Oregon Spectator, the first newspaper in the region. He replaced William G. T'Vault and would remain editor for nine issues of the paper before George Law Curry took over the position. Cayuse War On November 29, 1847, the Whitman Mission near present day Walla Walla, Washington, was attacked by members of the Cayuse tribe in the Whitman Massacre. This led to further violence in the ensuing Cayuse War prosecuted by the Provisional Government of Oregon and later the United States government against the Native Americans in what became the Oregon Territory in 1848. In December 1847 when word of the attack reached the Willamette Valley, the Provisional Government and Gov. George Abernethy called for volunteers to fight against the Cayuse, with Lee volunteering and being selected as captain of a 50-man unit to be dispatched immediately to The Dalles. The Oregon Rifles under the command of Lee formed on December 8, and gathered at Fort Vancouver on December 10 where they purchased supplies from the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) post.Fagan, David D. 1885.

While preparation were made for war, the Provisional Government also attempted to negotiate with the Cayuse and other tribes. Lee was appointed as one of the peace commissioners, along with Joel Palmer and Robert Newell to seek a truce with the Cayuse and demand they turn over the killers from the massacre at the start of hostilities.Oregon Blue Book: Oregon History: Cayuse Indian War. Oregon Secretary of State, accessed September 25, 2007. Lee and his troops, with John E. Ross and Joseph Magone as lieutenants, then marched off to The Dalles, arriving on December 21. Upon arriving there, Lee led his men against a band of Native Americans and drove them off, but not before they stole 300 head of cattle. There the troops built a stockade and named the post Fort Lee for the commander, though the small fortification was also called Fort Wascopam. Lee's forces continued defending the Wascopam Mission and settlers until Colonel Cornelius Gilliam arrived with a larger force in February 1848, at which point Lee became third in command after Gilliam and Lieutenant-Colonel James Waters. With a larger force, the militia forces pressed east towards the Whitman Mission, with Lee commanding some troops and carrying out reconnaissance. By March 4 the forces reached the mission after a battle at Sand Hollows. After reaching the mission, Gilliam set out for The Dalles with a small force to supply that settlement, before continuing to Oregon City to report to the governor when he was accidentally shot and killed. Lee continued west with Gilliam's body and was promoted to Colonel before returning to the front. Once at the front he discovered that the troops had elected Waters as Colonel, so Lee resigned as colonel and took the role as a subordinate to Waters. Later life After leaving the war, Governor Abernethy appointed Lee as superintendent of Indian Affairs in 1848. In 1849, he sought his fortune in the gold mines of the California Gold Rush. He successfully mined there before returning to Oregon and setting up business in Oregon City in 1850. That year Lee traveled by ship to New York to acquire inventory for his store, but died of Panama fever on his return to Oregon in 1851.

It is based on a memoir by Richard Neville, editor of the Australian satirical magazine Oz, and chronicles his relationship with girlfriend Louise Ferrier, the launch of the London edition of Oz amidst the 1960s counterculture, and the staff's trial for distributing an obscene issue. Hippie Hippie Shake stars Cillian Murphy as Richard Neville, with Sienna Miller as Louise. British film production company Working Title began development of Hippie Hippie Shake in 1998, but the film was repeatedly delayed, changing directors and screenwriters. In September 2007, the film finally began principal photography. In 2011, Working Title said that the film would not be released in cinemas.Garry Maddox and Steve Meacham, \\"Hippies tossed aside in corporate decision\\", The Sydney Morning Herald, February 14, 2011, retrieved 21 October 2012 Premise Hippie Hippie Shake follows the love story of Oz editor Richard Neville and Louise Ferrier, as Neville and his cohorts launch the London edition of the radical magazine, and are put on trial for publishing an obscene issue. The film serves as a metaphorical journey through the 1960s in London.

Screenwriter Don Macpherson was hired to write the adapted screenplay for the film, which was slated to begin production in 1999, depending on Working Title's status following the breakup of PolyGram Filmed Entertainment. Production did not begin as anticipated. Working Title restarted development in February 2002 with director Shekhar Kapur attached to direct based on a script by Tom Butterworth. Again, the project was delayed. In May 2007, Working Title announced its third attempt to produce Hippie Hippie Shake, this time with director Beeban Kidron and screenwriter Lee Hall. The film, which would be distributed by Universal Pictures, was slated to begin production in the autumn of 2007. Production On the set of Hippie Hippie Shake Dec 2009, Colville Terrace, Notting Hill Following William Nicholson's involvement with the script, principal photography began on 17 September 2007. Writer Richard Neville acknowledged the long development history of the film, but considered the film appropriate for the contemporary state of affairs: \\"Given that the world is at war, it couldn't be better timing to highlight the crazy, fun and political times of the 1960s... I think the timing is pretty terrific. Enough time has gone by to perhaps look at that era in a new perspective and help us reflect on what's going on today,\\" Neville said. Parts of the film were shot in the Hampstead district of London, and a house in South Hill Park was used as the exterior of Greer's home. Until his death, South Hill Park was the home of Anthony Minghella, the film director and father of Max Minghella. All Saint's Road was also used as a substitute for King's Road. Release delays In July 2009, \\"creative differences\\" led Beeban Kidron to quit during post- production; her husband, screenwriter Lee Hall, had left the production earlier. According to The Times, Kidron said \\"I worked on the film for as long as I could and as hard as I could and then I had to walk away. It was very wounding.\\" A 100-print release was scheduled for February 2010, but never happened. Reactions The people depicted in the film have had a range of reactions to the film. In July 2007, in a piece for The Guardian, feminist author Germaine Greer vehemently expressed her displeasure at being depicted, writing, \\"You used to have to die before assorted hacks started munching your remains and modelling a new version of you out of their own excreta.\\" Greer refused to be involved with the film, just as she declined to read Neville's memoir before it was published (he had offered to change anything she found offensive). She did not want to meet with Emma Booth, who portrays her in the film, and concluded her article with her only advice for the actress: \\"Get an honest job.\\" Booth had just told The Brisbane Times, \\"It's going to be a bit scary playing her. Germaine is this ballsy lady. I am sure she is going to hate me.\\" In contrast to Greer, Louise Ferrier met with director Kidron to discuss the film at length, and expressed the opinion that Kidron was \\"certainly working to make it authentic.\\" Ferrier said she was unfamiliar with the work of Sienna Miller, the actress portraying her. Publisher Felix Dennis was more cooperative, however, and agreed to meet up with Chris O'Dowd, the actor who portrays him in the film. \\"He was an incredibly charismatic man\\", O'Dowd stated. Test screening reviews Several advance reviews of Hippie Hippie Shake have surfaced across the Internet. Harry Palmer from Ain't It Cool News said, \\"There are some predictable scenes, some hammy acting, some bad jokes, but they couldn't spoil my enjoyment. I'm sorry, but I really liked it.\\" He was especially impressed by Sienna Miller, saying, \\"And yes, there is full-frontal nudity from Sienna. She has a natural, un-made-up look for most of the film, one might even say uglified in places. But when kneeling in a garden drenched in daisies and with a beatific expression on her face, she poses for an 'alternative' Oz centrefold ‚Äì she is stunningly, stunningly beautiful.\\" Jandy Stone from The Frame opined, \\"all the actors carry their parts well.\\" Of the film, she concluded that \\"since there‚Äôs no release date in sight yet, they may well improve it into quite a decent ‚Äô60s biopic.\\" Matt Robinson said, \\"Starring Cillian Murphy and Sienna Miller the film captures the time period effectively presenting both drama, sex and drugs against a setting of media scrutiny and restrictions.\\" He wrote, \\"Colourful, funny and dramatic this is not only a good film it is educational too. A good document of history that many journalists and nonjournalists will enjoy.\\" ReferencesExternal links * Category:Working Title Films films Category:Unreleased films Category:Hippie films Category:British films Category:Films directed by Beeban Kidron Category:Cancelled films Category:English-language films Category:Films produced by Eric Fellner Category:Films produced by Tim Bevan ","title":"Hippie Hippie Shake"},{"id":"13435939","text":"Max Brendon Costa Pinheiro or simply Max (born July 10, 1983 in S√£o Lu√≠s), is a Brazilian forward who plays for R√≠ver Atl√©tico Clube.

Buttershaw is a residential area of Bradford, West Yorkshire, England. It is bounded by Horton Bank Top to the north, Wibsey to the east, Woodside to the south and Shelf to the west. Buttershaw consists mostly of 1940s council housing with the building starting in 1947 and continuing until the 1960s. These parts of Buttershaw gained notoriety in 1986 when they were featured as the setting for most of the scenes in the film Rita, Sue and Bob Too, based on plays by local resident Andrea Dunbar. The estate gained something of a cult status thanks to the film, although at first there was much discontent among local people who complained that it further tarnished the estate's already undesirable reputation. Since the 1980s, many of the older homes around Buttershaw (including some of the blocks of flats that appeared in several of the film's scenes) have been demolished to be replaced by new homes. In 2013, Buttershaw was the setting for the film The Selfish Giant, which had a limited release but was generally well-received by critics.  History  trolleybus terminus in Buttershaw. The original settlement of Buttershaw was about to the east, which is why Buttershaw's church of St Paul's is in Wibsey. The settlement moved west in the 19th century with the building of Bottomley's Mill on Halifax Road and the construction of workers' cottages (such as Bottomley Street) adjacent to the existing settlement of Beck Hill. The construction of the council estate moved the centre of the district northward on to what was then farm land, which prior to the 20th century had been extensively mined. The Ordnance Survey map of 1852 shows the density of mines across the area, and that for 1910 shows the conversion to farm land.  Education  Primary schools in the area include Reevy Hill Primary School and St Paul's Church of England Primary School. The rugby union player Frank Whitcombe Jr attended Buttershaw St Paul's Church School Buttershaw Business and Enterprise College is the main secondary school serving the area. It opened in 1956 as Buttershaw Secondary School on Reevy Road. It has since been renamed Buttershaw Comprehensive School, and over the years it has evolved into an Upper, then High School. 2008 saw the opening of a new building at the school. As the new building was opened the school was renamed Buttershaw Business and Enterprise College.

After the war, Lazarowicz remained in hiding and become a member of the anti-Communist organization Wolnosc i Niezawislosc, fighting for Polish independence from the Soviet Union. He was imprisoned by the Soviet imposed Communist authorities in Poland and executed on March 1, 1951, in the Mokot√≥w Prison in Warsaw.  Early years  Adam was born in 1902 in the village of Berezowica Ma≈Ça (near Zbaraz, now in Ternopil Oblast, Ukraine) to Franciszek Lazarowicz and Wanda, n√©e Ojak. At the age of 17, Lazarowicz joined the Polish Army. In 1919 he fought the Ukrainians in Volhynia during the Polish-Ukrainian War. Then he took part in the Polish- Soviet War and was wounded during the battle of Ostro≈Çƒôka. After this conflict, he graduated from a gymnasium in Jas≈Ço, and later from the History Department of Krak√≥w‚Äôs renowned Jagiellonian University. Due to an unknown sickness, Lazarowicz was dismissed from the Army and took up the job of a teacher in a school in the village of Gumniska, a few kilometers from Dƒôbica. However, he remained in the reserve, and in 1936 was promoted to Colonel.  World War II = 1939 Campaign  During the Polish September Campaign Lazarowicz volunteered again, and he became military commandant of the town of Dƒôbica. When Dƒôbica‚Äôs garrison withdrew to the east he joined troops fighting Germans in the area of Rawa Ruska. In October 1939, after the hostilities ended, he returned to Gumniska where he organized an underground elementary school.  Anti-German resistance  In 1940 Lazarowicz became engaged in the anti-German Sluzba Zwyciestwu Polsce organization, then joined the Zwiazek Walki Zbrojnej. Later, he was promoted to commander of Dƒôbica (‚ÄúDeser‚Äù) District of the Home Army (Armia Krajowa) and remained on this post until spring of 1944. He was a skillful organizer, under his leadership the Home Army in Dƒôbica and vicinity thrived and due to his decision, headquarters of the District were moved from dangerous Dƒôbica to the relatively safe village of Gumniska. The Germans never found out about it. Lazarowicz‚Äôs work was highly appreciated by the Regional Command of the Home Army in Rzesz√≥w. He organized 10 outposts of the organization, in several locations of the Dƒôbica County (e.g. in Pilzno and Ropczyce). Due to his efforts, Dƒôbica District of the Home Army was regarded as the best organized of the whole Rzesz√≥w Command. In 1943 Lazarowicz was promoted to Captain, then to Major. A year later, together with his men he worked out the German Army firing ground at the village of Blizna, where V-2 rockets were tested (see also Home Army and V1 and V2). In the spring of 1944 he became inspector deputy of the Rzesz√≥w Inspectorate of the Home Army, and during Operation Tempest, he was commander of Dƒôbica's 5th Mounted Rifles Regiment of the Home Army, which numbered some 1200 soldiers. In February 1944 Lazarowicz's men organized an unsuccessful attack on a train carrying Hans Frank. As a reprisal, the Germans shot 54 Poles. A monument commemorating this event is located by the rail track in Dƒôbica.  After World War II  In late 1944, when the area of Dƒôbica was captured by the Red Army, the Soviets awarded Lazarowicz the Red Star Order, as a gesture of appreciation of his efforts. However, he refused to accept it and in February 1945 moved to Rzesz√≥w, where he became commander of the Rzeszow District of Wolnosc i Niezawislosc, an anti-communist Polish underground organization. Later, Lazarowicz moved to Wroc≈Çaw, organizing the WiN in these parts. In December 1946 he became deputy of ≈Åukasz Ciepli≈Ñski.  Arrest and execution  Lazarowicz was arrested by the UrzƒÖd Bezpiecze≈Ñstwa (Polish secret police) in ≈ªnin on December 5, 1947. After a brutal investigation, he was transported to Warsaw and placed in the Mokot√≥w Prison. In October 1950, he was sentenced to death. His execution took place on March 1, 1951.  Aftermath  For fifty years, Lazarowicz's story was censored from all publications by the Soviet imposed Communist government of the People's Republic of Poland. In 1992, after the collapse of the Communist system, the Military Court of the Warsaw District issued a decree which voided the 1951 sentence. A memorial plaque commemorating Lazarowicz can be found on the school in Gumniska. Also, since 1993 there has been a street named after him in Dƒôbica.

One of the most important scholars of Christian-Arabic literature, his 5-volume Geschichte der christlichen arabischen Literatur is the foundational text in the field. Life Georg Graf was born in M√ºnsingen, Germany, in 1875. He entered the seminary of Dillingen, where he studied Greek, Latin and Hebrew, while privately he also studied Syriac and Arabic. In 1902-1903 he completed his studies at Munich, studying ancient Egyptian, Coptic, modern Greek and later Georgian. In 1903 he obtained a doctorate of philology with his thesis on Arabic-Christian literature up to the 11th century, which was published in 1905. This brought him to the attention of the founder of the journal al- Machriq, Louis Cheikh√¥, for whom Graf held a high regard. From 1910 - 1911 he studied Christian literature at monasteries, while living in Jerusalem. He also visited Beirut for a short stay. In 1918 Graf obtained a doctorate of theology from the University of Freiburg with a monograph on Marqus Ibn al- Qunbar (Ein Reformversuch innerhalb der Koptischen Kirche im zw√∂lften Jahrhundert), published in 1923. Further research visits to Egypt, Syria and Palestine followed. In 1930 he was named Honorary Professor for Christian Oriental literature at the theology faculty of the university of Munich. In 1946 he was appointed a papal chaplain. He died in Dillingen an der Donau in 1955. The tennis star Steffi Graf is a distant relative.

However, before he was able to embark on a football career, he did his National service with the Royal Welsh Fusiliers serving with the British Army on the Rhine. He was spotted by Aston Villa Scouts Aston Villa during a match between the Villains and the B.A.O.R football team in Biebrich Germany. Impressed by his performance they asked the British Army permission to take him on. He signed with Aston Villa in 1930 and debuted his first division association football match against Manchester City at Maine Road in November 1931, replacing Biddestone who had been injured before kick off. Aston Villa After a trial with Villa in October 1930, he was signed as an amateur and made his club debut for the reserves in a Central League game against Everton Reserves on 22 November 1930. He went on to sign as a professional in March 1931. By the end of the 1931‚Äì32 season he had displaced Fred Biddlestone as first choice 'keeper and missed only one league game over the next three seasons, helping Villa to claim the runners-up position in the Football League in the 1932‚Äì33 season and reach the semi-finals of the FA Cup in 1933‚Äì34. His form with Villa brought him to the attention of the England selectors but, although he had a trial in 1934, he was unsuccessful and the selectors chose Arsenal's Frank Moss instead to replace the injured Harry Hibbs. Everton In March 1937, Morton moved to Everton, making his debut in a 2‚Äì1 defeat at West Bromwich Albion on 13 March 1937. In his two years at Goodison Park, Morton was the understudy to Ted Sagar and only made 27 league and 2 FA Cup appearances. In Everton's Championship winning season, 1938‚Äì39, Morton only made one appearance. In the summer of 1939, Morton was transferred to Burnley, but his career was brought to an end following the outbreak of the Second World War.

It was the first mass-produced and mass-marketed alternative to lard and is remembered today chiefly for its iconic national ad campaign and the cookbooks that were written to promote its use. Ad for Cottolene, 1915. According to Dr. Alice Ross, writing in the Journal of Antiques and Collectibles, Cottolene emerged as an offshoot of two industries. Cotton seeds were a waste product of the cotton industry, and beef tallow was a waste product of the meat- processing industry. The N. K. Fairbank Corporation of Chicago seized on this glut and created a product catering to late-19th-century America's growing infatuation with labor-saving packaged foods for the \\"dainty\\" (lard-free) diet. It was comparable to and a competitor of Procter & Gamble's Crisco, which was packaged similarly and marketed with accompanying cookbooks. Crisco was composed entirely of cottonseed oil.

Some early accounts stated that was used as stuffing for the binding of a codex of Philo, written in the late third century and found walled up in a house at Coptos.Roberts (1979) p. 8 Apparently this account was incorrect, however, as the fragments were actually found stashed between pages of the codex of Philo, not in the binding. Philip Comfort and David Barret in their book Text of the Earliest NT Greek Manuscripts argue that came from the same codex as , the Magdalen papyrus, and date the texts to 150-175.Comfort (2001) pp. 50-53, see also Comfort (1999) Willker tentatively agrees stating 'The [3rd century] dating given is that of NA. Some date it into the 2nd CE (e.g. Roberts and Comfort). This is quite probable considering the use as binding material for a 3rd CE codex'. Comfort and Barret also show that and have affinities with a number of late 2nd century papyri.i.e. P. Oxy. 224, 661, 2334, 2404 2750, P. Ryl. 16, 547, and P.

Frederic Kenyon dated to the fourth century. In 2018, Brent Nongbri argued that it was not possible with current knowledge to date to a specific century, and that any dates from the 2nd to 4th centuries were equally reasonable.

Gameplay, story and universe Totems is a 3D platformer for the Xbox 360 and PC. The player controls the main character Gia, a parkour expert. Gia inherits various powers from four different animal totem spirits. Totems utilizes a Semantic Environment Sensing System (SESS), meaning all of these actions can be performed with one button and Gia will react automatically according to the place she is in the world. Each spirit will be mapped to a face button on the 360 controller enabling players to pull off parkour moves and attacks very quickly. The game contains a non-linear world placed on a fictional island and a highly interactive environment. The enemies Gia encounters are able to perform similar acrobatic abilities and their AI enables them to follow Gia wherever she goes. The developers are creating a whole new shaman mythology for Totems. 10tacle Studios Belgium 10tacle Studios Belgium, located in Charleroi, Belgium, is specialised in the development of video games.

Edward Cudahy Sr. was the wealthy owner of the Cudahy Packing Company, which helped build the Omaha Stockyards through the 1950s. Cudahy Sr. paid the ransom for the return of his son and made the kidnapper, Pat Crowe, a popular author, lecturer and actor for a brief period.\\"Cudahy Kidnapping\\".

Kidnapping On the evening of December 18, 1900, 16-year-old Edward Cudahy Jr. left his house to run an errand in his Old Gold Coast neighborhood. As he walked home, a carriage pulled beside him and a man jumped out and grabbed him, pulling him inside. His father, the millionaire owner of Cudahy Packing Company at the Omaha Stockyards, returned from a dinner engagement at 10:30 that evening to discover his son missing. The next morning, the Omaha Bee, the Daily News, and the World-Herald all carried the story across their front pages.Johnson, A.S., et al. (1902) Cyclopedic Review of Current History. Garretson, Cox & Company. p 40. The next morning, Cudahy closed his plant and encouraged his 2,000 workers to look for his son. His competitors did the same, and soon 7,000 people were searching Omaha. At 9:00 am, he received a phone call advising him to search his front yard, where his coachman found a ransom note: > Mr. Cudahy: We have kidnapped your child and demand $25,000 for his safe > return. If you give us the money he will return as safe as when you last saw > him, but if you refuse, we will put acid in his eyes and blind him...

When you come to a lantern...by the side of the road, place > the money by the lantern and immediately turn your horse around and return > home. The kidnapper foresaw the possibility of Cudahy not paying the ransom, and also referred in his note to the kidnapping of Charley Ross, aged 4, in Philadelphia on July 1, 1874. After being advised by police not to pay the ransom, his father, Christian Ross, a wealthy merchant, never saw his child again. The Cudahy kidnapper noted that Christian Ross regretted for the rest of his life that he took the advice of the police. Their note continued, > Ross died of a broken heart, sorry that he allowed the detectives to dictate > to him. Cudahy, you are up against it, and there is only one way out - give > up the coin.

At 7:00 on the night of the 19th, Cudahy alone arrived at the lantern, which was located near the Little Papio Creek. He left the money along with a note in reply to the captors. He returned to the Cudahy mansion at 9:30 pm. Eddie Jr. returned home at 1:00 am, unharmed. Johnson, A.S., et al. (1902) Cyclopedic Review of Current History. Garretson, Cox & Company. p 41. National response Paying the kidnappers fueled a national debate. The San Francisco Examiner condemned the action: \\"Mr. Cudahy had acted as a bad citizen because it will encourage others.\\" The Omaha Bee noted that Cudahy spoke in a \\"nonchalant tone\\" about paying the $25,000, as though he \\"had just dropped a nickel down a cellar grating.\\" Manhunt Cudahy posted a $25,000 reward and hired the Pinkerton Detective Agency to lead a manhunt, which the World-Herald called \\"the nation's leading thrill.\\" After a statement from Eddie Jr., reporters found the kidnapper's hideout in South Omaha. Pat Crowe, a small butcher- shop operator in South Omaha, was identified as a suspect early in the investigation. However, nobody could find Crowe. During January 1901, Crowe sightings were reported from Central America to Nantucket Island, with one report placing him on a steamship in Honduras, and another at the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota. Thousands of \\"Crowe wanted\\" posters were shipped across the United States. In March 1901, the Omaha City Council matched Cudahy's reward, and later in the month, a man named James Callahan was arrested for public drunkenness, his fine for which he paid with a shiny $20 gold coin, just like Cudahy had paid some of the ransom with. Callahan was also known to associate with Crowe. Police observed Callahan paying with the coins at taverns in Omaha, and on March 21, they arrested him for robbing Cudahy Sr. of $25,000. When he went to trial, he did not face kidnapping charges; Nebraska had none that applied to the kidnapping of a 16-year-old within city limits. While that soon changed, it did not change Callahan's trial, and on April 28, the jury found him not guilty of robbery. Another trial in November also found him not guilty.(1905) Michigan newspaper . Retrieved 9/25/07. Crowe communicated with the Omaha Police Department through the mail. Despite agreeing to turn himself in after negotiating the drop of the ransom in late 1901, Crowe never showed up. In the spring of 1905, he turned up in Omaha and gave an interview to a World-Herald reporter; however, he disappeared again. On September 5, 1905, he was spotted at a tavern in Little Bohemia; the ensuing gun fight left one police officer wounded, and Crowe vanished again.\\"The Bold Cudahy Kidnapping and Peculiar American Justice.\\" Criminal Library. Retrieved 9/25/07. Capture and trial In early November 1905, Crowe was captured by police in Butte, Montana. On November 28, 1905, Crowe pleaded not guilty to shooting the Omaha police officer in the September \\"Battle on Hickory Street\\". He was also charged with robbing a street car in Omaha of $50, and for robbery in the Cudahy kidnapping case. Despite four days of testimony from dozens of witnesses, the jury acquitted Crowe after 80 minutes of deliberations. The judge held him for the next trial, which began in February 1906; 92 witnesses were called by the prosecution, and none was called by the defense. The Chicago Examiner, following the case along with many national newspapers, proclaimed the defense's closing statement to be \\"considered the best speech in a criminal case ever made in Omaha.\\" After 17 hours of deliberations on St. Patrick's Day, 1906, the jury declared Crowe not guilty. Responding to the trial, The Washington Post wrote, \\"Omaha is evidently a happy hunting ground for savages and malefactors.\\" Aftermath Crowe's criminal notoriety gained him fame as a lecturer, author, and actor across the United States, until he eventually died in poverty in Harlem in 1938. His written personal narratives of the story are studied today for their authenticity.\\"All things made new.\\" University of Virginia. Retrieved 9/25/07.

It is a \\"documentary novel\\" that combines the facts of the case with journalistic depictions of actual participants and fictional characters and events. Sinclair indicted the American system of justice by setting his characters in the context of the prosecution and execution of Sacco and Vanzetti. Research and writing Sinclair worked from a passionate conviction that the executions of Sacco and Vanzetti constituted \\"the most shocking crime that has been committed in American history since the assassination of Abraham Lincoln\\" and a belief that \\"It will empoison our public life for a generation.\\"Harris, 244 He interviewed Bartolomeo Vanzetti twice and conducted research following the execution of Sacco and Vanzetti in 1927. For his central character he used as his model a California acquaintance who recounted stories of her earlier life amid Boston's aristocracy. As part of his research he attended the funeral of a Boston industrialist. He recognized that some of his readers might find that disrespectful and offered this defense: \\"if you are a novelist you think about 'copy' and not about anybody's feelings, even your own.\\"Sinclair, Autobiography, 240-1 To verify dialogue, he even contacted a journalist to verify his fidelity in transcribing a jailhouse conversation. As a result, he avoided repeating the oft-quoted description of Sacco and Vanzetti, falsely attributed to Vanzetti, as \\"a good shoemaker and a poor fish peddler.\\"D'Attilio, 77, details how journalist Phil Strong explained in a letter to Upton Sinclair that he inserted those words into the transcript of his interview with Vanzetti in order to \\"inject that humility and simplicity that was in his [Vanzetti's] presence into my story artificially.\\" In hundreds of letters he sought to acquire and verify details, such as the timing and physical setting of prison visits. He asked other correspondents to review parts of the manuscript for errors.Harris, 244-5 Another bit of his research has attracted periodic interest and political criticism.Harris, 246; and Bloodworth, 115-6. The controversy erupted again in 2005-6. For the charges see Los Angeles Times: Jean O. Pasco, \\"Sinclair Letter Turns Out to Be Another Expose,\\" December 24, 2005, accessed July 6, 2010. For the rebuttal see Greg Mitchell \\"Sliming a Famous Muckraker: The Untold Story,\\" in Editor & Publisher, January 30, 2006, available online as History News Network: \\"Roundup: Talking About History\\" , accessed July 6, 2010 He interviewed Fred Moore, who served as defense attorney for the murder trial. Moore offered his opinion that Sacco was probably guilty of the payroll robbery, while Vanzetti might have known of plans for the robbery but not participated. Opponents of Sinclair's politics contend that his failure to adapt Moore's judgment in the novel constitutes a betrayal of his documentary claims. Sinclair, on the other hand, did not consider Moore's estimation determinative and Moore never claimed that either defendant had ever confessed his guilt to him.Neville, 55, 152 Much like the principal characters in the novel, Sinclair claimed no certain knowledge, only his instinct: \\"I did not know and could only guess.\\"Sinclair, Autobiography, 242Sinclair described his conversation with Moore in 1953. Richard Newby, ed., Kill Now, Talk Forever (Bloomington, IN: 1st Books Library, 2001), 507-8, quoting Upton Sinclair, \\"The Fishpeddler and the Shoemaker,\\" in Institute of Social Studies Bulletin, II (1953) Later research has documented that Moore told Sinclair that the two were guilty and that he had contrived their alibis. Following the novel's publication, Sinclair wrote in a private letter to John Beardsley that this had presented him with \\"the most difficult ethical problem of my life\\", but he had not altered the presentation he had planned for his novel, as everyone with whom he had spoken who had in-depth knowledge of the case had given him contradictory reports as to the guilt or innocence of Sacco and Vanzetti. \\"So you see that in the end I don't really know any more about the thing than I did in the beginning, and can only take my stand as I did in \\"Boston\\", upon the thesis that men should not be executed upon anybody's rumors.\\"Upton Sinclair's 1929 letter to John Beardsley Upton Sinclair In sum, he wrote: \\"Some of the things I told displeased the fanatical believers; but having portrayed the aristocrats as they were, I had to do the same thing for the anarchists.\\" He expanded on the situation in a letter:Harris, 246 :All these matters are terribly complicated....my problem was the hardest I have ever faced in my life.... It is my belief that if I had taken an entirely naive attitude toward the Sacco-Vanzetti defense, and represented the defense as all white and prosecution as all black, I would have done very little good to the case, because too many people know the truth, and it is bound to come out sooner or later. The only thing I would accomplish would be to destroy entirely my own reputation as a trustworthy writer. I have never hesitated about my own reputation where it was in a good cause. But I really could not see any sense in making myself foolish to no purpose. A detailed analysis of Sinclair's \\"investigative method\\" cites a number of questionable assertions, but concludes that in Boston \\"one discovers a fidelity to the factual record which is seldom met with in historical novels.\\"Joughin and Morgan, 445-54, quotes 445, 454 Publication Sinclair met with attorneys in New York City to make final changes to the text to allay their fears of libel suits.May Craig Sinclair, Southern Belle: A Personal Story of a Crusader's Wife (NY: Crown Publishers, 1957), 312 The novel first appeared serially in The Bookman between February and November 1928 under the title \\"Boston, a Contemporary Historical Novel\\" and was then published in 2 volumes by Albert & Charles Boni that same year.Ronald Gottesman, Upton Sinclair: An Annotated Checklist (Kent State University Press, 1973), entries A1169, A1195.

Sinclair hoped Boston would win the Pulitzer Prize, but the chairman of the 1928 Pulitzer Prize Committee said his personal opinion was that its \\"socialistic tendencies\\" and \\"special pleading\\" made it unsuitable. When the Committee named John B. Oliver's Victim and Victor instead, Sinclair denounced the selection in a widely distributed letter that pointed out how that novel was as argumentative as Boston only for a more respectable cause. In the end, the Pulitzer advisory committee at the Columbia University School of Journalism overrode the Committee's choice and awarded the Pulitzer to Julia Peterkin's Scarlet Sister Mary.Harris, 250-1 Criticism Boston met with a largely favorable reception, though some found difficulties with its political perspective or its length and detail. One scholarly assessment a few years after its publication located it in the tradition of the realistic and socially conscious novel, a successor to Dickens' Hard Times, Uncle Tom's Cabin, and the novels and plays of Galsworthy.Lovett, 97-8, 101 In this view, Boston \\"compares favorably with its predecessors of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.\\"Lovett, 102 Though Boston is \\"fifty percent pamphlet,\\" Sinclair's \\"mingling of actual and fictitious characters...has brought the historical novel up to date, and created a new form of realism.\\"Lovett, 104-5 Yet even this critic thought the novel could have proved more persuasive. \\"One suspects that the patently biased comment of the author weakens rather than strengthens his case, and that greater artfulness in presenting the facts might have brought the disinterested or disaffected reader into more active sympathy with his viewpoint.\\"Lovett, 105 Though allowing that some readers will be irritated by Sinclair's broad attack on private property, this critic concluded that \\"whatever the reaction to the doctrine it sets forth, no one can doubt the eloquence of the plea.\\"Lovett, 112 Publications that sympathized with Sinclair's politics greeted Boston with glowing reviews. The Nation compared him favorably to Dickens and Fielding.Harris, 249 The New York Times, normally quite critical, praised it apart from its politics as \\"a literary achievement...wrought into a narrative on the heroic scale with form and coherence,\\" demonstrating \\"a craftsmanship in the technique of the novel that the author has seldom displayed before.\\"New York Times: Others voicing enthusiasm included his sometime political adversary Lewis Mumford (\\"it has the finality of truth and art\\") and Arthur Conan Doyle (\\"the Zola of America\\").Harris, 250 Sinclair's failure to avow the innocence of Sacco and Vanzetti brought denunciations from the political left, including former allies. One called him \\"a hired liar, a coward and a traitor.\\" During the novel's serial publication, he even feared that \\"some anarchist might think it his duty to keep me from finishing the book.\\"Harris, 245-6 Synopsis Chapter 1: The Runaway GrandmotherSee also R. Baird Shuman, Great American Writers: Twentieth Century, vol. 10 (Tarrytown, NY: Marshall Cavendish, 2002), 1390-1; available online, accessed August 5, 2010 The summer of 1915. The Thornwell estate outside of Boston. Cornelia Thornwell, aged 60, is suddenly widowed after 40 disappointing years of marriage: \\"she had lived, a prisoner in a cell.\\" (31) The family is patrician and powerful, part of New England's economic and cultural elite. Her 3 daughters, all married to millionaires, squabble over their inheritances during funeral preparations. They continue their disputes as relations and retainers assemble for the reading of the will. Cornelia sees their behavior as \\"the revelation of hidden natures.\\" \\"Trembling with excitement,\\" (32) she pens a farewell note declaring herself a \\"runaway grandmother\\" (33) and asking the family not to pursue her. She leaves by a back stairway. Chapter 2: Plymouth Rock Calling herself Mrs. Cornell, Cornelia finds work at a cordage plant in Plymouth, a town not far from Boston. She learns how hard factory work is and how hard the life of the poor. She boards with the Brini family and becomes friends with their other boarder, Bartolomeo Vanzetti, an Italian immigrant ditch digger, atheist, anarchist, and pacifist. She first thinks his political beliefs naive, \\"a dreamer of dreams, so simple of mind as to have no conception of the odds against him,\\" (56) especially his opposition to reformers and all organizations, even unions. Early in 1916, shortly after a public meeting Vanzetti and his anarchist comrades hold to promote their ideas, a spontaneous strike breaks out. Chapter 3: Dago Red Cornelia participates in the strike, learns how the police work for the plant's management and attack picketers. The courts do no more than \\"give the police a mild rebuke for their conduct.\\" (74) Vanzetti acquires a rusty gun, though only to protect a visiting speaker, the anarchist theoretician Galleani. Cornelia hears echoes in his speech of Thoreau and Emerson. She witnesses Vanzetti getting into violent arguments that contrast with his gentle nature. The strike ends after a month and the workers have won a raise but at the cost of lost wages. \\"Little by little, Cornelia came to understand the type of idealist-fanatic, which could be gentle as a child in all personal relationships, but fierce and dangerous when roused by social wrong.\\" (82) Chapter 4: Young America One day by chance Cornelia meets her favorite granddaughter, Betty Arvin, who is excited to learn of Cornelia's year. Cornelia confesses her new attachment to pacifism even as her relatives profit from war. Betty visits the Brinis and meets Vanzetti, who explains that he is no pacifist, that he believes there are powerful people to be fought. He condemns the war in Europe and tells his life story. Betty writes Cornelia letters and reports how her enthusiasm for women's rights scares off her suitors. Cornelia attends an anarchist-sponsored picnic and a play attacking militarism in which Nicola Sacco appears. Late in November 1916, Rupert and Deborah Arvin arrive in Plymouth, having learned Cornelia's address from one of Betty's letters. Cornelia defends her views on war even as they accuse her of poisoning Betty's mind. Cornelia agrees to return to Boston to reconcile Betty and her parents. She finds the situation there already calmed and decides to return to Boston but live apart from the family, imagining she and Betty can share their ideas but only with one another. Chapter 5: The Saving Minority Cornelia, now living in a modest apartment, speaks against U.S. involvement in the war despite her family's objections. Vanzetti leaves for Mexico, mistakenly afraid he might be drafted. Cornelia and Betty march in a pacifist demonstration, provoking another family battle. Cornelia visits Jerry Walker and his family. Cornelia understands how his business plans are being frustrated by the banking establishment, members of her own family. Fall 1917. Betty enters Radcliffe and lives with her grandmother. In reaction to the Bolshevik Revolution, \\"city policemen, federal secret agents, and an army of spies and informers\\" (149) wage a violent and illegal campaign on behalf of people of property. They seize a letter from Vanzetti to Cornelia. The ensuing family battle engages Cornelia and Betty against her mother Deborah. Vanzetti appears at Cornelia's door. Chapter 6: White Terror Cornelia's sons-in-law, Henry Cabot Winters and Rupert Alvin, lie to her about their manipulations to put Walker out of business. He is ruined. The war ends. Cornelia and Betty are arrested marching with suffragists. Another Thornwell family council ensues. Government authorities terrorize everyone the political left. Vanzetti is now selling fish from a cart. Cornelia is dismayed to hear how Betty is not fazed to imagine Vanzetti in a gunfight with the police: \\"Where had she acquired that matter-of-fact smile, discussing the mad idea of resisting arrest?\\" (181) Betty leaves for Europe chaperoned by a distant cousin. Cornelia confounds the family by joining her. They travel to Russia. Chapter 7: Deportation Days The Boston police strike. Betty stays on in Budapest and Cornelia returns. Only Vanzetti and the anarchists want to learn what she has seen. She attends Christmas celebrations with the Thornwells and the Brinis. Both comment on reports of a payroll holdup in Bridgewater. Anarchists are being deported. Hundreds are arrested and Cornelia works on their behalf. Vanzetti is working on propaganda, believes anarchist mail bombs are the work of provocateurs, and describes how torture makes anarchists swear to false confessions. Betty has lost her chaperon, so Cornelia will join her for a vacation on the Italian lakes. As Cornelia is sailing to Europe, Vanzetti is arrested for the Bridgewater holdup. Chapter 8: The Detective Machine The police identify suspects in two robberies and then develop facts to make their case. Arrested, Vanzetti lies to avoid implicating any of his fellow anarchists. He is the only suspect without an acceptable American alibi. News reaches Cornelia in Italy with Betty, her suitor Joe Randall, an American social democrat, and a French communist named Pierre Leon. In a long discussion of political philosophy, Pierre warns that he has known anarchists to be capable of violence, making his point to Cornelia by citing John Brown. The two women and Joe rush to Boston for the trial and visit Vanzetti in jail. They try to help locate evidence and witnesses. Vanzetti cannot testify on his own behalf without alienating the jury as an anarchist, atheist, and draft dodger. Chapter 9: The Web of Fate Vanzetti's trial for the Bridgewater attempted robbery. Judge Thayer seats a jury of Anglo-Saxons. Attorneys on both sides are friends. Prosecution witnesses alter testimony to fit the prosecution's theory. Only Italians provide an alibi for Vanzetti. Counter witnesses describe Vanzetti's mustache. The jurors handle bullets introduced as evidence. The judge's charge to the jury is not fully recorded. After the guilty verdict, Vanzetti writes letters from prison. The Thornwells are concerned about Joe's background. The family weathers the post-war deflation and squeezes the only Jewish banker out. Charles Ponzi, an Italian immigrant, launches the scheme that will bear his name. Walker distresses Alvin and Winter with a lawsuit even as they plot to defeat radicals in Italy as they have in other European countries. Chapter 10: The Legal System Cornelia finds that an establishment lawyer expects to be paid thousands. Facing the prosecution of Sacco and Vanzetti for the Braintree robbery-murder, the anarchists select Lee Swenson as defense attorney. He is experienced in criminal cases arising from labor disputes. Cornelia briefs Swenson about the defendants, describing Sacco as a man who \\"does very little thinking.\\" (291) Swenson explains that the government's dishonest prosecution, a \\"frame-up,\\" (295) needs to be fought with the same methods. He will need to \\"build a good alibi.\\" (296) Cornelia recognizes that she has been invited to commit perjury and \\"moral whirlwinds seize her thoughts.\\" (299) She considers how lies prove effective in business and politics. The next day Betty announces she and Joe now consider themselves married without benefit of law or clergy. Cornelia will permit them to use her apartment rather than announce this to the family. Swenson reports that a certain Mrs. De Falco has offered to serve as intermediary for a bribe that will get the government will drop the case. Chapter 11: The Graft Ring The anarchist supporters want to pay the bribe, but Swenson frustrates them by publicly denouncing the scheme. Betty's mother receives an anonymous letter threatening to reveal her daughter's indiscretions. She and Cornelia debate \\"the ethics of free love versus purchased love.\\" (323) Betty's older sister Priscilla's wedding. Vanzetti is upset that the justice system will condemn Mrs. De Falco, the least guilty party in the bribery scheme. He predicts that Lee's refusal to accept the bribery system will make the prosecution redouble their anti-radical efforts. More poison pen letters reach the Thornwells. When Cornelia's grandson Josiah is blackmailed for sexual misbehavior, the family's history of secret affairs is discussed along with similar behavior on the part of Boston's ruling elite and occasional bribes. Mrs. De Falco is found not guilty, but the prosecution responds as Vanzetti predicted. Chapter 12: Shadows Before Swenson is joined by attorney Fred Moore and they struggle to identify and prepare witnesses. Accounts of unreliable witnesses and others pressured to testify or to withhold information. Too much critical evidence will be discovered too late. Swenson, pessimistic about his case, confronts Cornelia and proposes she perjure herself to provide the defendants with an alibi. Cornelia can not agree to do so, even though \\"what was supposed to be justice was really class greed.\\" (365) The narrator's voice proposes that by adhering to her principles she hopes to maintain: \\"your exclusiveness, your idea that you were something special, apart from the harsh, rough world‚Äîin short that you were 'Boston'!\\" (366) Just before the start of the trial, mass displays of patriotism mark Memorial Day. Cornelia attends a ceremony naming a street intersection for her grandnephew who died in France. She weeps for the dead of the wars the nation is now arming to fight. Chapter 13: Trial by Jury The scene as the Dedham trial opens, with the defendants seated in a steel cage. Judge Thayer speaks his mind to reporters, but newspaper owners decide what gets into print. Corrupted witnesses testify, and the judge intervenes with obvious prejudice. He is careful that his recorded words do not reflect the bias he shows by his body language. Walker's case against the bankers is moving forward and will make the lives of Cornelia's relations difficult. In the course of arbitrating a family marital squabble, she learns how her relations are working to punish government officials who have opposed their interests. The trial continues with testimony that proves little but has a cumulative effect. The defense struggles with a dishonest court interpreter. Ballistics testimony is crafted for Thayer to misuse in his eventual summary to the jury, though a key witness will withdraw his statements 2 years later. Chapter 14: Judge Fury Cornelia and the Thornwells attend her grandson's Harvard graduation. Defense witnesses are mostly Italians and all struggle under aggressive cross examination. Vanzetti, his English improved while in prison, testifies and recounts his life story. The judge prevents the jury from hearing about the government's persecution of anarchists, his reason for fearing arrest. The cross examination emphasizes his sojourn in Mexico as a draft dodger. Sacco's testimony is less disciplined and the prosecution mocks him on cross. Thayer invites Cornelia to his chambers and they have an angry confrontation. The judge, alleging he was misquoted, lies to a reporter. The defense is short of funds, so Cornelia sells some of her jewels to her daughter Deborah. Swenson has run out of witnesses and directly proposes perjury to Cornelia, who responds with a distraught \\"Don't ask me!\\" (434) Summations are followed by Thayer's charge to the jury, mostly about loyalty and a prejudiced restatement of the evidence. The jury returns its verdict: both guilty on all counts. Chapter 15: The Whispering Gallery Swenson withdraws and Moore takes over motions and appeals. Cornelia's plans to speak in New York rouse her relations. She discusses the affair at length with Henry Cabot Winters. Cornelia admits knowing little of Sacco. She thinks Vanzetti capable of a violent rage if confronting the police, but never of a cold-blooded murder. She insists on the unfairness of the trial, Winters on the violence inherent in the defendants' philosophy. Cornelia describes the violence she has witnessed. Betty joins this \\"duel of moral forces.\\" (463) When Betty announces that Joe's divorce is final and they plan to wed, Cornelia weeps, pretending she is happy for the couple, but her tears reflect the evening's arguments. \\"Women, who have been but a short time emancipated, do not defy and insult the mighty males of their clan without terrific inner disturbances.\\" (467) The press reports of the wedding of the press agent for the Sacco-Vanzetti Defense to a Boston blue blood are sensational. The defense uncovers new evidence and witnesses change their testimony, all to no avail. Chapter 16: The Law's Delay Jerry Walker's case against the banking establishment takes place in the same Dedham courtroom and lasts a year. Cornelia watches her son-in-law Rupert Arvin manage the defense's systematic lies and feigned forgetfulness. Vanzetti studies and writes in prison, while Sacco finds it harder to bear. At different times, each attempts a hunger strike, resulting in psychiatric examination and treatment. The Catholic Church campaigns against a constitutional amendment banning child labor. Judge Thayer continues to deny defense motions with tortured logic and misrepresentations of the defense arguments. He alienates friends and colleagues with his anti-anarchist rants. Walker wins a jury verdict and stands to receive more than $10 million. Managing the appeal, Rupert Arvin analyzes social connections to members of the Supreme Judicial Court through club memberships and personal ties, nothing crude. Winters transfers all his property to his sister so he can claim to be bankrupt and avoid any payment to Walker. Cornelia attends a family baptism and ponders the words \\"vain pomp and glory.\\" (508) Chapter 17: The Mills of the Law Betty has a baby and allows it to be baptized. Moore's efforts are undermined by anarchist supporters and he resigns. William G. Thompson, a patrician lawyer replaces him, but he antagonizes the anarchists because he has no interest in mobilizing public opinion. His appeal to the elderly judges on the Supreme Judicial Court, all \\"products of the spoils system\\" (519) in Cornelia's view, fails. The defense develops more exculpatory evidence, including a confession by Constance Madeiros that he and the Morelli gang committed the crime. Thayer again denies a motion for a new trial, this time citing dialogue that is not in the court record. Cornelia at least manages to have Madeiros' execution for a different crime postponed. The Supreme Judicial Court hears the appeal in the Walker case and in March 1927 overturns the jury verdict: \\"property was safe.\\" (532) The court also backs Thayer on the Madeiros matter. Thayer then moves promptly to sentencing. In final statements, Sacco is hardly articulate, while Vanzetti is eloquent and speaks \\"as one who is addressing posterity.\\" (535) Thayer places all responsibility on the jury and the Supreme Judicial Court and then sentences the pair to be executed. Chapter 18: The Supersalesman The focus is now on Governor Fuller, a man \\"cold as marble, utterly selfish,\\" (542) who can issue pardons or commute sentences. The press begins to reconsider its negative view of the accused. The Governor is deluged with letters he ignores. Cornelia, now 72, has her son-in-law Winters sound out the Governor. Winters finds that Fuller only knows what the police tell him and does not want to be contradicted: \\"stubbornness is his leading quality.\\" (547) Cornelia decides to campaign behind the scenes to get Fuller to appoint a commission to review the case on his behalf, working through her upper class connections to get the Episcopal bishop to make the suggestion. Felix Frankfurter demolishes Thayer in a magazine article. Fuller conducts his own review, but he is only pretending. The bishop asks the governor to create an Advisory Commission and Fuller does. Cornelia continues to raise money from \\"a small minority of choice spirits.\\" (566) The division of opinion within the Thornwell family mirrors that of the public. Chapter 19: Academic Autocracy The Advisory Commission is headed by Harvard President Lowell, who has \\"a remarkable talent for ungraciousness.\\" (579) It reviews evidence and hears witnesses in secrecy. Portraits of the 3 commissioners. Cornelia is quickly disabused of any hope for an impartial review. She is near despair. The governor visits Sacco and Vanzetti in prison, but he is still play-acting. New exculpatory evidence is discovered and presented but all for naught. The defenders are in anguish. Finally, Cornelia arranges to meet with the governor. He is perfectly polite and promises to consider her views, but clearly does not grasp the details of the case. Chapter 20: The Decision Worldwide attention is focused on the governor, who releases his decision late at night in order to have the next morning's headlines to himself. The advocates for Sacco and Vanzetti are angry and mock his conclusion that \\"The proceedings were without flaw.\\" (610) Cornelia is exhausted and imagines she can only leave the battle to the next generation. She is comforted by Vanzetti's words in an interview he gave earlier: \\"This is our career and our triumph.\\" (613) The narrator hails Vanzetti: \\"You have spoken the noblest word heard in America in the two generations since Abraham Lincoln died.\\" (616) The governor's account of the case is so poor it needs to be buttressed by that of the Advisory Commission. Details of evidence are reviewed again. Cornelia is crushed by the Commission's report, since Lowell \\"was her kind of person, the best she had to offer.\\" (620) Lawyers undertake fruitless legal manoeuvres. A demonstration on Boston Common is broken up by the police. Cornelia has some of her relatives host a dinner for the governor where they plead with him to delay the executions out of concern for Cornelia. Picketers at the State House are arrested. Betty quotes Lenin: \\"The state is a monopoly of violence.\\" (634) Sacco and Vanzetti write farewell letters. Their executions are postponed with only minutes to spare. Chapter 21: Days of Grace Cornelia sees Vanzetti in prison again. The police fear a general strike. Cornelia's college-age grandson joins the cause as do artists like Dos Passos and many unknown who \\"came as individuals, hesitating and confused.\\" (652) They argue legal strategy vs. propaganda. Police break up demonstrations but avoid creating martyrs with arrests. Joe Randall fails to get himself arrested. The Supreme Judicial Court holds a hearing and fails once more to order a new trial. Winters says the legal community agrees reforms are needed, but first \\"The courts must be sustained.\\" (661) He accompanies Cornelia to visit the governor again. When a lawyer defends the Supreme Judicial Court, Cornelia mocks him because he is arguing against that Court in the Walker trial appeal. The governor asks Cornelia if the men are innocent and she answers: \\"Of course I don't know that....I believe that they are innocent and I certainly know this‚Äîthat they have not been proved guilty.\\" (666-7) The governor retorts: \\"I know that they are guilty, so I don't care whether they had a fair trial or not.\\" (667) His conclusion is based on evidence he has heard, nothing in the trial record. Vanzetti's sister visits him in prison. Both he and Sacco write letters to Sacco's 12-year-old son Dante. Chapter 22: The City of Fear Police enforce silence in Boston while worldwide voices grow louder. The defense holds a public meeting in a hall but speakers must limit themselves to generalities. Cornelia arranges for Vanzetti's sister to visit Boston's Catholic Cardinal. Boston has a military presence. On Sunday, August 21, thousands gather on Boston Common and there are scenes of disorder, but people of note are not arrested Supreme Court Justices Homes and Brandeis decline to intervene. Cornelia and her daughter Deborah argue loudly. Cornelia says: \\"I prefer the dynamiter who cares about justice to the most law-abiding person in the world who doesn't!\\" (690) She lectures her granddaughter Priscilla about privilege and exploitation. On Monday, with executions scheduled for midnight, a protest of the well known and elite produces arrests, including Edna St. Vincent Millay as well as Betty and Joe, who give statements to the press. Cornelia visits the governor's wife, and then the governor again, to whom shes argues the case succinctly. Finally, trembling, she denounces him, leaves him speechless, and leaves \\"with despair plainly written upon her aged face.\\" (705) Chapter 23: The Last Enemy Final legal activity and meetings. Sacco's relatives visit with the governor. The Thornwell's fear for Cornelia's health. She refuses sleeping powder. Winters tells her that Fuller's decision is based on word that a drunken anarchist revealed that Sacco was in the car used at Braintree and Vanzetti knew about the robbery in advance. Cornelia, \\"working herself into a cold fury,\\" (714) denounces this evidences based on gossip, unchallenged in court. She gets a pass to visit the prisoners just hours before the executions so she can confront them one last time. She passes through many layers of security and speaks to Vanzetti as Sacco listens. Vanzetti swears innocence and attests to Sacco's. She asks if he has changed his views on violence in the class struggle and he has not. He still belies many will have to die to overthrow the master class. He does not want his death to be avenged. Asked if he forgives his prosecutors and judges, he says he can not say so. He asks Cornelia not to be sad for them because they are just doing their job and dying as anarchists. Chapter 24: The Triumph More legal moves. Cornelia says she is reconciled to the executions but her lips tremble as she speaks. Betty is resolute, believing in the class struggle. They wait past midnight until Joe calls to say Sacco and Vanzetti are dead. A step-by-step account of the executions. The prisoners refuse the attention of a chaplain. At his last moment, Vanzetti says: \\"I wish to forgive some people for what they are now doing to me.\\" (742) The newsmen wire their reports. Demonstrations occur throughout Europe. The narrator summarizes: \\"And now Massachusetts had made her martyrs, and stood upon her pedestal of self-righteousness.\\" (746-7) Funeral arrangements are met with police restrictions. Police disrupt the funeral procession through Boston to Forest Hills cemetery. A member of the defense committee delivers a brief, eloquent eulogy. The narrator summarizes how their fame spreads and inspires: \\"To a hundred million groping, and ten times as many still in slumber, the names of Sacco and Vanzetti would be the eternal symbols of a dream, identical with civilization itself, of a human society in which wealth belongs to the producers of wealth, and the rewards of labor are to the laborers.\\" (754-5) Characters (partial list) * Cornelia Thornwell, granddaughter of an immigrant, widow of Josiah, mother of 3 daughters ** Deborah, her eldest daughter, wife of Rupert Alvin ** Alice, her daughter, wife of Henry Cabot Winters ** Clara, her youngest daughter, wife of James Scatterbridge, manager of the Thornwell family businesses * Bartolomeo Vanzetti, an Italian immigrant, anarchist * Betty Alvin, Cornelia's favorite granddaughter * Rupert Alvin, president of the Pilgrim National Bank * Henry Cabot Winters, attorney * Jerry Walker, a self-made man whose success in monopolizing the felt business in New England the Thornwells resent * Joe Randall, a Virginian, a moderate leftist, suitor to Betty * Lee Swenson, an attorney experienced in defending labor * Webster Thayer, the judge who presided at the trials NotesReferencesSources * Anthony Arthur, Radical Innocent: Upton Sinclair (NY: Random House, 2006), * Abraham Blinderman, Critics on Upton Sinclair (Coral Gables, FL: University of Miami Press, 1975) * William A.

Civil War service The U.S. Army used her as a transport during the spring and early summer of 1861, and she was purchased by the Navy at the beginning of August of that year for conversion to a warship. Commissioned as USS Alabama at the end of September 1861, in the next month she was attached to the large naval force preparing to seize Port Royal, South Carolina, for use as a base for blockading the southern seacoast. However, before that expedition reached its target area, she was detached and sent to patrol off Charleston, South Carolina. In December, Alabama took station along the Georgia coast, capturing the ship there on the 12th. For the rest of 1861 and most of 1862, Alabama continued to enforce the blockade. In February‚ÄìMarch 1862, she took part in the occupation of coastal positions in Georgia and Florida, and later played a role in the capture of at least three blockade running schooners. Alabama was under repair in October‚ÄìDecember 1862, after which she spent nearly seven months cruising in the West Indies area in search of Confederate commerce raiders. She was sent north in late July 1863 in an effort to control an outbreak of yellow fever among her crew and did not resume active service until May 1864. Alabama served with the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron for the rest of the Civil War. While off the North Carolina coast in October 1864, she assisted in the destruction of the blockade runner Annie. Late in 1864 and in January 1865, Alabama supported the attacks that finally captured Fort Fisher, thus closing the port of Wilmington, North Carolina, as a source of supplies and commerce for the Confederate cause. During March and April 1865, she operated in the vicinity of Hampton Roads and on the James River, Virginia. Her final active service was performed cruising along the mid-Atlantic coast. Post war Alabama was decommissioned at Philadelphia in mid-June 1865 and sold less than a month later. She soon resumed civilian employment, with no change in name, and remained in merchant service until destroyed by fire in 1878.

They were part of an architecture and urbanism initiative of Chairman Mao's Great Leap Forward; most of the buildings were largely completed in a time span of ten months, by the deadline of 1 October 1959.Roderick MacFarquhar. The Origins of the Cultural Revolution. Columbia University Press. 1983. v. II, p. 367. In addition to the construction of these buildings, there was also an expansion of Tiananmen square, and a campaign of art commissions to decorate the majority of the buildings by the time of their completion. Two subsequent art campaigns for these buildings were conducted in 1961, and 1964‚Äì1965.Julia F. Andrews. Painters and Politics in the People's Republic of China, 1949‚Äì1979. University of California Press. 1995. The buildings were designed by members of the Beijing Institute of Architectural Design, working with the Beijing Planning Bureau and the Ministry of Construction. The architects used an austere combination of three basic styles: modernism in the international style, Socialist realism as expressed in Stalinist architecture, and a form of historicism based on traditional Chinese architecture.Peter G. Rowe, Seng Kuan. Architectural Encounters With Essence and Form in Modern China. MIT Press. 2002. The Ten Great Buildings transformed Beijing. These monumental new buildings, constructed on a grand scale and providing modern facilities and services, helped to establish and celebrate an image of Mao Zedong's \\"New China\\". They redefined Beijing as modern and up-to-date, a part of the international socialist vision of the future, and yet still distinctively Chinese; perhaps most important, as a city comparable to other globally important \\"superpower\\" capitals such as London, Washington, D.C., and Moscow.

ÂÜõ‰∫ãÂçöÁâ©È¶ÜÁÆÄ‰ªã (Introduction to the Military Museum) Art program The art program to coincide with the construction of the Ten Great Buildings was vast in its scope‚Äîincluding some 345 paintings, murals, and sculptures to decorate the new buildings. Many were done in the modes of traditional Chinese painting, and others were in the socialist realist style. The Great Hall of the People received much of the commission's attention but the campaign was not limited to this building. One aspect of the decoration in the Great Hall was the correlation of rooms for representatives from each province with regional art by artists from these respective provinces. The artistic centerpiece of this building was a large painting by Fu Baoshi and Guan Shanyue for the main staircase. Entitled This Land So Rich in Beauty, it is one of the largest paintings on paper in China, with dimensions of 5.5 by 9 meters.Craig Clunas. Art in China. Oxford University Press. 1997. p. 213. The painting was based on the poem Ode to Snow by Mao Zedong, and includes a transcription of Mao's calligraphy of the title. Architecture The architecture of the Ten Great Buildings is a composite of factors based in modernism, communism, and historicism. Chinese architecture at the time was shaped by review of its own historical models mixed with external influences. Debate was vigorous in publications such as the Architectural Journal prior to the constructions, and history, modernity and influence were being conceptualized and reconsidered. A criticism of this initiative is that while creating facilities for political, and cultural institutions, these public projects failed to provide for a needed increase in housing,Sang Ye, Miriam Lang. China Candid: The People on the People's Republic. University of California Press. 2006. p. 76. however, a housing surge would occur in the country later in the century. Modern architecture brought to China, as it had to the west, a new economic and rational manner of building, and the modernist buildings of the group were the least decorated by the public art campaign. Examples of this are the Workers' Stadium, the Minzu Hotel, and the Overseas Chinese Hotel. The modernist tenets of function and structure were realized in these buildings, yet these were attributed both to western capitalist influences and the Soviet notion of the proletariat. The Soviet architecture inspired examples from the Ten Buildings are the Great Hall of the People, the National Museum of China, and the Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Museum. The Great Hall of the People and the National Museum of China across from it on the square continue the numerology of tens‚Äîeach having ten freestanding columns in their facades. The architectural aspects of the traditionally inspired buildings included large and heavy roofs laden with ceramic tiles. These were often stacked in multiple layers recalling the towering form of the pagoda. Another feature is upturned corners and curved ridges on hipped edges. Beneath these thick composite toppings are layers of beams, and brackets known as dougong. Examples of this type of architecture among the Ten Great Constructions are the Beijing railway station, the Nationalities Cultural Palace, and the National Agriculture Exhibition Hall.

The ship later served in the Chilean Navy. Construction and British service The steamer Thistle was launched on 2 July 1859 by Laurence Hill & Company at Port Glasgow, Scotland, for passenger and cargo service between Glasgow and Derry. She entered service for the Glasgow & Londonderry Steam Packet Company on 30 August. She was a composite- hulled (wood planking on iron frames) steamship, measured at and , and with dimensions of length, beam and depth of hold. Thistles single-screw was powered by a two-cylinder geared beam engine of 150 NHP made by A. & J. Inglis of Glasgow, and which achieved a speed of 14 knots in trials on 29 August. Blockade runner Under the name Thistle she was used as a blockade runner and in late January 1863 successfully ran through the Federal blockade into Charleston, South Carolina, a favorite port for blockade runners at the time. She ran aground while attempting to leave port a month later. The ship was salvaged, sold to another owner and renamed Cherokee. On 8 May 1863, she again attempted to an outbound passage, but was captured by . Prior to delivery to the Boston Prize Court on 7 July, she was used in the search for the Confederate raider CSS Tacony. US Navy Service After condemnation, Cherokee was purchased by the Government, outfitted at Boston Navy Yard, and commissioned 21 April 1864, Acting Volunteer Lieutenant J. F. Nickels in command. Cherokee sailed from Boston 11 May 1864, bound for duty off the coast of North Carolina with the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron. In addition to contributing to Union victory by cutting the Confederacy off from overseas sources of supply, this squadron repeatedly bombarded coastal defenses, and cooperated with the Army in amphibious expeditions up the many bays, inlets, and rivers of the serrated coast. Cherokee's operations included the capture of blockade runner Emma Henry 8 December 1864, and bombardments at Fort Fisher, North Carolina in December and January 1865. She participated in the two assaults that finally captured Fort Fisher, thus closing the port of Wilmington, N.C., to blockade-running. On 30 January she was ordered close inshore at New Inlet to reconnoiter the Half Moon Battery, where she discovered a large party of Confederates approaching the fortifications recently secured by Union troops. Cherokee threw heavy fire ashore, which drove the Confederates away after three determined rushes at the Union lines. In February 1865, Cherokee joined the East Gulf Blockading Squadron, and patrolled against blockade runners between Key West and Havana until the close of the war. Cherokee was sent north after the conclusion of the Civil War and was decommissioned at Boston 23 June 1865, and sold there 1 August 1865. Chilean Navy In 1866 Cherokee returned to civilian trades. In 1868 the steamer was sold to the Chilean Government. She served Chile's Navy for a decade under the name Ancud and spent another decade as a merchant vessel. The former Cherokee sunk off Chilo√© Island, Chile, on 25 August 1889.

A C*-subalgebra B of A is a hereditary C*-subalgebra if for all a ‚àà A and b ‚àà B such that 0 ‚â§ a ‚â§ b, we have a ‚àà B.  Properties  * A hereditary C*-subalgebra of an approximately finite-dimensional C*-algebra is also AF. This is not true for subalgebras that are not hereditary. For instance, every abelian C*-algebra can be embedded into an AF C*-algebra. * A C*-subalgebra is called full if it is not contained in any proper (two-sided) closed ideal. Two C*-algebras A and B are called stably isomorphic if A ‚äó K ‚âÖ B ‚äó K, where K is the C*-algebra of compact operators on a separable infinite- dimensional Hilbert space. C*-algebras are stably isomorphic to their full hereditary C*-subalgebras. Hence, two C*-algebras are stably isomorphic if they contain stably isomorphic full hereditary C*-subalgebras. * Also hereditary C*-subalgebras are those C*-subalgebras in which the restriction of any irreducible representation is also irreducible.  Correspondence with closed left ideals  There is a bijective correspondence between closed left ideals and hereditary C*-subalgebras of A. If L ‚äÇ A is a closed left ideal, let L* denote the image of L under the *-operation. The set L* is a right ideal and L* ‚à© L is a C*-subalgebra. In fact, L* ‚à© L is hereditary and the map L L* ‚à© L is a bijection. It follows from this correspondence that every closed ideal is a hereditary C*-subalgebra. Another corollary is that a hereditary C*-subalgebra of a simple C*-algebra is also simple.  Connections with positive elements  If p is a projection of A (or a projection of the multiplier algebra of A), then pAp is a hereditary C*-subalgebra known as a corner of A. More generally, given a positive a ‚àà A, the closure of the set aAa is the smallest hereditary C*-subalgebra containing a, denoted by Her(a). If A is separable, then every hereditary C*-subalgebra has this form. These hereditary C*-subalgebras can bring some insight into the notion of Cuntz subequivalence. In particular, if a and b are positive elements of a C*-algebra A, then a \\\\precsim b if and only if b ‚àà Her(a). Hence, a ~ b if and only if Her(a) = Her(b). If A is unital and the positive element a is invertible, then Her(a) = A. This suggests the following notion for the non- unital case: a ‚àà A is said to be strictly positive if Her(a) = A. For example, in the C*-algebra K(H) of compact operators acting on Hilbert space H, a compact operator is strictly positive if and only if its range is dense in H. A commutative C*-algebra contains a strictly positive element if and only if the spectrum of the algebra is œÉ-compact. More generally, a C*-algebra contains a strictly positive element if and only if the algebra has a sequential approximate identity.

Outfitted as a gunboat, she was commissioned in August 1864 and, following a brief search off the Atlantic Coast for the Confederate raider CSS Tallahassee, joined the blockading forces off North Carolina. Eolus patrolled the coast, rivers, and sounds of North Carolina, enforcing the blockade and acting as picket. She carried men, messages, mail, supplies, orders, and ammunition to the large ships of the squadron and transferred their wounded to hospital ships. During October 1864 she captured the blockade runner Hope and assisted in the capture of the Lady Sterling. Late in the year and in mid-January 1865 Eolus took part in the attacks that captured Fort Fisher, thus closing the port of Wilmington to blockade runners. She continued operations in North Carolina waters from then until after the Civil War's end. Civilian service In June 1865, Eolus went north to Boston, Massachusetts, for decommissioning.

It is found in rivers of the Atlantic slope of southern Mexico, Belize, and Guatemala. Taxonomy In 2015, McMahan et al. published a paper placing this species in the genus Trichromis. The relationship of Salvin's cichlid to other Central American cichlid had long been debated. Genetic research by ≈ò√≠ƒçan et al. revealed that the closest relatives to Trichromis are the firemouth cichlid and its congeners in the genus Thorichthys. Description The Salvin's cichlid is oblong in shape and has a rather pointed mouth compared to other Central American cichlids. The body is yellow with two lines of black \\"flowers\\" along the side and upper half of the back of the fish. These flowers have a blue pearl outline. It has black bars that cross the face, and both sexes have red bellies, which is more pronounced in females, especially when ready to spawn. Females also have a patch in the center of the dorsal fin and a spot on the lower part of the gill cover. Females are smaller than males. Males are duller in color and have longer, more pointed fins. Both male and female become more vibrant during breeding.  Distribution  Salvin's cichlid is found along the eastern coastal rivers and lagoons at lower elevations of Central America, from Mexico south to Honduras. This species is introduced in South Florida. The species prefers moderate to fast flowing currents. Dietary Habits Salvin's cichlid is a piscivore. It uses slight jaw protrusion to exploit prey located near riverbeds. Their 8.2% jaw protrusion only allows them to consume 48% of evasive prey. This species prefers using its jaw protrusion to gouge out the eyes of its prey before devouring it. Reproduction The female takes a more active role in initiating breeding and caring for fry than the male.  Aquarium specimens = Care Requirements  Salvin's cichlid is a very hardy fish, preferring temperatures between . They prefer a higher pH of around 8.0, and require the space of at least a tank. They grow to approximately in length and are quite aggressive toward other fish, but moderate aggressive towards same species. They require rocks and logs to hide in, and open swimming space.  Feeding  Salvin's cichlid accepts a wide variety of foods.

Remembering Ourselves: On Some Countercultural Echoes of Contemporary Tantric Studies. Religions of South Asia 1.1: 11-28. He met Hamati in Lincoln, Nebraska in the late 1880s and they travelled together. Hamati taught Bernard body-control techniques of hatha yoga. After several years of study, Bernard was able to put himself into deep trance, so his body could be pierced with long surgical needles.Weir, David. (2011). American Orient: Imagining the East from the Colonial Era through the Twentieth Century. University of Massachusetts Press. p. 252. He gave a public demonstration of what he termed the \\"Kali Mudra\\", a simulating death trance in January, 1898 to a group of physicians in San Francisco. During the demonstration Dr. D. McMillan inserted a surgical needle \\"slowly through one of Bernard's earlobes\\". Needles were also pushed through his cheek, upper lip and nostril. Bernard was featured on January 29, 1898, on the front page of The New York Times. Bernard took interest in hypnotism. In 1905, he founded the Bacchante Academy with Mortimer K. Hargis to teach hypnotism and sexual practices. The organization declined because of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and their partnership dissolved.Melton, J. Gordon. (1999).

He eventually expanded to a chain of tantric clinics in places such as Cleveland, Philadelphia, Chicago, and New York City. Bernard is widely credited with being the first American to introduce the philosophy and practices of yoga and tantra to the American people. He also played a critical role in establishing a greatly exaggerated association of tantra with the use of sex for mystical purposes in the American mindset. Pierre Bernard demonstrating the \\"Kali Mudra\\" death trance. In 1910, two teenage girls, Zella Hopp and Gertrude Leo, feeling that he had taken too much psychic control over their lives, had him charged with kidnapping (alleging that Leo had been prevented three times from leaving the institute) and briefly imprisoned. Hopp reported that, for a pre-induction, Bernard had her strip and placed his hand upon her left breast, explaining that he was testing her heartbeat. \\"I cannot tell you how Bernard got his control over me or how he gets it over other people. He is the most wonderful man in the world. No women seem able to resist him.... He had promised to marry me many times. But when he began the same thing with my little sister [Mary, age sixteen] I decided I would expose the whole matter. If it had only been myself I wouldn't have done it for the whole world.\\" Three months later, the charges were dropped. He remained popular with upper middle class women and the high society of New York throughout the 1920s and 30s. He married Blanche de Vries, who taught yoga in New York into her eighties, combining yoga with Eastern-inspired sensual dance and contributing to a shift in attitudes about women's autonomy and sexuality. Historian of religion Robert C. Fuller, has commented that Bernard's \\"sexual teachings generated such scandal that he was eventually forced to discontinue his public promulgation of Tantrism. Yet by this time Bernard had succeeded in making lasting contributions to the history of American alternative spirituality.\\"Fuller, Robert C. (2008). Spirituality in the Flesh: Bodily Sources of Religious Experiences. Oxford University Press. p. 125.

The last execution for piracy in the United States was of slave trader Nathaniel Gordon in 1862 in New York, under the amended act. History=Background The original act, passed in 1819, was officially known as \\"An act to protect the commerce of the United States and punish the crime of piracy\\" (), and provided in section 5 that \\"That if any person or persons whatsoever shall, on the high seas, commit the crime of piracy, as defined by the law of nations, and such offender or offenders shall afterwards be brought into or found in the United States, every such offender or offenders shall, upon conviction thereof ... be punished by death.\\" Section 6 set the act to expire at \\"the end of the next session of Congress\\". This original 1819 act was amended by \\"An Act to continue in force 'An act to protect the commerce of the United States and punish the crime of piracy', and also to make further provisions for punishing the crime of piracy\\" (), sometimes known as the \\"1820 Piracy Law.\\" It extended the original act to 2 years after, then to the end of the next session of Congress after that. It also added three types of piracy: * in section 3, robbery of a ship, its crew, or contents is declared piracy, punishable by death; * in section 4, to seize or \\"decoy\\" onto a ship \\"any negro or mulatto, not held to service or labour by the laws of either of the states or territories of the United States with intent to make such negro or mulatto a slave\\" is also declared piracy punishable by death; and * in section 5, attempting to confine, deliver, or sell a negro or mulatto (similarly qualified as \\"not held to service\\", etc.) is also declared piracy punishable by death. The act was made \\"perpetual\\" by the 17th United States Congress (). James Smith trial of 1854 In November 1854 New York County District Attorney John McKeon arraigned James Smith, the captain of the American ship Julia Moulton, for having violated the anti-piracy act of 1820 when he hauled 645 slaves from Ambriz to the island of Trinidad.Hugh Thomas, The Slave Trade: The Story of the Atlantic Slave Trade: 1440-1870. New York: Simon and Schuster, 1997; pg. 763. Despite his protestations that his real name was Julius Schmidt, a native of Hanover, Germany, and not a naturalized American citizen ‚Äî and thus not subject to American law ‚Äî Smith became the first person to be convicted under the 1820 anti-piracy provisions, which called for a sentence of death. Upon appeal a mistrial was declared, based upon various legal technicalities, with the result that Smith was released from jail having served 32 months. Nathanial Gordon trial of 1862 Nathaniel Gordon was the only American slave trader to be tried, convicted, and executed \\"for being engaged in the Slave Trade\\" under this law. He was hung in New York on February 21, 1862. See also *United States v.

Gaelic Football is very popular in the Parish of Adare. Adare have reached the county senior hurling final on 12 occasions, most recently in 2013 when they lost to Na Piarsaigh. After losing the finals of 1968, 1986, 1990, 1993 and 1996, they finally won their first championship in 2001 and successfully defended it in 2002. In 2003 they narrowly missed out on winning three county titles in a row after losing out to Patrickswell in the final. They also won the title in 2007 and 2008. In 2009 they completed an historic 3 in a row. In 2010 they surrendered their County title to Na Piarsaigh at the quarter final stage. 2008 marked their first win in the Munster Senior Club Hurling Championship when they overcame Toomevara. They were subsequently defeated in the Munster final by De La Salle. Another notable success in 2008 was the completion of a \\"clean sweep\\" of county B√≥rd na n√ìg hurling finals, winning the under 12, under 14 and under 16 titles. Recently, Football has developed to the more successful code in the parish. In 2016, in their first year after relegation from senior level, The Club won the County Intermediate Football Title, and subsequently gained promotion back to The Limerick Senior Football Championship. In 2017, the senior side won the County Senior Title for the first time, beating Newcastle West in the Final. In 2018, the club went on to retain the title, becoming the first team in history to win 2 senior titles immediately following success at intermediate level. Prior to this, Adare had only reached two senior finals, the first in 2002, where they were defeated after a replay by Monaleen. Their second senior final appearance was in 2010, where once again they were defeated by Monaleen. The village regularly enjoys success at underage level in both codes. Notable players Declan Hannon and Wayne McNamara are current members of the Limerick senior hurling team, and in 2013 were part of the team that won Limerick's first Munster title in 17 years. Mark Foley has played in 2 all Ireland finals and won 2 all-stars in 1996 and 2001. In 1996 Foley won young player of the year. He was captain of the Limerick senior team in 2002, 2003, 2008 and 2009. In 2009, he became Limerick's most \\"capped\\" ever player when he reached a record 47 senior championship appearances for the county.

Early life Born in Coru√±a del Conde, Mar√≠n became the head of his household after his father died and had to take care of his seven siblings. He worked as an agricultural laborer, tending his animals and fields. Mar√≠n spent long afternoons and days herding sheep in the surrounding fields. Inventions Early on, Marin devised several labor-saving devices, including a device that improved the functionality of a watermill on the Arandilla river; one that improved the working of a fulling-mill; and another used to improve the cutting of marble in the quarries of Espej√≥n. He also came up with a device used to whip horses during the process of threshing, and another that made cloth pads. Flying machine Mar√≠n was inspired by the eagles he spotted while tending his animals and fields: he wanted to build a flying machine. For six years, he worked on one he invented. The machine was built out of wood, iron, cloth, and feathers. He gathered eagle and vulture feathers by setting up special traps on which he placed rotting meat to attract these birds. Mar√≠n made calculations regarding the weight, volume, size, dimensions of the feathers, as well as the weight of the bodies of these birds. He also carefully studied the movement of their wings and tail and, with the assistance of the local blacksmith, Joaqu√≠n Barbero, constructed a pair of wrought iron \\"joints\\" that moved about like a fan. He also built stirrups for his feet and hand-cranks that controlled the direction of the flying machine. Attempted flight On the night of May 15, 1793, accompanied by the blacksmith Barbero and one of Mar√≠n's sisters, Mar√≠n placed his glider on the highest part of the castle of Coru√±a del Conde. In the light of the full moon, he remarked (roughly): \\"I'm going to Burgo de Osma, and from there to Soria, and I'll be back in a couple of days.\\" Flapping the wings of the glider, he reached a height of \\"six or seven varas\\" (approximately 5 or 6 m) and according to his companions, glided for \\"431 Castilian varas\\", or approximately 300 to 400 metres. The American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics writes that he flew for ‚Äúabout 360 meters.‚Äù Mar√≠n managed to cross the river Arandilla and reached the area known as Heras, where he crash- landed after one of the metal joints broke. Fearing the worst, his companions ran to the spot. Mar√≠n was only scratched and bruised, but angry at the blacksmith for failing to weld the joint properly. Death and legacy Mar√≠n suffered further bad luck. The inhabitants of the town, believing him to be a lunatic, heretic, or a fraud, burned his \\"demonic\\" flapping-wing creation. Mar√≠n lost all hope and, feeling disgraced and deeply depressed, never attempted flight again. He died at the age of 44 in his native town, six years after his attempted flight. Mar√≠n left no documentation regarding his inventions and he was buried at the local church. Now called the ‚Äúfather of aviation‚Äù in Spain, the Spanish Air Force dedicated a monument to him that is located next to the castle where he took flight. The castle was offered for sale for ‚Ç¨1 in 2002, on the condition that the buyer restore the crumbling building. Of Mar√≠n, the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics writes: \\"It is impossible to determine how much truth there is to the story of Mar√≠n, but it seems that he did achieve some gliding flight, surviving after structural failure and a crash landing. Mar√≠n, who had no formal scientific education, was endowed with a special technical ingenuity and is a good example of the ageless human aspiration toward flight.\\" They credit him with a flight of approximately 360 meters.

After his UN tenure, de Boer was Global Chairman of Climate Change and Sustainability Services at KPMG. From 2014 to 2016 de Boer was Director-General of the Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI), a Seoul- based international environmental organization.  Life  De Boer was born in Vienna on 12 June 1954. He holds a technical degree in social work from the Netherlands. De Boer is married and has three children.  Career  De Boer has been involved in climate change policies since 1994, most notably helping to prepare the position of the European Union in the lead-up to the negotiations on the Kyoto Protocol. Since then, de Boer has sought broad stakeholder involvement on the issues of climate change and public policy. To that end, he launched an international dialogue on the Clean Development Mechanism and has partnered international discussions with the World Business Council on Sustainable Development, aimed at increasing private sector involvement. De Boer was Director for International Affairs of the Ministry of Housing, Spatial Planning and Environment of the Netherlands, also working for the United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-HABITAT) earlier in his career. In 2006 he was appointed by then Secretary-General Kofi Annan as Executive Director of the UNFCCC; in 2010 he resigned.

Specifically, it emphasizes the importance of rigorous foundations based on microeconomics, especially rational expectations. New classical macroeconomics strives to provide neoclassical microeconomic foundations for macroeconomic analysis. This is in contrast with its rival new Keynesian school that uses microfoundations such as price stickiness and imperfect competition to generate macroeconomic models similar to earlier, Keynesian ones.Chapter 1. Snowdon, Brian and Vane, Howard R., (2005). Modern Macroeconomics: Its Origin, Development and Current State. Edward Elgar Publishing,  History  Classical economics is the term used for the first modern school of economics. The publication of Adam Smith's The Wealth of Nations in 1776 is considered to be the birth of the school. Perhaps the central idea behind it is on the ability of the market to be self- correcting as well as being the most superior institution in allocating resources. The central assumption implied is that all individuals maximize their utility. The so-called marginal revolution that occurred in Europe in the late 19th century, led by Carl Menger, William Stanley Jevons, and L√©on Walras, gave rise to what is known as neoclassical economics. This neoclassical formulation had also been formalized by Alfred Marshall. However, it was the general equilibrium of Walras that helped solidify the research in economic science as a mathematical and deductive enterprise, the essence of which is still neoclassical and makes up what is currently found in mainstream economics textbooks to this day. The neoclassical school dominated the field up until the Great Depression of the 1930s. Then, however, with the publication of The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money by John Maynard Keynes in 1936, certain neoclassical assumptions were rejected. Keynes proposed an aggregated framework to explain macroeconomic behavior, leading thus to the current distinction between micro- and macroeconomics. Of particular importance in Keynes' theories was his explanation of economic behavior as also being led by \\"animal spirits\\". In this sense, it limited the role for the so-called rational (maximizing) agent. The Post-World War II period saw the widespread implementation of Keynesian economic policy in the United States and Western European countries. Its dominance in the field by the 1970s was best reflected by the controversial statement attributed to US President Richard Nixon and economist Milton Friedman: \\"We are all Keynesians now\\". Problems arose during the 1973‚Äì75 recession triggered by the 1973 oil crisis. Keynesian policy responses did not reduce unemployment, instead leading to a period of high inflation and stagnant economic growth‚Äîstagflation. Keynesians were puzzled by the outbreak of stagflation because the original Phillips curve ruled out concurrent high inflation and high unemployment.  Emergence in response to stagflation  The New Classical school emerged in the 1970s as a response to the failure of Keynesian economics to explain stagflation. New Classical and monetarist criticisms led by Robert Lucas, Jr. and Milton Friedman respectively forced the rethinking of Keynesian economics. In particular, Lucas made the Lucas critique that cast doubt on the Keynesian model. This strengthened the case for macro models to be based on microeconomics. After the 1970s and the apparent failure of Keynesian economics, the New Classical school for a while became the dominant school in Macroeconomics. New neoclassical synthesis Prior to the late 1990s, macroeconomics was split between new Keynesian work on market imperfections demonstrated with small models and new classical work on real business cycle theory that used fully specified general equilibrium models and used changes in technology to explain fluctuations in economic output. The new neoclassical synthesis developed as a consensus on the best way to explain short-run fluctuations in the economy. The new synthesis took elements from both schools. New classical economics contributed the methodology behind real business cycle theory and new Keynesian economics contributed nominal rigidities (slow moving and periodic, rather than continuous, price changes also called sticky prices). The new synthesis provides the theoretical foundation for much of contemporary mainstream economics.Woodford, Michael. Convergence in Macroeconomics: Elements of the New Synthesis.

No. 98‚Äì5. http://www.richmondfed.org/publications/research/working_papers/1998/pdf/wp98-5.pdf.  Analytic method  The new classical perspective takes root in three diagnostic sources of fluctuations in growth: the productivity wedge, the capital wedge, and the labor wedge. Through the neoclassical perspective and business cycle accounting one can look at the diagnostics and find the main ‚Äòculprits‚Äô for fluctuations in the real economy. * A productivity/efficiency wedge is a simple measure of aggregate production efficiency. In relation to the Great Depression, a productivity wedge means the economy is less productive given the capital and labor resources available in the economy. * A capital wedge is a gap between the intertemporal marginal rate of substitution in consumption and the marginal product of capital. In this wedge, there‚Äôs a ‚Äúdeadweight‚Äù loss that affects capital accumulation and savings decisions acting as a distortionary capital (savings) tax. * A labor wedge is the ratio between the marginal rate of substitution of consumption for leisure and the marginal product of labor and acts as a distortionary labor tax, making hiring workers less profitable (i.e. labor market frictions).  Foundation and assumptions  New classical economics is based on Walrasian assumptions. All agents are assumed to maximize utility on the basis of rational expectations. At any one time, the economy is assumed to have a unique equilibrium at full employment or potential output achieved through price and wage adjustment. In other words, the market clears at all times. New classical economics has also pioneered the use of representative agent models. Such models have received severe neoclassical criticism, pointing to the disjuncture between microeconomic behavior and macroeconomic results, as indicated by Alan Kirman. The concept of rational expectations was originally used by John Muth, and was popularized by Lucas. One of the most famous new classical models is the real business cycle model, developed by Edward C. Prescott and Finn E. Kydland.  Legacy  It turned out that pure new classical models had low explanatory and predictive power. The models could not simultaneously explain both the duration and magnitude of actual cycles. Additionally, the model's key result that only unexpected changes in money can affect the business cycle and unemployment did not stand empirical tests.Mark Thoma, New Classical, New Keynesian, and Real Business Cycle Models, Economist's View The mainstream turned to the new neoclassical synthesis.Woodford, Michael.

No. 98‚Äì5. http://www.richmondfed.org/publications/research/working_papers/1998/pdf/wp98-5.pdf. Most economists, even most new classical economists, accepted the new Keynesian notion that for several reasons wages and prices do not move quickly and smoothly to the values needed for long-run equilibrium between quantities supplied and demanded. Therefore, they also accept the monetarist and new Keynesian view that monetary policy can have a considerable effect in the short run.Kevin Hoover (2008). \\"New Classical Macroeconomics\\", econlib.org The new classical macroeconomics contributed the rational expectations hypothesis and the idea of intertemporal optimisation to new Keynesian economics and the new neoclassical synthesis. Peter Galb√°cs thinks that critics have a superficial and incomplete understanding of the new classical macroeconomics. He argues that one should not forget the conditional character of the new classical doctrines. If prices are completely flexible and if public expectations are completely rational and if real economic shocks are white noises, monetary policy cannot affect unemployment or production and any intention to control the real economy ends up only in a change in the rate of inflation. However, and this is the point, if any of these conditions does not hold, monetary policy can be effective again. So, if any of the conditions necessary for the equivalence does not hold, countercyclical fiscal policy can be effective. Controlling the real economy is possible perhaps in a Keynesian style if government regains its potential to exert this control. Therefore, actually, new classical macroeconomics highlights the conditions under which economic policy can be effective and not the predestined inefficiency of economic policy. Countercyclical aspirations need not to be abandoned, only the playing-field of economic policy got narrowed by new classicals. While Keynes urged active countercyclical efforts of fiscal policy, these efforts are not predestined to fail not even in the new classical theory, only the conditions necessary for the efficiency of countercyclical efforts were specified by new classicals. Real business cycle theorist Bernd Lucke calls the new classical macroeconomics model the ‚Ä≥caricature of an economy\\" because its underlying assumptions exclude any non-rational behaviour or the possibility of market failure, prices are always fully flexible, and the market is always in economic equilibrium. The current mission of the new classical macroeconomics is to find out to which extent this caricature of an economy already has enough predictive power to explain business cycles.University of Hamburg, Bernd Lucke, Die Real-Business-Cycle Theorie und ihre Relevanz f√ºr die Konjunkturanalyse  See also  * Neoclassical synthesis  References  Further reading    External links  * Category:Schools of economic thought ","title":"New classical macroeconomics"},{"id":"13437205","text":"Alligator River is a small river in eastern North Carolina, separating Dare County and Tyrrell County.

He is currently Professor of Philosophy at University of Copenhagen and University of Oxford. Biography Dan Zahavi was born in Copenhagen, Denmark to an Israeli father and a Danish mother. He initially studied phenomenology at the University of Copenhagen. He obtained his PhD in 1994 from the Husserl Archives at the Katholieke Universiteit in Leuven, Belgium, with Rudolf Bernet as his doctoral supervisor. In 1999 he defended his Danish Disputats (Habilitation) at the University of Copenhagen. In 2002, at the age of 34, he became Professor of Philosophy and Director of the Center for Subjectivity Research at the University of Copenhagen. In 2018, he also became Professor of Philosophy at University of Oxford. Philosophical work Zahavi writes on phenomenology (especially the philosophy of Edmund Husserl) and philosophy of mind. In his writings, he has dealt extensively with topics such as self, self- consciousness, intersubjectivity and social cognition. He is co-editor of the journal Phenomenology and the Cognitive Sciences. Zahavi's work has been translated into more than 30 languages. Pre-reflective self- consciousness In several books and articles, Zahavi has defended the existence and significance of pre-reflective self-consciousness, and argued in favor of the idea that our experiential life is characterized by a form of self-consciousness that is more primitive and more fundamental than the reflective form of self-consciousness that one finds in various kinds of introspection. More generally speaking, Zahavi has spoken out against different reductionist approaches to consciousness, and insisted on the theoretical significance of subjectivity and the first-person perspective. In working on these issues, Zahavi has collaborated and debated with psychiatrists, developmental psychologists, and Buddhist scholars. Critics have included those who either deny the existence of self or the existence of pre-reflective self-consciousness. Empathy and social cognition Another part of Zahavi's work has focused on problems related to intersubjectivity, empathy, and social cognition. His PhD thesis defended a phenomenological approach to intersubjectivity. In various papers and books since then he has in particular focused on the role and structure of empathy. He has argued in favor of the bodily and contextual character of interpersonal understanding, and criticized dominant positions within the so-called ‚Äôtheory of mind‚Äô debate, including simulation theory and theory-theory. Shame and collective intentionality Since 2010, Zahavi has worked increasingly on social emotions and on issues in social ontology. He has written on shame, on shared emotions, we-experiences, collective intentionality, and the importance of the I‚Äìthou relation. Phenomenology In parallel with his systematic work on the above-mentioned topics, Zahavi has also written on phenomenology, especially the work of Edmund Husserl. He has argued that phenomenology is a powerful and systematically convincing voice that contemporary philosophy and empirical science shouldn‚Äôt ignore. In addition to offering extensive analyses of Husserl‚Äôs analyses of intersubjectivity and self- and time-consciousness, Zahavi has also discussed the nature of Husserl‚Äôs transcendental philosophy and the metaphysical implications of phenomenology in various publications. Throughout his work, Zahavi has criticized what he takes to be overly simplistic interpretations of Husserl that depicts the latter as a solipsist and subjective idealist, and instead accentuated the continuity between Husserl‚Äôs phenomenology and the work of post-Husserlian phenomenologists, especially that of Merleau-Ponty. Center for Subjectivity Research Zahavi is the director of the Center for Subjectivity Research (CFS), established in 2002 on the basis of funding from the Danish National Research Foundation. Since 2002, CFS has been working on topics related to selfhood and sociality and has actively promoted a research strategy involving collaboration between different philosophical tradition and between philosophy and empirical science, in particular psychiatry. After the expiration of the funding from the Danish National Research Foundation in 2012, CFS has continued its research with support from a variety of both Danish and European public and private foundations. Since 2010, CFS has organized an annual summer school in phenomenology and philosophy of mind that typically attracts around 100 students from all over the world. Honors and awards Zahavi has received a number of honors and awards, including: * The Edward Goodwin Ballard Prize in Phenomenology (2000) * The Silver Medal from the Danish Royal Society of Sciences and Letters (2000) * Elected member of Institut International de Philosophie in 2001 * The Elite Research Prize of the Danish Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation (2006). The award is given to outstanding young researchers of the highest international standard, which have made an extraordinary contribution to strengthen Danish research. * Elected member of the Danish Royal Society of Sciences and Letters in 2007 * The Carlsberg Foundation's Research Prize (2011) from the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters. The prize was awarded in connection with the 200 year anniversary of brewer J.C.

Surveys may be conducted by phone, mail, via the internet, and sometimes face-to-face on busy street corners or in malls. Surveys are used to increase knowledge in fields such as social research and demography. Survey research is often used to assess thoughts, opinions, and feelings. Surveys can be specific and limited, or they can have more global, widespread goals. Psychologists and sociologists often use surveys to analyze behavior, while it is also used to meet the more pragmatic needs of the media, such as, in evaluating political candidates, public health officials, professional organizations, and advertising and marketing directors. Survey research has also been employed in various medical and surgical fields to gather information about healthcare personnel‚Äôs practice patterns and professional attitudes toward various clinical problems and diseases. Healthcare professionals that may be enrolled in survey studies in include physicians, nurses, and physical therapists among others. A survey consists of a predetermined set of questions that is given to a sample. With a representative sample, that is, one that is representative of the larger population of interest, one can describe the attitudes of the population from which the sample was drawn. Further, one can compare the attitudes of different populations as well as look for changes in attitudes over time. A good sample selection is key as it allows one to generalize the findings from the sample to the population, which is the whole purpose of survey research. Types=Census A census is the procedure of systematically acquiring and recording information about the members of a specific given population. It is a regularly occurring and official count of a particular population. The term is used mostly in connection with national population and housing censuses; other common censuses include agriculture, business, and traffic censuses. The United Nations defines the essential features of population and housing censuses as \\"individual enumeration, universality within a defined territory, simultaneity and defined periodicity\\", and recommends that population censuses be taken at least every 10 years. Other household surveys Other surveys than the census may explore characteristics in households, such as fertility, family structure, and demographics. Household surveys with at least 10,000 participants include: *General Household Survey, conducted in private households in Great Britain. It is a repeated cross- sectional study, conducted annually, which uses a sample of 9,731 households in the 2006 survey. *Generations and Gender Survey, conducted in several countries in Europe as well as Australia and Japan. The programme has collected least one wave of surveys in 19 countries, with an average of 9,000 respondents per country. *Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia Survey, where the wave 1 panel consisted of 7,682 households and 19,914 individuals *Integrated Household Survey, a survey made up of multiple other surveys in the UK. It includes about 340,000 respondents, making it the largest collection of social data in the UK after the census.Integrated Household Survey *National Survey of Family Growth, conducted in the United States by the National Center for Health Statistics division of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to understand trends related to fertility, family structure, and demographics in the United States. The 2006-2010 NSFG surveyed 22,682 interviews. *Panel Study of Income Dynamics in the United States, wherein data have been collected from the same families and their descendants since 1968. The study started with over 18,000 nationally representative individuals. It involved more than 9,000 individuals as of 2009. *Socio-Economic Panel, a longitudinal panel dataset of the population in Germany. It is a household-based study that started in 1984 and which reinterviews adult household members annually. In 2007, the study involved about 12,000 households, with more than 20,000 adult persons sampled. *UK households: a longitudinal study, now known as Understanding Society.Understandingsociety.org.uk Its sample size is 40,000 households from the United Kingdom or approx. 100,000 individuals. Opinion poll November 3, 1948: President Harry S. Truman, shortly after being elected as President, smiles as he holds up a copy of the Chicago Tribune issue predicting his electoral defeat. This image has become iconic of the consequences of bad polling data. An opinion poll is a survey of public opinion from a particular sample. Opinion polls are usually designed to represent the opinions of a population by conducting a series of questions and then extrapolating generalities in ratio or within confidence intervals. Healthcare surveys Medical or health-related survey research is particularly concerned with uncovering knowledge-practice gaps. That is to say to reveal any inconsistencies between the established international recommended guidelines and the real time medical practice regarding a certain disease or clinical problem. In other words, some medical surveys aim at exploring the difference between the proper practice and the actual practice reported by the healthcare professionals. Medical survey research has also been used to collect information from the patients, caregivers and even the public on relevant health issues. In turn the information gathered from survey results can be used to upgrade the professional performance of healthcare personnel including physicians, develop the quality of healthcare delivered to patients, mend existing deficiencies of the healthcare delivery system and professional health education. Furthermore, the results of survey research can inform the public health domain and help conduct health awareness campaigns in vulnerable populations and guide healthcare policy-makers. This is especially true when survey research deals with a wide spread disease that constitutes a nationwide or global health challenge. Methodology A single survey is made of at least a sample (or full population in the case of a census), a method of data collection (e.g., a questionnaire) and individual questions or items that become data that can be analyzed statistically. A single survey may focus on different types of topics such as preferences (e.g., for a presidential candidate), opinions (e.g., should abortion be legal?), behavior (smoking and alcohol use), or factual information (e.g., income), depending on its purpose. Since survey research is almost always based on a sample of the population, the success of the research is dependent on the representativeness of the sample with respect to a target population of interest to the researcher. That target population can range from the general population of a given country to specific groups of people within that country, to a membership list of a professional organization, or list of students enrolled in a school system (see also sampling (statistics) and survey sampling). Interpretation=Correlation and causality When two variables are related, or correlated, one can make predictions for these two variables. However, it is important to note that this does not mean causality. At this point, it is not possible to determine a causal relationship between the two variables; correlation does not imply causality. However, correlation evidence is significant because it can help identify potential causes of behavior. Path analysis is a statistical technique that can be used with correlational data. This involves the identification of mediator and moderator variables. A mediator variable is used to explain the correlation between two variables. A moderator variable affects the direction or strength of the correlation between two variables. A spurious relationship is a relationship in which the relation between two variables can be explained by a third variable. Moreover, in survey research, correlation coefficients between two variables might be affected by measurement error, what can lead to wrongly estimated coefficients and biased substantive conclusions. Therefore, when using survey data, we need to correct correlation coefficients for measurement error. Reported behavior versus actual behavior The value of collected data completely depends upon how truthful respondents are in their answers on questionnaires. In general, survey researchers accept respondents‚Äô answers as true. Survey researchers avoid reactive measurement by examining the accuracy of verbal reports, and directly observing respondents‚Äô behavior in comparison with their verbal reports to determine what behaviors they really engage in or what attitudes they really uphold. Studies examining the association between self-reports (attitudes, intentions) and actual behavior show that the link between them‚Äîthrough positive‚Äîis not always strong‚Äîthus caution is needed when extrapolating self-reports to actual behaviors,Morwitz, Vicki G., and David Schmittlein. \\"Using segmentation to improve sales forecasts based on purchase intent: Which\\" intenders\\" actually buy?.\\" Journal of Marketing Research (1992): 391-405.Chandon, Pierre, Vicki G. Morwitz, and Werner J. Reinartz. \\"Do intentions really predict behavior?

Dishonesty is pronounced in some sex-related queries, with men often amplifying their number of sex partners, while women tend to downplay and slash their true number.Wiederman, Michael W. \\"The truth must be in here somewhere: Examining the gender discrepancy in self‚Äêreported lifetime number of sex partners.\\" Journal of Sex Research 34.4 (1997): 375-386. History The Statistical Society of London pioneered the questionnaire in 1838. \\"Among the earliest acts of the Statistical Society of London ... was the appointment of committees to enquire into industrial and social conditions. One of these committees, in 1838, used the first written questionnaire of which I have any record. The committee-men prepared and printed a list of questions 'designed to elicit the complete and impartial history of strikes.'\\" The most famous public survey in the United States of America is the national census. Held every ten years since 1790, the census attempts to count all persons, and also to obtain demographic data about factors such as household income, ethnicity, and religion. Nielsen ratings (carried out since 1947) provide another example of public surveys in the United States. Nielsen rating track media-viewing habits (radio, television, internet, print) the results of which are used to make decisions by and about the mass media. Some Nielsen ratings localize the data points to give marketing firms more specific information with which to target customers. Demographic data is also used to understand what influences work best to market consumer products, political campaigns, etc. Following the invention of the telephone survey (used at least as early as the 1940s), the development of the Internet in the late-20th century fostered online surveys and web surveys.

So far, Hendrix biographers have identified only two songs he recorded with Richard, but are uncertain about the dates: \\"I Don't Know What You've Got (But It's Got Me)\\", a two-part single released by Vee-Jay Records in November 1965, and \\"Dancing All Around the World\\". Neither song appears on this album, although they are included on the West Coast Seattle Boy: The Jimi Hendrix Anthology (2010). In July 1965, Hendrix played guitar during a WLAC-TV television appearance by Upsetters backup singers Buddy & Stacy. They performed the Junior Walker hit \\"Shotgun\\", which was broadcast on Night Train, a Nashville, Tennessee, music variety show. Soon thereafter, Hendrix moved to New York City, where he sent a postcard to his father: Richard's brother, Robert Penniman, later claimed that Hendrix was fired because \\"he was always late for the bus and flirting with all the girls and stuff like that.\\" ReferencesExternal links * Category:1972 albums Category:Little Richard albums ","title":"Friends from the Beginning ‚Äì Little Richard and Jimi Hendrix"},{"id":"13437571","text":"The following is a list of characters from the Hong Kong drama television series A Kindred Spirit.

Outspoken and direct, she has no qualms about voicing her frank opinions that frequently engages her mother-in-law Grandma Ga in verbal arguments. She also frequently nags at Ah Choi, causing Ah Choi to be rather frustrated with their marriage. Devastated by Ah Choi's infidelity, she nearly filed for divorce. Fortunately, she found out that she was pregnant with a male son that the family and Ah Choi had long been yearning for, and that led to her finally forgiving Ah Choi. *Ah Fuk Èòø Á¶è (Full name Lee Tim Fuk ÊùéÊ∑ªÁ¶è. Played by Ram Chiang)- Son of Bing and Auntie Shin. He is the only uneducated son in the family due to a lack of financial resources, and this has made Auntie Shin and Bing feel guilty from time to time. He helps out his parents in their restaurant. His wife Wing Kum is highly protective of him and their son, Lok Lok. His gullibility has led him into troubles in the series from time to time, including marrying his second wife (a scheming woman from the mainland) after Wing Kum died. *Wing Kum Ë©†Áê¥ or Ah Kum Èòø Áê¥ (Full name Chan Wing Kum Èô≥Ë©†Áê¥. Played by Louisa So)- The daughter-in-law of the Lee family. Wing works at a spa and is sometimes giving facials. She died after donating her liver to her son Lok Lok. Her death was an extremely tragic arc in the show, even more so than Choi Yiu's death. *Lok Lok Ê®ÇÊ®Ç (Full name Lee Zhi Lok ÊùéÂ≠êÊ®Ç. Played by Luis Oh) - Talented son of Fuk and Wing Kum. Grandson of Bing and Auntie Shin. He is very enthusiastic towards his education. He knows that his parents work really hard and try to support him in the education field, and hope he gets into a high well known famous school. In the later episodes, he was discovered of having liver problems. *See Kum ÊÄùÁê¥ played by Fiona Yuen - The second wife of Fuk after Wing Kum's death. She is an evil woman who only likes Fuk because of his money. She pretends to be innocent in front of the family until later on when Auntie Shin finds out she was involved in the kidnapping of Lok Lok. Initially only intent on gaining the Lee family's wealth as their daughter-in-law, she eventually falls in love with Ah Fook. When Ah Jing discovers her schemes, and that See Kum and her \\"brother\\" Ah Fatt are really lovers, Ah Fatt hits Ah Jing on her head with a brick, sending her into a coma. Unable to save Ah Jing, See Kum is plagued with guilt until she is exposed in the end. She leaves the family in shame and reappears in the finale as a pregnant wife of a rich Mainland businessman. *Sei Ma Á¥∞Â≠ñ or Ah Yan ÈòøÊ¨£ (literally the little twin, full name Lee Daw Yun ÊùéÂ§öÊ¨£. Played by Florence Kwok) - One of the two twin daughters of Bing and Shin. She holds a high position at a bank, and is married to a wealthy businessman who went broke in the early part of the series. She is also a mother of a young daughter, Puet Puet. She is sometimes a bit demanding, although she is well liked by all the members of the family. (As contrasted with her twin sister, whom Bing dislikes.) She had problems with her \\"Upper-class Mother-in-law\\" and sister- in-law at the beginning of the series, especially when she was on the verge of having a divorce with Ching Wah. *Ching Wah Ê∏ÖËèØ (Played by Law Siu Kwan)- The husband of Sei Ma. He is a philandering wealthy businessman who was victimized by a business partner jealous of his marriage to Sei Ma. He went broke as a result, but managed to salvage his broken marriage with Sei Ma. He set up a business with Hoi after his bankruptcy, and returned to wealth. *Dai Ma (Joyce) Â§ßÂ≠ñ or Ah Foon ÈòøÊ≠° (literally the elder twin, full name Lee Daw Foon ÊùéÂ§öÊ≠°. Played by Kenix Kwok) - The other twin daughter of Bing and Shin whom Sei Ma is intensely jealous of. Outraged by her parents for sending her cousin Lup Sung overseas to study instead of herself when they were young, her fiercely independent nature led her to leave the family years ago to pursue her own studies for seven years in the US. Bing therefore disapproves of her actions. Upon returning to HK, she worked in a fashion company, where she was involved in a secret relationship with her boss (acted by Joe Ma), until it was revealed that her boss was already married. She then moved on to another fashion company where she worked under Helen with her brother On Jai. She left early in the series, after marrying an ex-policeman Ah Bong and migrating to the UK. She is remembered for her stubbornness (some would call it determination). *Bong ÈòøÈÇ¶ (Full name Fung Chun Bong È¶ÆÊåØÈÇ¶. Played by Sunny Chan)- Dai Ma's husband, who is an ex-policeman. He is a helpful man who helps the Lee family many times in his early appearances, whom Dai Ma initially disliked. Later on they fall in love, but he is unable to be with Dai Ma because he of an old life-threatening injury. (Also because he is divorced with a daughter.) After going for a heart operation, he finally marries Dai Ma, and they migrated to the UK. *On Jai ÂÆâ‰ªî (Andy) (Full name Lee Tim On ÊùéÊ∑ªÂÆâ. Played by Hawick Lau)- The youngest son of Bing and Shin, he is a college grad who works in the same company as his sister Dai Ma. His good looks often gets him into a lot of love entanglements. His love affair with Joan, the sister of his boss stretches through the entire series.

(His dad in the show is actually his dad in real life.) *Choi Yiu ÂΩ©Áë§ (Full name Lee Choi Yiu ÊùéÂΩ©Áë§. Played by Angie Cheung) - Bing's younger sister; first wife of Ah Hoi. She has a close and affectionate bond with her niece Dai Ma, who is of a very similar temperament. Initially a wild and irresponsible unmarried mother, she had an ambiguous relationship with Ah Hoi, who had been in love with her since they were young. She left HK in the early part of the series to seek help in curing her Stomach Cancer, without informing the family of her whereabouts. Upon returning, Hoi, thinking Choi Yiu was dead, was in a relationship with Auntie Ho's daughter Seung-Seung. She married Hoi eventually, and changed into a loving and caring wife and mother, but died during a bandit attack in Mainland China. Hoi takes care of Choi Yiu's young daughter Ah Gwan after Choi Yiu's death. She was the first major character to die in the series, and her death was shocking and unexpected, since at that point she had already fully recovered from cancer. *Hoi Êµ∑ or Ah Hoi ÈòøÊµ∑ (Full name Yung Heung Hoi ÂÆπÂêëÊµ∑. Played by Ben Wong)- Adopted son of Auntie Yung. His biological mother, from whom he was separated from during a big fire in the city slum, is the widow of a wealthy Malaysian Chinese tycoon. Hoi works at Sum Dor selling Char Siew since he was young, but eventually forms a construction material company together with Sei Ma's husband Ah Wah, thus becoming a successful businessman. Hoi is the major focus of the series at many different points. His four relationships with Choi Yiu, Seung Seung, Ah Gwai, and Go Nga Man are full of drama and climaxes. *Auntie Yung ÂÆπÂß® (Full name Yung Mu ÂÆπ Â¶π. Played by Tam Sin Hung)- She has served the family, in particular Grandma Ga, for decades. The Lee family treats her as if she is a part of the family. She gets more focus as the series progresses, especially when she finds her two long-lost children, Ah Keng and Ji Ho. *Gwai Ë≤¥ Ah Gwai ÈòøË≤¥ (Full name Ng Fong Gwai Âê≥Ëä≥Ë≤¥. Played by Angie Cheung)- The second wife of Hoi, who looks exactly the same as Choi Yiu (in fact, the two characters were played by the same actress, who needed a break from the show during its production). She became Bing's god- sister, before marrying Hoi. Her questionable (some say downright lacking) ethics have brought her into various disputes throughout the series. She was previously romantically linked with Ah Nam. *Keng ÈòøÁìä (Full name Yu Keng ‰øûÁìä. Played by Kingdom Yuen)- Auntie Yung's long-lost daughter, who eventually married the eldest son of Datuk Gui. Her mental capacity was impaired after a serious illness in her youth, leading her to be called \\"Idiot Keng\\" as a running gag. Keng and Gwai were brought up by the same foster mother. *Vietnamese Ë∂äÂçó (Full name Leung Ga Ming Ê¢ÅÂÆ∂Êòé. Played by Kenny Wong) - Leung Yao's long-lost illegitimate son from Vietnam. Sensible and hardworking, he resembles Auntie Shin in character more than his half brother Yuen Choi and half sister Auntie Ho. He appears at the end of the series to acknowledge Leung Yao as his father, and has a turbulent relationship with an intelligent and pretty doctor, Chiu, who is the elder sister of Joon Joon. Relatives and other membersLau family (upper class in-laws) *The Upper Class In-Law ‰∏äÁ≠âË¶™ÂÆ∂ (Full name Leung Seung Yin Ê¢ÅÂ∞öÁáï. Played by Gung Yu)- Ching Hwa's mother. Although her real name is Leung Seung Yin, she is widely remembered in the series as the upper-class person because of her initial discriminatory view towards less wealthy persons, in addition to commoner cultures and customs that she considered as \\"undesirable\\" for her and her aristocratic cabals. The attitudes, however, somewhat subsided after the family went broke. *Ching Wun ÂäâÊ∏ÖËä∏- Rich, initially snobbish, and highly educated, Ching Wun's love for Dai Sing was strong enough for her to decide to leave her upper-class life behind to marry Dai Sing, who couldn't provide much for her and their two children. She had to work in Sei Ma's bank as a teller eventually to support her own family, after having spent her whole life living off her rich Upper- Class Mother and brother Ching Hwa. Dai Sing and her would provide lots of comic relief sporadically throughout the series. *Dai Sing (Full name Chan Dai Sing Èô≥Â§ßÂãù. Played by Johnny Ngan) - Elder brother of Wing Kum, who did some time in prison for a crime that he wasn't guilty of before he appears on the show. He has since operated a tea stand in the restaurant. He is best remembered for his marriage (And turbulent married life) to Upper-class In- law's highly educated and feisty daughter, Ching Wun. Dai Sing and Ching Wun have a son and a daughter. *Melvin Ê¢ÅÂ∞ö‰∫∫ - The Upper Class In-Law's younger brother would return from Canada a few years after his wife, Becky, runs away with all his money. Melvin is a photographer and later gets a job as a fashion photographer at Helen's clothing company and works with On Jai. At first Melvin and Auntie Ho do not get along, but the two later have a brief romance. Auntie Ho calls Melvin \\"mao see\\". *Sharon Ê¢ÅÂÜ∞Èõ™ (Played by Joyce Tang) - Sharon, who is Melvin's daughter, was blinded during childhood and is able to regain her sight after Auntie Ho's son, Lap Sang, performs eye surgery on Sharon. She therefore falls in love with Lap Sung and marries her, but the marriage was extremely ill-fated and ended up with the death of Rebecca, Sharon's miscarriage and loss of memory, and Lap Sung becoming a cripple. She gets her happy ending eventually though, after regaining her memories, and ends up with a promising young student back in New York (US) named Samson, who is a medical student. =Auntie Ho family= *Auntie Ho Â•ΩÂß®(Full name Leung Yun Ho Ê¢ÅÊΩ§Â•Ω. Played by Nancy Sit)- Leung Yao and Grandma Ga's younger daughter and sister of Auntie Shin and Yuen Choi. She was sold by her parents to an old Mainland Chinese while they were in financial trouble a long time ago. Auntie Ho, therefore, bears a significant grudge against her parents and resent them for neglecting her when she was younger in favour of Shin and Choi (this eventually subsided though). She is quite feisty and works in many different occupations. Her love interests include Melvin, aka \\"mao see\\" (literally cat poop) (Upper Class in law's younger brother), Biu-Lang-Hon (Bing's elder brother), and a doctor, Shan Qing, whose characteristics is not very different from Seymour Skinner on US Cartoon Series The Simpsons. *Lap Sang Á´ãÁîü (Full name Tong Lap Sang ÂîêÁ´ãÁîü. Played by Marco Lo)- The most educated person in the family and is the son of Auntie Ho and her long-lost lover (who is a scammer). This biological father of his tried to expose his true identity as a son born out of wedlock but failed. When Lap Sang returns from medical school in the UK, he is romantically linked to Rebecca (often called \\"Banana\\" by Auntie Ho). Eventually, Lap Sang marries Melvin's daughter, Sharon, after Sharon gets pregnant. Rebecca is twisted and jealous and sets up to ruin Lap Sang and Suet. He is a doctor who eventually was convicted of kidnapping and served time in prison. Since that time, he went through a transformation and rehabilitated his reputation. He is remembered for his romance with a social worker, whose trials and tribulations was portrayed right up to the end of the series. This social worker, Jing, became his second wife. *Ah Jing ÈòøÈùú (Full name Lam Jing Chuen ÊûóÈùúÂ∑ù. Played by Wallis Pang)- A pretty social worker who has a slightly turbulent courtship with Lap Sung. She eventually becomes pregnant with his baby. During her pregnancy, she is beaten into a coma by the lover of Fuk's scheming second wife, who married Fuk only because she was after the family's money. Jing eventually woke up from her coma and became Lap Sung's second wife. (His first wife was Upper-class In-law's niece, Sharon) *Seung Seung ÈõôÈõô (Full name Tong Lai Seung ÂîêÈ∫óÈõô. Played by Candy Law Lum)- Half- sister of Lap Sung. She is the daughter of Auntie Ho and her husband, a rich doctor. Once sold into an arranged marriage by Auntie Ho, Seung Seung's first love was Hoi, even though Hoi had already been courting Choi Yiu for many years while they were growing up in the Lee family. Hoi, however, never took a chance with her, and Seung Seung eventually married Kwok Qiu, an elderly doctor, and left for the US. Seung Seung and Hoi had a baby, whom she cannot bring herself to acknowledge. Hoi and Choi Yiu, and later Gwai after Choi Yiu's death, would take care of this child, treating him like their own. *Principal In-law Ê†°Èï∑Ë¶™ÂÆ∂ The hard-to-get-along, highly principled without being nasty or unreasonable retired principal who eventually became Auntie Ho's mother-in-law. Grandma hates her because of how she refused to allow Auntie Shin to date Principal Gao's son Shan Ching many years ago while they were neighbours. *Shan Ching È´òÂ±±Èùí Auntie Ho's husband. Old and unmarried; very afraid and controlled by his own mother Principal Gao, he eventually falls in love with Auntie Ho after a long period of time where they would tease and squabble with each other. It took a long time for Principal Gao to finally allow him to marry Auntie Ho, and it is ironic because of what happened in the past with Auntie Shin and Grandma. *Ah Mun È´òÈõÖÊñá (Played by Cally KwongÈÑ∫ÁæéÈõ≤) Shan Tseng's stepsister. A very capable businesswoman with business dealings with Hoi and Ching Hwa. She got into a breakdown after finding out that her boyfriend was gay, and that her real mother wasn't Principal Gao, but someone else who died many years ago. She finds solace with Hoi, who was having serious problems with his marriage to Gwai at that time. In the grand tradition of the show, she leaves HK for a better life, thus making an exit from the messy love triangle and the show. =Dai-Bak (Elder Uncle)'s family members= *Biu Lang Han Â§ß‰ºØ (Nickname. Real name Lee Biu Han ÊùéÊ®ôÊº¢. Played by Kenneth Tsang)- Stepbrother of Bing and Choi Yiu. He came to Hong Kong from the Mainland in the middle of the show, and brought along three grown-up children. He had a major misunderstanding with Bing and Choi Yiu years ago when Bing and Choi Yiu's father left them and their mother for Biu Han's mother, but the issue was eventually resolved. Biu Han had a short romance with Auntie Ho, but left HK after he realised that Auntie Ho's true love was not him, but Melvin. *Ji Ho Â≠êÊµ© (Full name Lee Ji Ho ÊùéÂ≠êÊµ©. Played by Chang Tse Sheng)- The most memorable villain of the story. He came to Hong Kong along with Biu Lang Han, but he is the biological son of Auntie Yung. Greed drove him to commit unthinkable deeds including kidnapping and murder, even the destruction of his own family. Ji Ho's death at the hands of the police was one of the most celebrated events in the show's long history, and was well remembered by many people. This character is so successful that the actor who played this character has never played a protagonist in any movies or drama shows ever since Ji Ho's much celebrated death. *Siu Mui Â∞èÊ¢Ö (Full name Lee Siu Mui ÊùéÂ∞èÊ¢Ö. Played by Lam Yi Kei)- The sister of Ji Ho. Siu Mui is somewhat the personification of Mainlander Chinese stereotypes in Hong Kong at the time: old-fashioned, poor fashion tastes, speaks Cantonese with an accent, and lives with a housewife mentality. Aunt Ho helps Siu Mui speak better Cantonese after several other people make fun of Siu Mui's accent. Siu Mui was eventually attached to a chauvinistic Martial Arts mentor Mok Chuen. *Mok Chuen Êú®Â∑ù (Full name Lam Mok Chuen ÊûóÊú®Â∑ù.)- Siu Mui's chauvinistic boyfriend. Ah Jing's estranged elder brother, childhood neighbour of Dai Sing and Wing Kum. *Dai Lik Â§ßÂäõ (Full name Lee Ji Lik ÊùéÂ≠êÂäõ.

He is a rather nerdy character, and had a minor role in the show, besides having a brief ambiguous relationship with Keng while Keng's true love Loi was away. After Ji Ho's death, Ji Lik went to Shanghai to start a business and transformed into a successful and confident businessman.  Datuk Gui Family * Datuk Gui (Played by Chor Yuan Ê•ö Âéü) An elderly authoritarian and nasty figure from a rich Malaysian family, he ends up being very acquainted with the Lee family whom he used to consider low class when his children get romantically involved with the people from the Lee family. He has three wives, the first, Wai Fung, an understanding and supportive woman, mother of Ya Loi, the second the understanding, elegant and compassionate mother of Ya Num, the other, the much younger (sometimes referred to as his mistress), initially wild and flamboyant mother of May May, Sophie. His greatest regrets in live were never forgiving Sophie until the last point and having an affair with another woman while married to his first wife, Wai Fung. He reveals that he would like to be buried in Hong Kong, next to his first wife. His favorite foods are lobster and mango and these would be his offering on his tombstone. *Mrs. Datuk ÊãøÁù£Â§ßÂ§´‰∫∫ (Played by Tsang Yuk-Guen ÊõæÁéâÂ®ü.

She was understanding and dutiful wife When Datuk Gui's family business started to fail, she encouraged him to go out and start a business of his own and that she would take care of the family for him. When he came back, she was pregnant with his son. Datuk Gui had an affair with a dancer. Even though she knew of the affair, she said nothing about it. It was not until the woman came to her that she left Malaysia, still pregnant. She took nothing with her. She went to Hong Kong and it was there that she gave birth to Ya Loi. She died soon after as Datuk Gui found her in the hospital. She never forgave him and her dying wishes was to be buried in Hong Kong rather Malaysia, as a symbol that she never wish to follow him home. Datuk Gui never forgave himself, and it remain his greatest guilt. Datuk Gui's main reason for loving Sophie may have been her resemblance toward Wai Fung, as guessed by May May. She also resembled her daughter-in-law, Keng. His only memorabilia of hers is her photos and a pearl necklace, his first gift to her. Datuk Gui's affair is similar to Ya Loi's affair with Ivy during the early part of his marriage to Keng. Her favorite foods were fresh milk and flaky pastry and these are the offerings on her tombstone. *Mrs. Datuk ÊãøÁù£‰∫åÂ§´‰∫∫ (Played by Leung Biu-Ching Ê¢ÅËëÜË≤û. Full name See To Ju Âè∏ÂæíÁè†) Second wife of Datuk Gui, biological mother of Ya Num and stepmother of Ya Loi.

Her mother named him Gui Dan (similar in sounds to Tortoise Egg or idiot in Cantonese) instead of Lee Dan or Yung Dan, as it would be after his father Ji Ho or his grandmother Auntie Yung. His father shows no affection for him other than the last moments before his death, but even then his feelings were questionable. A fortune teller says that he would grow up to be a responsible child and May May can count on him to raise her in old age. He is heir to 9% of Datuk Gui's fortune. *May May- (Full name Gui Ya May Ê≠∏‰∫ûÁæé. Played by Celine Ma Tai Lo È¶¨ËπÑÈú≤.)

During their first Christmas, she went over to his college dorm and found that he was secretly going out with another girl. Ken had used the $100,000 from the account they shared, and the next day he ran away. She never forgot about him, carried an old Christmas card he had given her and constantly smoke cigarettes (a habit taught by him) when she became unhappy. Ken, who was cousin of Dai Ma's husband Bong, came back to Hong Kong with his pregnant wife Candy. Zhao delivered the son of Candy and Ken.

He was born on the same year, date, hour and hospital as Yah Loi. After he was born Secretary Law carried him and Yah Loi, one on each of his hands. From this point on, he has always believed he was the real son of Datuk Gui. This belief was later disproven. He is the exact mirror image of May May. He believed he is the most handsomest and lucky man in world and that he would one day be rich. He and May May constantly fight, but gets along well with Dan Dan. He originally worked in a very low position at Datuk Gui's company, but after an attempt of sabotage by May May to get him fired, he became May May's personal servant and Dan Dan's babysitter.

When she came to Hong Kong, she was seven months pregnant, and had to be sent to the hospital after being bumped by a dim sum waitress. She gave birth to a baby boy. She was smart enough to know that her husband did not love her or their baby and that he was not true to her. Her main goal in coming back to Hong Kong was to inherit some money from a relative. She unknowingly helped her husband in a plot to steal Zhao's money. When she questioned Ken about his recent activity with Zhao, he told her he was chasing after a $500,000 debt that Zhao had borrow from him. She believed it and went after Zhao, asking her to return the money. Ken told Zhao another lie that Candy had a post-pregnancy mental illness in which she went around saying people owed her money. Feeling sorry for this Zhao lent the money to Ken. She found out about her husband's tricks few days before returning to England and went to ask Zhao what happen between Ken and her. That when she and Zhao found out that they were both being used. She demand divorce before returning to England, saying that this trip to Hong Kong had reveal to her who he really was. Ka Tung remained with her. *Ken or Kenny - (Full name Lam Bo Gin ÊûóÂØ∂Â†Ö. Played by Marco Ngai È≠èÈßøÂÇë.) Former boyfriend of Zhao and cousin of Bong, Dai Ma's husband. He lives in England and rarely goes to Hong Kong. He went to Hong Kong along with his wife, Candy, to gain some inheritance. He is a playboy, who thinks life is all about spend money, playing, gambling, and eating. He blames everybody around him for his actions even his wife. He tried to scheme $500,000 from Zhao by acting like he changed (by giving her flowers, waiting at a restaurant for her, and giving her a check of $10,000 that he had previously taken from her) and tricking his own wife into helping him. Before he left, he stole Auntie Yung's and Grandma Ga's jewelry. He was tricked into riding a taxi where Dai Sing was the driver and beaten by the entire Lee and Law family. It turn out that Zhao had already canceled the check she had given him. *Ka Tung - (Full name Lam Ka Tung ÊûóÂÆ∂Ê£ü. Played by Ê±üÂ∞öÊ°ê.) Candy and Ken's baby son. He was only 7 months old when Doctor Law delivered him. According to Doctor Law he was pretty heavy for being born so early. His name came from a Christmas card to Zhao, a.k.a. Doctor Law, who Ken wrote that they would name their son Lam Ka Tung ÊûóÂÆ∂Ê£ü for. Ken chose out of a plot to swindle Zhao's money, rather than for love toward her. *Helen- Director of a clothing company that Dai Ma and her little brother works in. Her sister, Joan, is entangled in a love affair with Dai Ma's little brother, On Jai. Helen works very hard to build her business and raise Joan. Helen and Keng work together to get money back from a con artist nicknamed Tea Leave Egg or Charles. *Joan- Girlfriend of On Jai. Their on again, off again relationship is very rocky, and Joan did date a wealthy Thai Chinese businessman during the series as they got into frequent contacts due to his business dealings with Helen in Thailand. The businessman eventually fell in love with her elder sister, Helen. That created another set of comical problems towards the end of the series *Guy Kwan ÈõûÂù§ - Owner of the poultry store that supplies the restaurant with chickens. Guy Kwan is a friend of Fuk and Dai Sing and has a crush on Keng. He also has a gambling addiction and often gets in trouble with loan sharks. *Ha Foo Cho, Leung Cha Paw - She is known as the lady that sells Chinese tea. Her store is right across from the roast pork restaurant. She is old and quiet. Sometimes she drops by the roast pork restaurant and buys roast pork. *Lai Gin Long (Played By Felix Lok)- May May's birth father. He is an evil and selfish man who doesn't care about anyone else besides himself, even Sophie and May May is nothing to him. He blackmailed Sohpie that if she didn't give him money, he'll tell Datuk Gui about May May's true paternity. He cheated on his wife, but his wife was, also, cheating on him. He becomes interested in Joan, On Jai's girlfriend, and she, momentarily blinded by greed for money, became attracted to him. It was later explained that she was momentarily blinded by greed for money and that she found a mature man provided a feeling of security to her; thus acted irrationally. After a divorce, he went broke. He tried tricking May May into marrying a rich man, who found pleasure in brutally beating his women.

The result is that these channels open only when the electrochemical gradient is outward, such that their opening will only allow protons to leave cells. Their function thus appears to be acid extrusion from cells. Another important function occurs in phagocytes (e.g. eosinophils, neutrophils, and macrophages) during the respiratory burst. When bacteria or other microbes are engulfed by phagocytes, the enzyme NADPH oxidase assembles in the membrane and begins to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) that help kill bacteria. NADPH oxidase is electrogenic, moving electrons across the membrane, and proton channels open to allow proton flux to balance the electron movement electrically. The functional expression of Hv1 in phagocytes has been well characterized in mammals, and recently in zebrafish, suggesting its important roles in the immune cells of mammals and non-mammalian vertebrates. A group of small molecule inhibitors of the Hv1 channel are shown as chemotherapeutics and anti-inflammatory agents. When activated, the voltage-gated proton channel HV1 can allow up to 100,000 hydrogen ions across the membrane each second. Whereas most voltage-gated ion channels contain a central pore that is surrounding by alpha helices and the voltage-sensing domain (VSD), voltage-gated hydrogen channels contain no central pore, so their voltage-sensing regions (VSD) carry out the job of bringing acidic protons across the membrane. As mentioned, these voltage-gated hydrogen channels only carry outward current, meaning they are used to move acidic protons out of the membrane. As a result, the opening of voltage-gated hydrogen channels usually hyperpolarize the cell membrane, or makes the membrane potential more negative. A recent discovery has shown that the voltage-gated proton channel Hv1 is highly expressed in human breast tumor tissues that are metastatic, but not in non-metastatic breast cancer tissues. Because it has also been found to be highly expressed in other cancer tissues, the study of the voltage-gated proton channel has led many scientists to wonder what its importance is in cancer metastasis. However, much is still being discovered concerning the structure and function of the voltage-gated proton channel.

The madal is used mainly for rhythm-keeping in Nepalese folk music. It is very popular and widely used as hand drum in Nepal. The Madal consists of a cylindrical body with a slight bulge at its center and heads at both ends, one head larger than the other. It is usually played horizontally in a seated position, with both heads played simultaneously. Madal is a national instrument of Nepal. This typical Nepalese percussion instrument is the backbone of most Nepali folk music. The well- known Nepali musician Ranjit Gazmer introduced this instrument to Bollywood music, when he started working under Rahul Dev Burman, and has used it in numerous Bollywood songs such as \\"Hum dono do premi duniya chhod chale\\" and \\"Kanchi re kanchi re\\". There is also a madal drum among certain Adivasi groups. History Madal (Nepali: ‡§Æ‡§æ‡§¶‡§≤) The madal originated in the Magar community of Nepal.  Nomenclature and construction  The ancient name of madal was mardal (‡§Æ‡§∞‡•ç‡§¶‡§≤ in Nepali). Typically, a wooden log is carved so as to form a hollow cavity, called ghar (‡§ò‡§∞). The heads of the drum are made of double-layered goat skins, and a black paste made of flour, iron filings, and egg is burned in to a circular area in the center of each head. This circle adds weight to the head and significantly alters the sound of the drum, giving it a bell-like quality. The heads are fixed to the body of the drum by leather strips running the length of the body, and an additional loose strip of leather which can be looped behind the performer's knees while playing The larger and smaller heads are often referred to as male and female respectively.

Although some taxonomists, including the International Ornithologists' Union, consider it to be a distinct species, other authorities, including the American Ornithological Society, do not consider it separate, and consider it to be a subspecies of the northern pygmy owl. Description It is 15 to 16.5 cm or 17 cm (6 to 7 inches) long and weighs 50 to 65 grams (1.8‚Äì2.3 oz). Its plumage is sandy gray-brown, with females typically more reddish than males. Unlike many related owls, it does not seem to have gray and red morphs. The adult's crown and back have many pale spots, which are biggest on the scapular feathers (where the wings join the back). The tail is long for an owl and is crossed by five or six pale bars. The underparts are off-white with brown streaks. The face shows little contrast except for white \\"false eyebrows\\". Like other pygmy owls (Glaucidium), it has yellow irises and a yellow bill, as well as two white-outlined black triangles on the back on the neck that suggest eyespots. The commonly heard call is distinctly different from that of other pygmy owls in the region: a hoo hoo lasting about two seconds, with five to fifteen seconds between double hoots. This species occasionally begins a bout of hooting with up to five hoots in series. It may also utter \\"a rapid, slightly quavering huhuhu‚Ä¶\\" that may lead to hooting. Range and habitat The cape pygmy owl is endemic to Baja California Sur from the Sierra de la Laguna in the Cape District, where it is fairly common, to the Sierra de la Gigante at least as far north as 26.5¬∞. It inhabits pine and pine-oak woods from 1500 to 2100 meters (5000‚Äì7000 ft.) in altitude. In winter it can descend to 500 meters (1,640 ft.). Classification The American Ornithological Society considers it a subspecies of the northern pygmy owl, Glaucidium gnoma (as it does several other populations). It has also been considered a subspecies of the least pygmy owl. However, it is considered a separate species here following the Handbook of the Birds of the World. According to one authority, DNA evidence suggests that the two species are not closely related. Etymology The epithet hoskinsii commemorates Francis Hoskins, an assistant to Marston Abbott Frazar, an ornithologist who the American businessman George Burritt Sennett paid to collect birds in the 1880s. The first specimen of the cape pygmy owl was collected on one of Frazar's expeditions. ReferencesExternal links * Page with images and sound recording from Owling.com. Accessed Sept. 25, 2007.

Takayuki's sudden betrayal of the Tokugawa forces at the Battle of Toba‚ÄìFushimi was one of the decisive factors which turned the battle in the imperial army's favor. Biography Takayuki was born in 1813 as the son of the previous daimy≈ç of Tsu Domain, T≈çd≈ç Takasawa. His mother was the daughter of the daimy≈ç of Tanakura Domain, Nagai Naonobu. When his father died in December 1824 and he was forced to take up the administration of the domain at the age of 11. In 1842, the Tokugawa shogunate assigned Tsu Domain with the task for fortifying Ise Grand Shrine against incursions of the Black Ships of the European powers by building coastal artillery batteries. Sait≈ç Satsud≈ç, the head of the domain's academy, incorporated rangaku technology to build modern batteries and attempted to modernize the domain‚Äôs military. T≈çd≈ç Takayuki also attempted to introduce other forms of western science, including photography, by sponsoring equipment and a laboratory for Ueno Hikoma at the domain‚Äôs residence in Edo.Himeno, p. 24. During the Tench≈´gumi Incident in 1863, the domain was called upon to send forces to Kyoto to help suppress the pro-sonn≈ç j≈çi rebels. During the Bakumatsu period, the samurai of the domain were divided between factions which supported the Shogunate, and those who supported the concept of K≈çbu gattai, however, sentiment towards to shogunate was only lukewarm. During the Battle of Toba‚ÄìFushimi at the start of the Boshin War, the forces of Tsu Domain initially supported the shogunate; however, when the battle began to turn in the favor of the Satch≈ç Alliance forces, Tsu Domain quickly changed sides, contributing strongly to the defeat of the pro-shogunate forces. Tsu Domain subsequently contributed forces to other battles of the Boshin War, including the Battle of Hakodate on the side of the new Meiji government. On June 28, 1871, Takayuki officially retired, turning over his offices to his eldest son T≈çd≈ç Takakiyo. He died in Tokyo at the age of 83 in 1895. Takayuki is believed by some historians to be the father of the Shinsengumi samurai, T≈çd≈ç Heisuke.

Coaching career= From Leffe to AlbinoLeffe  Leffe and Albinese = Gustinetti started his coaching career in 1988 with Serie D club Leffe, ending the season in third place. He then moved at Promozione club Albinese, leading them to win the league and gaining promotion to Serie D. After a ninth and a tenth place, he left Albinese in 1992 and returned into coaching in 1994, again with Leffe, now in Serie C1. = Lecco = In 1995, he moved to Serie C2's Lecco, where he stayed for two seasons, ended in sixth and second place respectively, and winning promotion to Serie C1 in the latter season. = Lumezzane = In 1997, he signed for Lumezzane, winning a spot in the Serie C1 promotion playoffs but failing to win it. =Reggina, Empoli and Treviso = Since 1998 to 2001 he has coached in Serie B Reggina, Empoli and Treviso, seasons all ended with a dismissal. = AlbinoLeffe = In 2001, he was appointed by Serie C1 minnows AlbinoLeffe, a club founded a few years before following the merger of Leffe and Albinese, both teams previously coached by Gustinetti. In 2003, he led AlbinoLeffe to a surprising and historical promotion to Serie B, after defeating Pisa on playoffs. He served as AlbinoLeffe boss in their two first Serie B campaign, escaping relegation in both cases. = Arezzo and Crotone = He joined newly promoted Serie B club Arezzo in 2005, leading the side to an impressive seventh place; this was followed by an unsuccessful campaign at Crotone, during which he was sacked in the half-season. = The return to AlbinoLeffe = He returned to AlbinoLeffe in 2007, replacing Emiliano Mondonico and starting his experience with an impressive 16 points in the first six league matches. He then managed to lead AlbinoLeffe successfully into the top league position, with strong chances of direct promotion; however, a string of four consecutive home losses, and a troubled relationship with club chairman Gianfranco Andreoletti led the latter to dismiss him on 26 May 2008, after a 0‚Äì4 home loss to Rimini which mathematically excluded AlbinoLeffe from a direct promotion spot, with only one game remaining in the regular season, depriving him of the chance to attend the promotion playoffs. He was replaced by youth team coach and former team player Armando Madonna.  Grosseto  In June 2008 he was announced as new head coach of Serie B team Grosseto for the upcoming 2008‚Äì09 season. After a very impressive start that led the Tuscans in the higher table spots, results declined throughout mid-season, with Gustinetti being dismissed on 15 February 2009. He was replaced by Ezio Rossi; however, on 25 March Gustinetti was recalled at the helm of the biancorossi after Rossi himself was dismissed due to his failure in improving results. In the 2009‚Äì10 he guided Grosseto again into good results, heading his club to the promotion playoff zone once again. However, another small decline in performances, together with a strained relationship with club chairman Piero Camilli, costed him another sacking in March 2010.  Ascoli  On 31 May 2010 it was confirmed he would serve as head coach of Ascoli in the 2010‚Äì11 Serie B season. His stint with the bianconeri club from Marche however lasted a mere few months, as Gustinetti was removed from his head coaching post on the 3rd of November due to poor results, with Ascoli being last-placed in the league.

He was hired only for the Serie B promotion playoffs, in which Lecce challenged and defeated Virtus Entella in a two-legged semifinal to ensure themselves a final against third-placed Carpi.

He was called both a Cydonian and a Sicyonian, probably because he was born at Cydonia and practiced and taught his art in Sicyon. *Aristocles of Sicyon was the grandson of the above, as well as the pupil and son of Cleoetas,Pausanias, v. 24. ¬ß 1 and brother of Canachus. He was not much inferior to his father in reputation. This Aristocles had a pupil, Synno√∂n, who was the father and teacher of Ptolichus of Aegina.Pausanias, vi. 9. ¬ß 1 We are also told, in an epigram by Antipater Sidonius that this Aristocles made one of three statues of the Muses,Greek Anthology, ii. p. 15, no. 35, Jacobs the other two of which were made by Ageladas and Canachus. From these passages we infer that these artists founded a school of sculpture at Sicyon, which secured a hereditary reputation, and of which we have the heads for seven generations, namely, Aristocles the elder, Cleoetas, Aristocles the younger and Canachus, Synno√∂n, Ptolichus, Sostratus, and Pantias. There is some difficulty in determining the age of these artists; but, supposing the date of Canachus to be fixed at about 540‚Äî508 BC, we have the date of his brother, the younger Aristocles, and allowing 30 years to a generation, the elder Aristocles must have lived about 600‚Äî568 BC. Some scholars place him immediately before the period when Zancle was first called Messene,Bockh, Corp. Inscrip. i. p. 39 but there is nothing in the words of Pausanias to require such a restriction. By extending the calculation to the other artists mentioned above, we get the following table of dates: # Aristocles, flourished 600 to 568 BC # Cleoetas, flourished 570‚Äî538 BC # Aristocles & Canachus, flourished 540-508 BC # Synno√∂n, flourished 510‚Äî478 BC # Ptolichus, flourished 480‚Äî448 BC # Sostratus, flourished 450‚Äî418 BC # Pantias, flourished 420‚Äî388 BC These dates are found to agree very well with all that we know of the artists. Karl Julius Sillig gives a table which does not materially differ from the above.Karl Julius Sillig, Catal. Art. s.v. He calculates the dates at 564, 536, 508, 480, 452, 424, and 396 BC respectively. In this computation, it has been assumed that the elder Canachus was the brother of the younger Aristocles, and that Pantias was the seventh in order from the elder Aristocles. Any other supposition would throw the whole matter into confusion. Pausanias mentions, as a work of the elder Aristocles, a group in bronze representing Heracles struggling for a girdle with an Amazon on horseback, which was dedicated at Olympia by Evagoras of Zancle; and, as a work of the younger, a group in bronze of Zeus and Ganymede, dedicated at Olympia by Gnothis, a Thessalian. The Muse by the latter, mentioned above, was in bronze, held a lyre (), and was intended to represent the Muse of the diatonic genus of music.

Chu is currently one of the two women elected to a citywide office out of seven citywide positions. She is also the only Asian-American Assessor elected to serve among the 58 counties in the State of California. Prior to being elected Assessor-Recorder, Chu served as a member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors where she served two terms as the Chair of the Board‚Äôs Budget and Finance Committee, and was a Board Director of the Golden Gate Bridge, Highway and Transportation District. Before joining the Board of Supervisors, Chu served as Deputy Budget Director in the Mayor's office of Public Policy and Finance. Early life Chu is the second of three daughters to Hung Wing and Shuet Ying Chu, who immigrated from Hong Kong in the 1970s with ancestry in Taishan. The Chu family settled into a number of jobs to make ends meet including initially working as a seamstress or as a restaurant worker before starting their own small family restaurant. Chu has stated that growing up in an immigrant family and in a small business household were formative experiences in her life as she never forgot the struggles immigrants and those with limited English face nor the hardships associated with running a small business.Êú±ÂòâÊñáÈõôË¶™ÔºöÂ•≥ÂÖíÂæûÂ∞è Áè≠‰∏äÁ¨¨‰∏ÄÂêç, World Journal (San Francisco), February 28, 2013 Education In 2000, Chu earned a bachelor's degree in public policy from Occidental College where she was a recipient of the James Irvine Foundation Scholarship- a program focused on the development of leaders and educational opportunities for city youth.

Most of the outer barrios of Montevideo are in their biggest part rural areas. In a more general usage of the word barrio, some people refer to the biggest large-scale residential complexes of Montevideo as barrios, although they do not appear as such in official lists.http://www.montevideo.gub.uy/sites/default/files/articulo/Plano_Municipios_soloBarrios_A0.pdf Such are the Parque Posadas in Aires Puros, the Euskal Err√≠a complexes in Malvin Norte and others. Many areas of the city that are now considered barrios had geographically independent populations, that were later absorbed into the growing city. This is the case with Sayago, Pocitos, Carrasco and others. Some barrios grew out of industrial areas, such as Cerro and Nuevo Par√≠s. Other areas that were considered once as barrios have been incorporated in bigger actual ones. Such is the barrio Goes, most of which has been incorporated in Villa Mu√±oz, while smaller parts of it were incorporated in Aguada and La Figurita, the barrio Arroyo Seco which has been incorporated in Bella Vista, the Barrio Borro, Retiro and others. As a consequence, different maps may show differences in the number and the borders of some barrios.

The tomb is now displayed in the museum at Paestum. It is a grave made of five local limestone slabs forming the four lateral walls and the roof, the floor being excavated in the natural bedrock. The five slabs, carefully bonded with plaster, formed a chamber about 215 √ó 100 √ó 80 cm (7.1 √ó 3.3 √ó 2.6 ft) in size. All five slabs forming the monument were painted on the interior sides using a true fresco technique. The paintings on the four walls depict a symposium scene, while the cover slab shows the famous scene that gives the tomb its name: a young man diving into a curling and waving stream of water. Two masters have been distinguished, with the south wall being painted by a less impressive artist than the others.Holloway, p. 373. Unfolded view of the slabs When the tomb was discovered, these surprising frescos revealed its importance, as they appear to be the \\"only example of Greek painting with figured scenes dating from the Orientalizing, Archaic, or Classical periods to survive in its entirety. Among the thousands of Greek tombs known from this time (roughly 700‚Äì400 BC), this is the only one to have been decorated with frescoes of human subjects.\\"Holloway, p. 365. This was presumably inspired by the many Etruscan painted tombs; Paestum was at the time a few miles from the border of the Greek and Etruscan zones of influence at the River Sele. Wall-paintings in other types of building were common in the Greek world, but survivals are extremely rare. The local Campanians, who had taken control of Paestum by about 400 BC, left many painted tombs, mostly showing an obsession with horses and equine sport. Several of these are also in the museum in Paestum. In the interior of the tomb, only a few objects were found: near the corpse (widely supposed to be a young man, despite the heavily deteriorated state of the skeleton) were a turtle shell,Probably part of a lyre whose wooden frame had rotted away. two ar√Ωballoi and an Attic lekythos. This last object, in black- figure technique from about 480 BC, helped the discoverer and other scholars to date the tomb to about 470 BC. NotesReferences * R. Ross Holloway.

It is located in the Chiltern Hills, 1.7m south of the town of Tring in the county of Hertfordshire and on the county boundary with Buckinghamshire. The highest point in Hertfordshire is 803 feet (245 m) above sea level, this is a quarter mile (400 m) from Hastoe within Pavis Wood. Running close to Hastoe is Grim's Ditch an Iron Age structure built around 300BC. The section in the Chilterns runs from Bradenham to Pitstone. In the 13th century the manor of Hastoe was conveyed to Ralph le Clerk of Tring by Thomas de Northwode. During the 14th century the lands came into the possession of the Verney family. This resulted in the manor being annexed to the manor of Bunstreux and Richardyns.A History of the County of Hertford: volume 2 British History Online, Accessed 12 Sept 2010 Hastoe has been closely associated with Tring with parts of Hastoe being incorporated into the Manor of Great Tring in the 17th century. During the 19th century Hastoe became closely associated with the Rothschild family. Nathan Rothschild had begun to rent land and properties in the area as early as 1833, including Hastoe House, a large property in the centre of the hamlet. Nathan's son, Lionel de Rothschild like most of the family was said to be obsessed with hunting and set up his own kennels at Hastoe in 1838. Subsequently, Hastoe being as part of the Tring estate, came into the hands of Lionel de Rothschild acquiring it at auction in 1872. Many of the building of Hastoe were built by the Rothschilds, some following the demolition of earlier properties such as the Hastoe Brewery in 1882. Farm buildings were added to Hastoe, Oakengrove and Longcroft Farms and cottages erected for farm workers. Also built by the family were a chapel, which continued to serve a congregation until 1962, a corn mill, which burned down in 1964, and a distinctive Village Hall known as the Hastoe Room frequented by the Working Man's Club. The Rothschild's estate was sold at auction in October 1938.Matters Village Website, Accessed 12 September 2010 Richard Llewellyn-Davies (1912‚Äì1981) was created Baron Llewelyn-Davies, of Hastoe on 16 January 1964.

He released five critically acclaimed albums before his career was cut short by his sudden death at the age of 28. Tinsley Ellis called him ‚Äòthe most gifted young blues guitarist on the scene... he was a triple threat on guitar, vocals and as a songwriter‚Äô. Career Costello mastered traditional blues guitar at an early age and began his career while still in high school. His records became increasingly eclectic as his career progressed. Early years Born in Philadelphia, Costello moved to Atlanta at the age of nine. Obsessive about the guitar from a young age, he got hooked on the blues after buying Howlin‚Äô Wolf's 'Rockin' Chair Album'. At 14 the young prodigy created a stir in a Memphis guitar shop, where an employee tipped his father off about a talent contest sponsored by the Beale Street Blues Society, which Costello duly entered and won. He formed his first band shortly after. At sixteen, Costello recorded his first album, Call The Cops (1996), already ‚Äòdisplaying a flawless command of 1950s blues guitar‚Äô, in the words of music historian Tony Russell. His lead guitar work on Susan Tedeschi's gold-selling album, Just Won't Burn, (1998), subsequently brought him national exposure. Costello's band later toured as Tedeschi's backing group. \\"His playing is shockingly deep for a 20-year old\\", wrote the Allmusic guide of Costello's second album, Cuttin‚Äô In (2000),[ Allmusic review of Cuttin' In] which was nominated for a W. C. Handy Award for Best New Artist Debut.[ Allmusic biography] The follow-up, Moanin‚Äô For Molasses, was equally well received; the Allmusic guide drew attention to Costello's \\"soulful voice\\" and his \\"ability to mesh blues, R&B; and soul\\".[ Allmusic review of Moanin' For Molasses] \\"Passionate... distinctive and often compelling... Costello's vocals are most astonishing,\\" reported Blues Revue Magazine.Blues Revue Magazine's review of Moanin' For Molasses In concert Costello honed his skills through almost constant performing, playing over 300 gigs a year and touring widely in the United States and Europe. His reputation as a brilliant live performer enabled him to play alongside blues luminaries such as B. B. King and Buddy Guy (Ma Rainey House benefit concert, Columbus, Georgia, June 1997), James Cotton (Cotton's 64th birthday concert in Memphis) and Hubert Sumlin (South by Southwest, Austin, Texas, March 2005). When not touring, Costello made a living playing small venues in his home town of Atlanta, Georgia, such as the Northside Tavern. Richard Rosenblatt, former President of Tone-Cool Records, recalls Costello's performances: > As a guitarist he was astounding, but for Sean it was never about showing > off monstrous chops or stroking his own ego. His playing always fit the > song; he would work the tone and phrasing, sometimes with an economy of > notes that let the empty spaces hang achingly for what seemed like hours. > When he did take off on the occasional blazing run, he was the ultimate > tightrope walker, flirting fearlessly with danger before bringing it all > back home with the unlikeliest of phrases that was still, somehow, perfect. Later career Through Amy Helm of Ollabelle, Costello met her father, Americana musician Levon Helm, formerly of The Band, whose eclecticism encouraged Costello to further develop his interests outside the blues: \\"he really blew it wide open for me. He‚Äôd play a Chuck Berry tune, then a blues, then a country tune or a rock number or whatever, and he didn‚Äôt even think twice about it.\\" Levon Helm and the members of Ollabelle were among the contributors to Costello‚Äôs fourth, self-titled album, recorded in New York City with input from local musicians. With an eclectic set list, and arrangements reminiscent more of Memphis soul than Chicago blues, Sean Costello (2005) marked a departure from his earlier work. Costello‚Äôs guitar took a backseat to his voice, which by now \\"had acquired a ragged edge of considerable power\\" (Tony Russell). In 2007 Costello's playing on Nappy Brown's comeback album, Long Time Coming, was singled out for praise by the critics.[ Allmusic review of Long Time Coming] The following year Costello released what was to be his last album, We Can Get Together, acclaimed by many as his best work.[ Allmusic review of We Can Get Together] His guitar playing on this record was described variously as \\"incendiary\\", \\"searing\\", and \\"blistering red hot\\". It earned Costello two Blues Music Award nominations for Best Contemporary Album and Best Contemporary Male Artist. Hal Horowitz of the Allmusic guide summed up We Can Get Together with the following: > The material is so strong and the ensemble playing of his band so effortless > that he doesn't need to distract attention from the songs with the extended > soloing he is capable of. Most importantly, he establishes a greasy groove > that weaves through each cut, connecting them even when the styles differ. > While Costello is clearly inspired by the blues greats, many of whom he has > covered on previous collections, he slants more to '70s Southern soul, rock, > and R&B; here, dousing these genres with a bucket load of swamp water and > spearheaded by his whiskey-laced vocals. There's a thick, gooey atmospheric > vibe that hangs over the album, gels its contents, and shows Costello to be > a terrific singer and songwriter and guitar talent just hitting his peak. On October 11, 2014, Sean was inducted into the Georgia Music Hall of Fame. Death Sean Costello was found dead in his Atlanta hotel room on April 15, 2008, one day before his 29th birthday. He was in treatment for dual diagnosis at the time of his death, and a lawsuit was filed with the facility. He had not slept in three days, having been discharged in a manic episode. The day he died, he told friends he wasn't feeling well and couldn't sleep. That night, he died of an overdose. Costello's family revealed he suffered from bipolar disorder and set up the Sean Costello Memorial Fund for Bipolar Research in his honor.
