It was founded in 1948 by Salum Abdullah, who had previously formed the Morogoro Jazz Band. For about twenty years, Cuban Marimba was one of the most popular muziki wa dansi (dance music) bands in Tanzania.  History  Salum Abdallah was a prolific songwriter and musician who played guitar and mandolin. He was a \\"chotara,\\" a person of mixed races. The main themes of Abdallah's music were love, life wisdom, the good and evil of mankind, and even politics. One of his popular songs was \\"Mkono wa Idd\\", which is usually played on the radio during Idd festivities. Preceding Abdallah's death, the group released a twist tune, a departure from his suave rumba style, called \\"Hapo zamani sana\\" about the horrible colonial days in South Africa, and \\"Wanawake wa Tanzania wazuri sana,\\" a tribute to Tanzanian women. In 1965, Abdullah died in a car accident. While he was replaced by Juma Kilaza, but the band declined in popularity over the following years.

Biography  \\"Tormented Giant\\" by Geoff Hunt, showing the style of nautical art of this artist Geoff Hunt is a leading figure in marine art. According to Artist Partners Ltd he is ‚Äòone of the world‚Äôs finest painters of 18th and 19th century ships.‚ÄôArtist Partners Ltd, http://www.artistpartners.com/spotlight/geoff_hunt.html Hunt is perhaps best known in popular perception for his depictions of naval scenes adorning the covers of Patrick O‚ÄôBrian‚Äôs bestselling ‚ÄòAubrey-Maturin‚Äô novels, a connection he began in 1988. He also has painted scenes from C.S. Forester's Horatio Hornblower series and Julian Stockwin's Thomas Kydd series. As William Delmont notes, ‚ÄòThough he was a renowned book cover artist before his partnership with O‚ÄôBrian, Hunt‚Äôs work gained more widespread commercial success through the novels.‚Äô In a 2008 interview with Artist & Illustrators magazine, Hunt asserted ‚ÄòI find ships awesome, fascinating, and slightly frightening.‚Äô Hunt attended Kingston and Epsom Schools of Art, 1966‚Äì70, where he studied graphic design. Upon graduation, following a couple of years in advertising, Hunt established himself as a freelance artist and designer. Hunt was Art Editor for the popular Warship quarterly journal, from its inception in 1977 until 1979. In addition to his illustrative work, Hunt has forged a successful career exhibiting across the globe. He is a Past-President of the Royal Society of Marine Artists. Whilst he continues to paint historic scenes, Hunt also depicts contemporary pleasure yachts, warships and other vessels. A wide selection of his work can be found in The Marine Art of Geoff Hunt (2004), published by Conway Publishing. Warships International Fleet Review found it ‚ÄòSpectacular and highly recommended.‚ÄôDennis Andrews, ‚ÄòBook Reviews‚Äô, Warships International Fleet Review (August 2009) Famed for his attention to minute detail, Hunt once contacted ‚Äòthe Royal Observatory for the altitude and azimuth of the sun at a certain latitude and longitude at an exact moment in history‚Äô to maintain the historical accuracy of one of his pieces.Julian Stockwin, in Geoff Hunt, The Marine Art of Geoff Hunt: Master Painter of the Naval World of Nelson and Patrick O‚ÄôBrian In February 2007, Hunt was asked by Rear-Admiral John Lippiett, Chief Executive of the Mary Rose Trust to paint an artist‚Äôs reconstruction of Henry VIII‚Äôs infamous flagship. Hunt accepted the commission, finally completing the painting in January 2009 after hours of extensive and meticulous research. An article by Hunt recounting the experience can be found in the Shipwright 2010 annual. Hunt‚Äôs illustrations adorn The Frigate Surprise: The Design, Construction and Careers of Jack Aubrey‚Äôs Favourite Command (2008), which he co-authored with respected maritime historian, Brian Lavery. Aubrey‚Äôs creator Patrick O‚ÄôBrian has proclaimed that ‚ÄòGeoff Hunt‚Äôs pictures, perfectly accurate in period and detail, but very far from merely representational, are often suffused with a light reminiscent of Canaletto.‚Äô Hunt lives in Wimbledon with his wife and two children.

The battalion was part of the Army Group Centre that operated in Belarus.Kentiy, A. Roman Shukhevych. Encyclopedia of History of Ukraine. 2013 Nachtigall was an intelligence and diversion group of Abwehr, but according to other historians a Security Police unit, composed almost exclusively from members of the OUN(b), who were transported from Vinnytsia to Neuhammer on 13 August 1941 and disarmed at gunpoint due to political disagreement with the German leadership. Historian Frank Golczewski says the Battalion fought against partisans and participated in the Jewish genocide in Belarus. According to historian John- Paul Himka no one has specifically studied the activities of Schuma 201 in relation to the destruction of the Jewish population. But we do know ‚Äì wrote Himka ‚Äì that the Germans routinely used the Schuma battalions in Belarus both to fight partisans and to murder Jews. Battalion 201 numbered 650 persons, most of whom belonged to Stepan Bandera‚Äôs wing of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists.

Many of its members, especially the commanding officers, would later be recruited into the Ukrainian Insurgent Army. Formation and training This formation was formed on 21 October 1941 with 4 companies. Their commanders were: * 1st - Roman Shukevych (and deputy commander of the battalion), * 2nd - M. Brigider, * 3rd - Vasyl Sidor, * 4th - Pavlyk. The formal commander of the Battalion became former Polish Army Major Evhen Pobyhushchy, however, the SD liaisons officer Wilhelm Mocha became the actual Commander of the Battalion. According to the writings of Major Evhen Pobyhushschiy, by the time of the battalion's formation most of the Ukrainian soldiers considered both Germany and the Soviet Union to be enemies of Ukraine, but considered the Soviets to be the greater enemies to be fought first. During the training period there were tensions between the German command and the Ukrainians. They departed for Belarus on March 19 and 22, 1942..–ö. –ü–∞—Ç—Ä–∏–ª—è–∫. –í—ñ–π—Å—å–∫–æ–≤–∞ –¥—ñ—è–ª—å–Ω—ñ—Å—Ç—å –û–£–ù(–ë) —É 1940‚Äî1942 —Ä–æ–∫–∞—Ö. ‚Äî –£–Ω—ñ–≤–µ—Ä—Å–∏—Ç–µ—Ç —ñ–º–µ–Ω—ñ –®–µ–≤—á–µ–Ω–∫–æ \\\\–Ü–Ω-—Ç —ñ—Å—Ç–æ—Ä—ñ—ó –£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω–∏ –ù–ê–ù –£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω–∏ –ö–∏—ó–≤, 2004 pp. 373-375 The Battalion were given German Police Uniforms.

The battalion wasn't concentrated in one place, but was spread out in order to guard various strategic areas. For example, one group guarded large ammunition and weapon warehouses while other groups were stationed in various Belarusian villages. They guarded bridges, protected the German administration, and hunted in the woods for Soviet partisan bases. The conflicts between Germans and Ukrainians, evident during the training, continued during these operations; relations between the German and Ukrainian officers were poor..–ö. –ü–∞—Ç—Ä–∏–ª—è–∫. –í—ñ–π—Å—å–∫–æ–≤–∞ –¥—ñ—è–ª—å–Ω—ñ—Å—Ç—å –û–£–ù(–ë) —É 1940‚Äî1942 —Ä–æ–∫–∞—Ö. ‚Äî –£–Ω—ñ–≤–µ—Ä—Å–∏—Ç–µ—Ç —ñ–º–µ–Ω—ñ –®–µ–≤—á–µ–Ω–∫–æ \\\\–Ü–Ω-—Ç —ñ—Å—Ç–æ—Ä—ñ—ó –£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω–∏ –ù–ê–ù –£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω–∏ –ö–∏—ó–≤, 2004 pp. 378-386 The stay in Belarus provided the Ukrainian soldiers not only with to opportunity to gain experience in partisan warfare but also provided insight into the German tactics of fighting against partisans.

Disbanding On 1 December 1942 after the expiration of their contracts, the members of the Legion refused to promulgate it. As the result, the 201st Battalion personnel was taken into detention and relocated to Lviv.

Some were arrested and placed in the jail on Lonsky street, Roman Shukhevych escaped, and went into hiding.

Additionally, Ja'far al-Sadiq replied in response to a question: \\"'Would almsgiving (equal to the price of aqeeqah) be sufficient instead of aqeeqah?'\\" with the answer that: 'No, it wouldn't be sufficient; Allah likes giving food and submission to his will.'\\"The rulings (Ahkams) of Aqeeqah eporsesh.com Retrieved 26 June 2018Is aqeeqah obligatory to Mustahab (recommended)? yjc.ir Retrieved 26 June 2018 Benefits Aqiqah is a type of sadaqah and it is also sunnah.Sunan al-Tirmidhi, hadith #1522‚Äì1524 According to another hadith from Ja'far al-Sadiq, every born is in pawn of aqeeqah; namely it would be exposed to death/kinds of calamities if they don't do aqeeqah for the child.Aghighah and its rulings islamquest.net Retrieved 26 June 2018 It is Sunnah for the parents to eat from the meat of aqiqah. Islamic historical usage Abu Talib ibn Abd al-Muttalib performed aqiqah for Muhammad on the seventh day of his birth and invited members of his family for the occasion, who asked \\"what is this?\\" to which he replied \\"Aqiqah for Ahmad\\". He claimed to have named him Ahmad \\"because of the praises of the inhabitants of the skies and the Earth for him\\". Muhammad is said to have performed aqiqah for both Hasan ibn Ali and Husayn ibn Ali, his grandsons, on the seventh day of their births respectively by sacrificing one sheep each; the leg of which was given to the nurse that helped with the delivery. Anointing the baby with the blood of the sacrificed animal for aqiqah was a common practice among Arab pagans and was therefore prohibited in Islam. An aqiqah performed by Ghazi Burhanuddin caused disparity in the Gour Kingdom, eventually triggering the Conquest of Sylhet in 1303 - an event instrumental to the flourishing spread of Islam in eastern Bengal.

Biography S≈Çonimski was born in Warsaw in 1922 and he finished \\"underground\\" studies of medicine during World War II in occupied Poland. He was a member of the Polish resistance movement and the Armia Krajowa, and he fought during the Warsaw Uprising. According to his own account, he became interested with genetics when he discovered, among ruins of a German police station and while performing an act of sabotage, a German book on the experiments of George Wells Beadle and Boris Ephrussi. Antoni S≈Çonimski and Piotr S≈Çonimski After the war, he finished medical studies at the Jagiellonian University in Krak√≥w. In 1947, S≈Çonimski emigrated and settled in France, as members of Armia Krajowa were prosecuted by the newly established communist government in Poland. Once in Paris, he joined the group of Boris Ephrussi and started working in the field of genetics. In 1952 he obtained his Ph.D. Between 1971 and 1991, S≈Çonimski was the director of Centre de G√©n√©tique Mol√©culaire of the French CNRS in Gif-sur-Yvette. S≈Çonimski never broke the contacts with his home country, Poland. Since 1980, he was heading the Solidarit√© France-Pologne, organizing aid for Poland. He frequently hosted Polish intelectualists and dissidents, such as Adam Michnik, Tadeusz Mazowiecki, Maria and Leszek Ko≈Çakowski. When martial law was introduced in Poland in 1981, he organized financial support for scientists repressed by the government. The money was smuggled and distributed in Poland by two Polish couriers: Wac≈Çaw Gajewski, a professor of genetics, and W≈Çadys≈Çaw Kunicki- Goldfinger, a professor of microbiology. S≈Çonimski gave them the code names \\"Eukaryote\\" and \\"Prokaryote\\", as Gajewski was working on fungi, and Kunicki- Goldfinger was a microbiologist. Scientific achievements Piotr S≈Çonimski did pioneering work on yeast mitochondrial genetics. He was one of the first to show that genetic information is passed outside of the nucleus in mitochondria, and his subsequent, much cited work led to establishment of the field of mitochondrial genomics. In 1980, he discovered that some parts of the introns in yeast mitochondria encode an enzyme‚Äîwhich he called a maturase‚Äîthat aids the splicing and the maturation of mRNA.

The bikes could have defective handle bar stems which would not tighten sufficiently to lock onto the bicycles. This can cause the front wheel not to turn properly, resulting in serious injuries to the rider from falls. Dynacraft stated that is not aware of any injuries or incidents involving these bicycles. The bikes have a model number on the left side of the seat post. The girls' bikes have model number 8504-50 and are purple. The boys' bikes have model number 8504-51 and are blue. The women's bikes have model number 8547-84 and also are purple. The men's bikes have model number 8547-85 and are black. The words \\"Great Divide\\" are located on the cross-tubes of these bicycles and the word \\"KALLOY\\" is located on the handlebar stems.

In the last thirty years he has written various poems, three novels and also lyrics for 525 songs (registered with AEPI) in the contemporary Greek rebetika, la√Øka (pop music) and elafra (light music) genres. He has collaborated with various music composers, and has occasionally worked as a record producer. Among those, he has often worked with Christos Nikolopoulos with whom he has had a number of popular records (including ŒúŒØŒ± ŒµŒØŒΩŒ±Œπ Œ∑ ŒøœÖœÉŒØŒ± - One matter counts, and ŒöŒ¨œÄŒøŒπŒ±, Œ∫Œ¨œÄŒøœÖ, Œ∫Œ¨œÄŒøœÑŒµ - Some woman, somewhere, sometime). Together they also created and produced a CD with 12 songs (December 1986), for which they were able to assemble together 11 popular Greek performers, including Giorgos Dalaras, Haris Alexiou, mygreek.fm Stratos Dionysiou, Giannis Parios, and Manolis Mitsias. Nikolopoulos performed one of the songs in the CD as well, his first public singing performance ever. The CD was launched as \\"Œ§œÅŒ±Œ≥ŒøœçŒ¥ŒπŒ± Œ≥ŒπŒ± œÑŒøœÖœÇ œÜŒØŒªŒøœÖœÇ ŒºŒøœÖ\\" - Songs for my friends. Other quite well known performersBook Review by Elliniko-Fenomeno.gr of Hapsiadis pop songs were Stelios Kazantzidis, GlykeriaTa Nea tou Didimoteixou and Manolis Aggelopoulos. Life Lefteris Hapsiadis was born in October 1953 in Feres, and lived during his early life in Koila,ŒòœÅŒ±Œ∫ŒπŒ∫ŒÆ ŒìŒÆ both agglomerations located in the Greek Prefecture (ŒùŒøŒºœåœÇ) of Evros. This is the most north-eastern region of Greece, bordering with Turkey in the east, and with Bulgaria in the north. Hapsiadis refers to Koila as his \\"Paradise on Earth\\",second chapter pp25 of his second novel \\"A vagabond angel\\" and nowadays he spends a major part of his life there. His family origin is from Pontos; this is the area in the north of present-day Turkey, along its Black Sea coast. To this day Hapsiadis has been loyal to his Pontos origins and he has often collaborated in various artistic initiatives to preserve the cultural heritage of the land of his ancestors. An example includes the production of three CD records in the Pontos dialect, performed by Kazantzidis and Xrysanthos (an authentic Pontos singer), in the late eighties, early nineties . Hapsiadis is fairly knowledgeable of the Pontos Greek dialect that he learned from his parents and grandmother in Koila. He attended high school in Alexandroupolis, Thrakinea June 3rd, 2009 the administrative capital of Evros. For this purpose his entire family moved to town from Koila. During that period his father owned a kiosk, typical of Greek city landscapes, selling printed press items, like newspapers, magazines, pocket books, postcards, etc. Working at the kiosk as well gave him the opportunity to read a lot and grow his appetite for the Greek lyrics of rebetika, a.k.a. the songs of manges, members of a sort of inner city and urban slums gangs in the early 20th century. When most of his age peers enjoyed pop and rock, Hapsiadis was discovering little known events and details surrounding rebetika songs, their performers and lyrics. He developed a habit of collecting rebetika lyrics and writing them down in a notebook as his favorite pastime. That helped him a lot in being accepted in the circles of key rebetika industry players, in later years. For six months he attended college classes in Patras, in the department of Biology Œ£œÑŒ∑ŒΩ œÄŒªŒ±œÑŒµŒØŒ± œÑŒøœÖ ŒòœÅœÖŒªŒøœÅŒØŒøœÖ - New Free Day before he dropped out and got entirely absorbed inside the professional world of rebetika in the Greek capital, Athens. He met Giorgos Dalaras, and through him he later came close to quite a few key actors in the Greek pop music industry. Names include Lefteris Papadopoulos, a widely known Greek lyrics writer, the composer Christos Nikolopoulos, and various popular Greek pop singers Stelios Kazantzidis, Stratos Dyonisiou and Manolis Aggelopoulos. He also became close friends with Vassilis Vassilikos, a prominent novels writer. Vassilikos became internationally known by his \\"Z\\" novel, a story about the assassination of Grigoris Lambrakis, a left-wing political activist in the mid-1960s. That novel was later made into a movie as part of a trilogy by Greek Director Costa Gavras, with Yves Montand in the leading role. In his first novel, Hapsiadis devoted a chapter to a dramatic period of Vassilikos' life, right after the loss of his spouse Mimi, in Rome, Italy.  Songs  Per the generally accepted public opinion his most popular song lyrics were Mia einai i ousia (ŒúŒπŒ± ŒµŒπŒΩŒ±Œπ Œ∑ ŒøœÖœÉŒØŒ±, \\"One matter counts\\") that he wrote upon a NikolopoulosŒüŒëŒ£ŒôŒ£ music score during the mid-80s. The song was originally performed by Haris Alexiou and later, following accrued popularity, by quite a few other performers, including Giorgos Dalaras. The lyrics playfully deal with immortality, whereby the author admits that nothing is \\"immortal\\" and begs Almighty God to eliminate Death for good, after the former had a few drinks first. The lyrics are used in a passage in his second book, when the author dies and struggles to get into Paradise, but comes across a rather annoyed St-Peter, who didn't seem to have liked his \\"Mia einai i Ousia\\" song at all. Another popular song of his, performed by Giorgos Dalaras, was Kappoia, kapou, kapote (ŒöŒ¨œÄŒøŒπŒ±, Œ∫Œ¨œÄŒøœÖ, Œ∫Œ¨œÄŒøœÑŒµ). Among his songs there are two referring to the Prefecture of Evros, the towns of Alexandroupolis and Orestiada, in the far north. It is generally known in Greece that the border regions of the country, especially Greece's eastern border with Turkey, are the least desirable areas for young Greeks to serve their country during their military service. In addition, until recent years, Greek conscripts were treated as second rank citizens in the towns and villages of Evros, as many among them would admit to this day. Unless they enjoyed a military rank of some sort, conscripts wouldn't be typically admitted inside many public venues, and many local businessmen would prefer to live without them entering their businesses. Hapsiadis was inspired by this to write two emotional songs, Alexandroupoli meria,song lyrics originally performed by Dimitris Mitropanos, and Oresteiada,song lyrics performed by Stelios Dionysiou and Ploutarchos.

He only lately decided to focus on writing novels and had his first three written after 2005, more than twenty years after he started writing lyrics. All of them are largely autobiographic with many details about events that actually took place and form part of the history of modern rebetika. His first two novels were \\"Œó Œ∂œâŒ∑ ŒºŒøœÖ œÑœÅŒ±Œ≥ŒøœçŒ¥Œπ œÑŒø œÑœÅŒ±Œ≥ŒøœçŒ¥Œπ Œ∂œâŒ∑\\" (My life (is) a song, the song (is) life)Œó Œ∂œâŒ∑ ŒºŒøœÖ œÑœÅŒ±Œ≥ŒøœçŒ¥Œπ œÑŒø œÑœÅŒ±Œ≥ŒøœçŒ¥Œπ Œ∂œâŒ∑ and \\"Œü Œ±ŒªŒÆœÑŒ∑œÇ Œ¨Œ≥Œ≥ŒµŒªŒøœÇ\\" (An angel vagabond).Œü Œ±ŒªŒÆœÑŒ∑œÇ Œ¨Œ≥Œ≥ŒµŒªŒøœÇ Book Review by Elliniko-Fenomeno.gr In his second novel, although most of his writing describes real life events, locations and names of real persons, the author presents them as the building blocks of a \\"fiction\\" storyline.

As a self-taught author, Hapsiadis creates unusual plots wherein key Greek music industry players participate as personages. In all his novels to-date his heroes maintain their real life names; however, in his second novel, Hapsiadis uses the name LelosŒïŒªŒµœçŒ∏ŒµœÅŒø ŒíŒÆŒºŒ± instead of his own given Christian name of Lefteris to represent himself as the leading actor. All three novels are written in simple everyday spoken Greek. He usually places verses inside the text, often for reasons of historic significance to the context he describes.VJK Diaries All his novels expose events with actual historic data. He often offers his own insights in the evolution of rebetika from the times of Markos Vamvakaris and Vassilis Tsitsanis (pre- and post- World War II) to the present day. The events he addresses, many of which he himself witnessed as participant, are presented in quite a bit of detail. With a few scarce exceptions, Hapsiadis avoids criticism of his book personages, however, on occasions, he is being quite critical of himself and his own weaknesses. Honors During his 25-year-long career as a lyrics writer, Hapsiadis achieved a number of Golden and Platinum record awards and occasionally he has been publicly recognizedŒó Œ†ŒëŒ§Œ°ŒôŒîŒë for his contribution to the Greek Popular Music by the Prefecture of EvrosŒùŒøŒºŒ±œÅœáŒØŒ± ŒïŒ≤œÅŒøœÖ ŒòœÅŒ¨Œ∫Œ∑ŒùŒïŒ§ and Municipalities of Alexandroupolis and Feres with organized concerts dedicated to his song-lyrics successes.

Early life Moir was born in Rutherglen, Scotland, to parents John and Elizabeth Moir. His father was a carpenter by trade, and Moir also had two siblings. In 1923, their family immigrated to the United States and chose to live in Niagara Falls, New York. As a freshman at Niagara Falls High School, Moir stood only tall. When he graduated from NFHS he enrolled at Trott Vocational School, at which point he had finished growing to and 184 lbs. It was at Trott where Moir first played basketball. When he finished his vocational education, Moir got a job at American Sales Book Company as their bookkeeper. He played on the company's industrial league basketball team, but it was actually his job performance that afforded him the opportunity to attend college. College Moir decided to enroll at the University of Notre Dame in South Bend, Indiana. Back then, NCAA rules prohibited freshmen from playing varsity sports, so it was not until Moir's sophomore year of 1935‚Äì36 that he was able to play basketball for coach George Keogan. Despite having not played basketball until the interim period between high school graduation and college, Moir led the Fighting Irish to a 22‚Äì2‚Äì1 record and the Helms Athletic Foundation NCAA National Championship in his first season of eligibility. He played the forward position and led the team in scoring at 11.3 points per game (ppg). Moir was also named the Helms Foundation College Basketball Player of the Year. Over the next two seasons, he led the team in scoring at 13.2 and 10.5 ppg, respectively, while also being named a consensus All-America selection in each of his three years playing for Notre Dame. Moir had broken every single school scoring record that Edward \\"Moose\\" Krause had set during his three-time All-American career earlier that decade. Professional After graduating from Notre Dame, Moir played professionally in the National Basketball League. In his first two seasons in the league, he won two NBL championships as a member of the Akron Firestone Non-Skids in 1938‚Äì39 and 1939‚Äì40. Over the course of those two championship seasons Moir averaged 7 ppg, and in the 1940 playoffs he led all players with an 11 ppg average. He spent one more season playing for Akron before joining the Rochester Seagrams in 1942. However, World War II suspended Rochester's ability to play. When Moir resumed play in 1945‚Äì46, he joined the Cleveland Allmen Transfers for whom he played his final season. When his NBL career ended, he had played for four years, won two league championships and scored 562 points in 89 total games. Later life In his post-basketball life, Moir lived in Carlisle, Pennsylvania and worked for the Carlisle Tire and Rubber Company. He and his wife Marjorie raised two daughters and one son.

The museum covers American law enforcement through interactive exhibits, historical and contemporary artifact collections, with a dedicated space for research and educational programming. It officially opened on October 13, 2018. History In 2000, the United States Congress authorized the establishment of the National Law Enforcement Museum, to tell the story of law enforcement in the United States. Stories of the fallen will be featured in the Museum's \\"Hall of Remembrance.\\" The bill, signed into law by President Bill Clinton on November 9, 2000, authorized the planning for the museum. The public review process to authorize construction at the site took five years. On October 14, 2010, Attorney General Eric Holder, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano and others broke ground on the construction of the museum. As of October 2012, over $58 million in private donations have been raised. On February 28, 2014, Rep. Steny Hoyer introduced the bill To amend the National Law Enforcement Museum Act to extend the termination date (H.R. 4120; 113th Congress) into the United States House of Representatives. The bill would extend until November 9, 2016, the authority of the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, a nonprofit organization, to construct a museum on federal lands within the District of Columbia honoring law enforcement officers. Purpose The Memorial and Museum are both projects of the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund (NLEOMF), a non-profit, 501(c)(3) organization based in Washington, D.C. The Memorial Fund maintains the Memorial, collects and analyzes information about officer fatalities and publishes research bulletins on fatality trends. As officer fatalities on roadways have increased in recent years, the NLEOMF launched the \\"Drive Safely\\" Drive Safely Website campaign to decrease law enforcement fatalities on the road. Design The architect for the museum is Davis Buckley Architects and Planners, the firm that also designed the Memorial. Plans for the museum's exhibitions include permanent galleries and one changing exhibitions gallery. The design of the permanent galleries was first undertaken by Christopher Chadbourne & Associates of Boston. When that firm closed, the design effort was completed by Studio 647 of Washington D.C. (exhibition design) and One By Design of Gloucester, MA (graphic design). Media elements were produced by Richard Lewis Media Group and Donna Lawrence Productions. The exhibits were built and installed by Design and Production Incorporated of Lorton, VA. The building is located below ground with two entrance pavilions with of interior space. The excavation for the building is below the surface. Exhibits and highlights include: * The U.S. Park Police helicopter that responded to the Air Florida Flight 90 crash into the Potomac River * A costume from the 1987 film RoboCop * A sweat shirt worn by character Jack Bauer in the TV series 24 * Artifacts of FBI Director J.

He is best known today for having been the commandant of Stalag Luft III, which is famous for a prisoner escape that was depicted in the movie The Great Escape. Military career Friedrich Wilhelm von Lindeiner genannt von Wildau was born at Glatz (K≈Çodzko, Poland) in 1880. He entered the 3. Garde-Regiment zu Fu√ü as a second lieutenant on graduating from the Corps of Cadets on 15 March 1898. On 1 May 1902 he left the Prussian Army and the following day entered the Schutztruppe for German East Africa. Here, von Lindeiner-Wildau served as the Adjutant of Gustav Adolf von G√∂tzen, the Governor of German East Africa, from 20 June to 13 September 1905 and as the Headquarters Adjutant of the Schutztruppe for German East Africa from 7 September to 11 October 1906. Von Lindeiner won the Pour le M√©rite medal, the \\"Blue Max\\". He took part in the Maji Maji Rebellion. He left Schutztruppe service on 31 July 1908 and rejoined the Prussian Army on 1 August 1908 with a simultaneous promotion to Oberleutnant and was assigned to the 4. Garde- Regiment zu Fu√ü. On 20 July 1912, on promotion to captain, von Lindeiner- Wildau was assigned as the Commander of the 11th company of 1. Garde-Regiment zu Fu√ü. World War I On 10 August 1914, he was assigned as the Commander of the Infanterie-Stabswache (\\"Infantry Staff Guard\\") at the Kaiser's General Field Headquarters. On 19 September he returned to his regiment as Commander of the 11th company, where he was wounded during the First Battle of Ypres on 17 November 1914. Returning to duty on 13 April 1915 he assumed command of the regiment's 5th company, and then of its second battalion on 27 May 1915. He was again wounded during the pursuit between the Bug River and Jasiolda on 29 August 1915. On returning to duty von Lindeiner-Wildau assumed command of the F√ºsilier battalion of 1. Garde-Regiment zu Fu√ü and was again severely wounded on 5 December 1915 in fighting around Roye-Noyon. On 24 September 1914 von Lindeiner-Wildau was assigned to Etappen-Inspektion 5 (Lines of Communication Inspectorate) and on 4 October 1916 he was assigned as the Personal Adjutant of Prince Joachim of Prussia. After his return to his Regiment on 30 October 1917 he became the Adjutant to the Governor of Riga-D√ºnam√ºnde. Appointed as Adjutant to the Garde-Reserve-Korps on 23 April 1918 he was promoted to Major on 15 July 1918. His final wartime appointment was as Adjutant of the 4th Army, a post he assumed on 8 November 1918. World War II Following the Armistice von Lindeiner-Wildau was leader of the collecting point in Potsdam of the Volunteer Border Protection Unit East and Upper East (Grenzschutz Ost/Oberost) from 18 January 1919. He retired on 20 September 1919 with permission to wear the uniform of the 1. Garde-Regiment zu Fu√ü. He worked in several civilian posts, and married a Dutch baroness.von Lindeiner-Wildau on the 'History in Film' website He spent several years in business, and travelled extensively around Europe and the Americas. As he was based in the Netherlands, von Lindeiner was able to watch the growth of Nazism from afar, and he had little time for it. When he and his wife moved to Germany in 1932, they refused to join the Nazi Party, despite the deleterious effect this had on his business and social connections. Von Lindener was a staunch supporter of Germany but an irrefutable anti-Nazi. Nevertheless, despite his manifest anti-Nazism, von Lindeiner felt obliged to accept a position in the Luftwaffe in 1937 as one of Hermann G√∂ring‚Äôs personal staff. He unsuccessfully tried to retire on the grounds of ill health, and his appointment to be the Kommandant of Stalag Luft III at Sagan (today ≈ªaga≈Ñ in Poland) in the spring of 1942 during World War II therefore represented an opportunity to serve his country without directly serving the regime he so despised. He installed himself and his family at the Jeschkendorf Manor, some 3 miles west of Sagan. Deputy Commandant Major Gustav Simoleit described von Lindeiner as an \\"honest, open- minded, liberal man [who] influenced and formed with his plans, ideas and orders the whole spirit in the relations between the prisoners and the German personnel\\". He was universally respected by both his staff and the POWs. The Gestapo investigated the escape and, whilst this uncovered no significant new information, von Lindeiner was removed and threatened with court martial. He feigned mental illness to avoid imprisonment. In February 1945, he was wounded by Russian troops advancing towards Berlin while acting as second in command of an infantry unit defending Sagan. He later surrendered to advancing British forces as the war ended. Von Lindener was imprisoned for two years at the British prisoner of war camp known as the \\"London Cage\\". He testified during the British SIB investigation concerning the Stalag Luft III murders. Allied former prisoners at Stalag Luft III testified that he had followed the Geneva Conventions concerning the treatment of POWs and had won the respect of the senior prisoners. He was repatriated in 1947. He died in 1963 at the age of 82, less than two months before the film The Great Escape was released. Awards Friedrich von Lindeiner-Wildau received the Prussian Order of the Crown 4th Class with Swords for the brutal fighting in the German East Africa campaign of 1905‚Äì07. He was also awarded the Colonial Medal with that bar. During World War I he was also awarded the Saxe-Ernestine House Order ‚Äì Knight 1st Class with Swords (1 May 1918) as Hauptmann and 1st Adjutant of the Government of Riga and the Mouth of the D√ºna, and the House Order of Hohenzollern Honor Cross 3b with Swords on 5 February 1915. He was also awarded the Iron Cross First and Second Class. Legacy Von Lindener was the basis for the character \\"Colonel von Luger\\" in the film The Great Escape, played by the actor Hannes Messemer.

Founded by the 2001 All England Open Badminton Champion, Pullela Gopichand, the facility trains several badminton players such as Saina Nehwal, P. V. Sindhu, Srikanth Kidambi, Parupalli Kashyap, H.S. Prannoy, Sai Praneeth, Sameer Verma and many others.  History  By the time he won the All England Open Badminton Championships in 2001, Pullela Gopichand was already 27 years old and was struggling with a few injuries. With not many playing years left, Gopichand decided to bring a world-class training facility for the next generation. With that intention, Gopichand decided to form a badminton academy. Soon after his well-recognized win in England, the Government of Andhra Pradesh under the leadership of Nara Chandrababu Naidu awarded him of land in 2003. The land in Hyderabad's Gachibowli area was offered as a lease at a very nominal rate for 45 years. At the same time, he started talks with Yonex for sponsorship and also wanted to involve a foreign coach. In the following year, Gopichand formulated his plans for the academy and approached Nimmagadda Prasad, a distant relative and a serial entrepreneur, to raise money for this venture. At that time, Prasad sold Matrix Laboratories, a pharmaceutical manufacturing company, to an American pharma company, Mylan Inc.. Since Prasad was convinced about Gopichand's idea, he immediately offered US$500,000 and his assistance in raising an additional amount of US$2 million. With cricket being a more popular sport, Gopichand and Prasad found it hard to raise additional money from other sources. Over time, Prasad increased his contribution to US$1.25 million. Gopichand's wife and former Olympian, P. V. V. Lakshmi, was very supportive of him and even contributed to the effort of securing monetary support. Despite other donations, Gopichand could only gather US$1.75 million. It was then he decided to mortgage his family home and raise the remaining money for the already delayed project. In 2008, the facility was eventually completed at the cost of US$2.5 million. Immediately after the construction, the Government of India sent the Commonwealth Games team to train at this facility. The government increased the daily rate they pay per player to US$20 for this special Games camp. This was a big jump from the US$5 daily fee per player that the government had previously paid for other training camps. In 2008, Gopichand appealed to Bollywood, the Hindi cinema industry to become badminton's brand ambassador. He felt that by having a popular cinema icon supporting the sport will help popularize it. Despite Saina Nehwal's success in international tournaments, Gopichand found it hard to run the Academy. To run it at an optimal level, it requires US$300,000 a year. As of 2010, he was making do with US$100,000 to pay the training cost for 60 players and was holding off hiring more coaches.  Facilities  After construction, the US$2.5 million badminton training academy contains eight courts, a swimming pool, weight training room, cafeteria and rooms to sleep. The construction of this facility was modeled after Bangalore's Prakash Padukone Badminton Academy, which is headed by Prakash Padukone. The architectural design was completed by Hyderabad-based Arvee Consultants. The wooden flooring of the courts were made as per international standards. In addition, physiotherapy, food and diet programs are also available. The second such facility is opened at the Shahid Vijay Singh Pathik Sports Complex, Greater Noida. They have recently started their unit in Salem, Tamil Nadu. There are already academies at the Gwalior, Vadodara and Hyderabad.http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/badminton/Gopichand-to- set-up-a-Badminton-Academy-in-Greater-Noida/articleshow/53301777.cms  Tournament center  The Academy has also served as a venue for major sporting events.

From the parking area on Chase Road, trails branch out through the forest holdings, a combination of open and wooded areas. Near the center of the forest, and near the top of the hill, stands the former estate house of Edith Morton Chase. It is a large two story structure, with stucco half-timbered walls in the Tudor Revival style. A central section is flanked by cross-gabled wings, with large westward projection that houses a great living room with a tall ceiling. The interior is decorated in 1920s style, and retains original fixtures and finishes. The area around the house is informally landscaped, continued the practice of Edith Morton Chase, for whom it was built. and Recreational uses The forest is open daily until sunset. In the warmer months the state sometimes offers tours of the estate house, which is otherwise closed to public access. The trails on the property support hiking and horse riding. Hunting is permitted, in season with the appropriate permits, in the forest area north of Route 118. History Creation of the forest began in 1916, when Henry Sabin Chase purchased at the summit of the hill. Chase, owner of one of the most successful metalworking business in Waterbury, died in 1917. Chase's daughter Edith took over the property, and had a rustic cottage built on the summit soon afterward. The present estate house was built in 1924, incorporating elements of the cottage into its form. The house was designed by Richard Henry Dana, a New York City architect. Miss Chase occupied the property as a summer residence, and operated much of the surrounding property, which she purchased in stages, as a farm. She bequeathed the property, then over to the people of Connecticut upon her death in 1972, along with an endowment for its maintenance.

It was the first commercial microprocessor design to be formally proven correct, although there was some controversy surrounding this claim and the definition of proof. The design was completed in 1987 and implemented initially by RSRE in a gate array. Marconi Electronics subsequently licensed the design, implementing it as the MAS1908 VIPER-1, fabricated using CMOS and silicon-on-sapphire technologies, being packaged as a 120-pin grid array product.

Although employing a uniform instruction layout suggestive of RISC architectures, instruction execution times vary from 6 to 26 clock cycles, in contrast to a throughput of one instruction per cycle sought by conventional RISC architectures. A safety critical programming language named Newspeak was designed by Ian Currie of RSRE in 1984 for use with VIPER. Its principal characteristic was that all exceptional behaviour in programs must be dealt with at compile time.

The Arc Trainer is manufactured in Owatonna MN. First introduced in 2003, the Arc Trainer‚Äôs footplates move in an arcuate path of motion as opposed to the elliptical pattern seen in elliptical trainers. The arc pattern of motion is a patented technology,Covered by the following US utility patents : US7,568,999, US7,278,955 designed to generate force only when the user is in the load- bearing phase of the gait cycle. This generates forces in the legs which balance the loading between the hip and knee joints.Graves, Sue B. and Juris, Paul M. (Arc Trainer vs. Elliptical Study 3-21-2007). A Comparative kinematic and Biomechanical Analysis of Two Gait Simulators The result of this balanced loading design creates less stress on the knee joint and allows higher muscle training effect with lower perceived exertion. Turner, MJ, Williams, AB, Williford, AL, & Cordova, ML. (2010). A Comparison of physiologic and physical discomfort responses between exercise modalities. Journal of Strength & Conditioning Research, 24(3), 796-803. Like an elliptical trainer, the Arc Trainer is considered to be an example of a weight-bearing form of exercise that is linked to prevention of osteoporosis.Dalsky, G., Stocke, K., Ehsani, A., Slatopolsky, E., Lee, W., Birge, Jr, S. (1988 June). Weight-Bearing Exercise Training and Lumbar Bone mineral Content in Postmenopausal Women It is comparable to a treadmill in its ability to induce heart muscle activity, but reduces the impact shock typically associated with treadmill running. The Arc Trainer is adjustable for incline and resistance and has a variable stride rate. Resistance settings are proportional to body-weight such that the same amount of relative work is performed by a 110 lb female and a 250 lb male when the same resistance level is selected. There are two versions of the Arc Trainer, a lower body version and a total body version. The Total Body Arc Trainer uses a same side forward pattern of motion where the arm and leg on the same side move together. This movement pattern allows the user to transfer work to their upper body without simultaneously increasing the work rate of the legs.

He has written and recorded four studio albums, performed internationally and been compared to such composers as Philip Glass and Steve Reich. In August 2019, he became the Vice Chancellor and CEO of Regent's University London, having formerly served as the Senior Deputy Vice Chancellor of Falmouth University and Head of Music & Performing Arts at Bath Spa University.  Education  Smith earned his BA in Music from the University of Nottingham before an MPhil in Electronic Music from the University of Oxford and a PhD in Composition from the University of Huddersfield (where he was supervised by the composer Gavin Bryars). He also holds an MBA in Higher Education Management from the Institute of Education at University College London.  Career  Along with his wife, singer Nicola Walker Smith (born 1964), he has written and recorded numerous pieces of music and published American Originals (Faber & Faber, 1995); a book of interviews with American contemporary composers such as John Cage, Philip Glass, Laurie Anderson and Terry Riley. Although strongly influenced by American composers, much of Smith's musical work borrows lyric content from traditional English verse and Romantic poets such as Emily Bront√´, John Keats, Christina Rossetti, Percy Bysshe Shelley, and Elizabeth Siddal. Following the release of his first album Gas Food Lodging (1993) with independent label Kitchenware Records, Smith signed a record deal with Sony Classical and a publishing contract with EMI. His second album, 15 Wild Decembers (1995), was produced by Steve Nye in New York, whilst his third album Black Flowers (1997) was produced at AIR Studios in London. In 2014, after fourteen years of inactivity, Smith recorded a new album Black is the Colour (2014) and released it digitally via Bandcamp. His academic career began as a lecturer at the universities of Manchester and Huddersfield before joining Bath Spa University as Head of Music in 1998. In 2002, he founded the School of Music and Performing Arts at Bath Spa which was recognized as a national Centre of Excellence in Teaching and Learning in 2005. Later that year, aged 38, Smith was awarded a professorial title for ‚Äòoutstanding qualities of academic leadership‚Äô. In November 2008, he joined Falmouth University as Senior Deputy Vice Chancellor where he expanded the university‚Äôs academic portfolio and developed a range of national and international partnerships. He also led the development of the university‚Äôs online brand, 'Falmouth Flexible', and authored the '2030 Portfolio Strategy' for the building of a pedagogy fit for the '4th Industrial Revolution'. In August 2019, he was appointed Vice Chancellor and CEO of Regent's University London and in April 2020 announced that he would donate 20% of his monthly salary back to the University in response to the financial pressures of the COVID-19 pandemic. He is also a Trustee of Trinity College London.

From 1909 to 1919, Esval was educated at the Norwegian National Academy of Craft and Art Industry. Esval trained at the Acad√©mie de l'Art Moderne in Paris under Othon Friesz and Raoul Dufy from 1919 to 1921. Esval studied at the Acad√©mie Scandinave also called Maison Watteau in Paris under Per Krogh from 1926 to 1927, and at the Norwegian National Academy of Fine Arts under Georg Jacobsen 1935-1937. Also during his career, Esval taught drawing at the Norwegian National Academy of Craft and Art Industry. Esval was primarily a landscape painter that performed a series of quiet Norwegian landscapes constructed by geometric principles. Esval lived in several local farms in Gudbrandsdal, Norway during the 1950s and 1960s. The painting Ringebu Kirke is an example of the many landscape scenes he obtained from the Norwegian valleys. In 1928, Esval made the stained glass windows of Tangen Chursh in Drammen, Norway. Additionally Esval did portrait painting including subjects such as Ruth Maier who was a model for Esval during her time in Norway. Maier was an Austrian woman whose diaries describing her experiences of the Holocaust in Austria and Norway were published in 2007 by Norwegian poet Jan Erik Vold, leading her to be described as \\"Norway's Anne Frank.\\" Maier was deported to Auschwitz in November 1942, where she was killed on arrival, aged only twenty-two. Beginning in 1928, Esval was a regular participant in the Autumn Exhibition or National Art Exhibition in Oslo. Esval is represented in the Norwegian National Gallery of Art, Norwegian National Touring Exhibitions and Norwegian Royal Gallery.

Occupied by several institutions since the expulsion of the friars during the French Revolution, it is currently used as a student dormitory and the former chapel serves as a concert hall, particularly as the base of the orchestral group, Les Musiciens du Louvre.Musiciens du Louvre Grenoble Minim monastery=Founding The Minim friars had founded their first monastery in the region, the Minim Monastery of the Plains, in 1494, in the village of Saint-Martin-d'H√®res on the outskirts of Grenoble. It became established as the motherhouse of the Order for France. Over time, many prominent figures of the region came to be interred in its chapel, people such as the Chevalier de Bayard, a noted military commander of the early 16th century. During the 17th century, in the course of a major religious revival which swept France, the friars decided that they wanted to relocate to within the city walls of Grenoble, where they could be more accessible to the faithful. In 1642 they acquired some property in the city and wished to build on that. In November of the following year, they obtained the reluctant permission of the Bishop of Grenoble, Pierre Scarron, for the project. The bishop, however, demanded assurances from the Order that this new foundation would not interfere with the operation of the Monastery of the Plains. An inheritance which the monastery received from a local widow in 1644 permitted the work to commence. Scarron, however, withdrew his permission a year later, this despite the fact that construction was already underway. It took the issuance of letters patent by King Louis XIV in January 1646 for the construction to go forward to completion. Later history The Minim friars followed a fairly monastic routine of life, supplying their own needs through the labor of the friars, whether tailors or stonemasons. The presence of a stable attests to a certain level of traffic by the friars in their work. In 1671, the friars began to complain to the authorities that their solitude was being disrupted by hymn singing coming from the Huguenot church located near their monastery. By a royal decree, the Protestant congregation was forced to move out of the city. The grounds on which their church stood was then appropriated and a seminary was built for the local diocese on the site. In 1707 construction was begun on a wall to enclose the monastery grounds, uniting the various buildings within its confines. Despite their assurances to Bishop Scarron (+1668), the friars eventually came to abandon the original monastery. As had been the case with that institution, the prominent of the city wished to be buried in chapel of the new monastery. The regional lawyers' association held their meetings and housed their library there from 1748 to 1776. When the monastery was founded, the Minims agreed to the use of the chapel as the meeting place of a fraternity of the Third Order of the Trinitarian Order, who had been founded in the 13th century for the rescue of Christians enslaved by Muslim forces. Possibly due to this connection, the monastery came to host a group of 48 slaves who arrived on 6 September 1785, requiring the friars to purchase sufficient straw mattresses and blankets for the comfort of their guests. The two days that the group stayed there was considered a notable event in the city history. At the time this event took place, the city authorities were drawing up a plan to take possession of the monastery, whose occupants had dwindled to five friars. The proposal was to convert the monastery buildings into barracks for military use. The outbreak of the French Revolution put a stop to the project. Later use Under the policies of Revolutionary France, in 1790 all religious orders were suppressed. The monastery was declared state property and confiscated and the friars were expelled. The monastery buildings were soon converted into workshops where tradesmen such as blacksmiths and carpenters could conduct their craft. When a concordat was signed between the Emperor Napoleon and Pope Pius VII in 1801, the Catholic Church was again allowed to function publicly. The next year, the local bishop was able to retrieve possession of this monastery, which by then was badly damaged. The city authorities of Grenoble had tried to block this return of the complex to the Church but were unsuccessful. They soon arranged to purchase it from the local bishop, which was accomplished on 10 August 1803. Seminary Shortly thereafter, however, the new Bishop of Grenoble, Claude Simon, began to seek a site for the establishment of a new seminary, as the previous one had been destroyed. With the help of the city's mayor, he was able to obtain the use of the former monastery for this purpose, and permission for this was granted by the emperor in 1806. The necessary renovations were made and the new facility opened its doors on 3 November of that year. The chapel was solemnly re-consecrated on the following 23 March. The seminary chapel was to become the site of ordination of two men later acclaimed as saints by the Catholic Church. The first was that of the famed priest John Vianney, although he was not a student of the school, in 1815. The other was that in 1834 of Peter Julian Eymard, who went on to found a religious congregation dedicated to evangelization focused on the Blessed Sacrament. Enrollment at the seminary reached its peak in 1875, with 150 seminarians attending it. Although the seminary was operating in the facilities, the buildings remained government property, the city having sold it in 1811 to the Prefecture of Grenoble. University and conservatory courtyard of the monastery The French government passed a series of measures on 9 December 1905 which were intended to enact a strict separation of the Church from the State. This resulted in the expulsion of the seminary in Grenoble from its location, and the seizure of all its possessions. The prefecture sold the property to the University of Grenoble in 1913. When World War I broke out on 4 August 1914, however, the buildings were occupied by the French army. It was five years before the university was able to retake possession of the property, by then badly damaged. Repairs were made and the buildings became a student dormitory. During the Second World War, part of the facilities were made available to the Conservatory of Grenoble, which had lost its own location. This organization remained there until 1970, at which time badly needed repairs were made to the buildings. In November 1979, title to the building was transferred to the National Ministry of Education. The former chapel has been converted into a concert hall and was renamed Olivier Messiaen Hall on 1 October 1981.

Their seniors have won the Tyrone Hurling Championship a record 26 times, with the most recent in 2017, and their first in 1972. Founding While memories exist of the ancient game of cam√°n, a precursor to the modern game of hurling, having been played locally in the 19th century, it was not until 1968 that hurling was revived in the parish by Kerryman Gerry Ryle. Gerry had come to teach at Dean Brian Maguirc School and upon coming across unused hurleys in the school gym in 1968, hurling came to life in Carrickmore. From that point Gerry bestowed his passion and enthusiasm for the game hurling upon the youth of the Dean who continued their interest after leaving school to the natural progression of forming Carrickmore's hurling club under the umbrella of St. Columecille's in 1970.. However, it was not until 1974 that the club was named √âire √ìg and separated from the football club. Achievements In 1970, history was made when the Juveniles won the Tyrone Championship, beating Dungannon in the final The club struggled to survive in those early days and only for the determination of people like Oliver Kerr, the club would not have made it. In 1976, the club colours of black and amber, inspired by All Ireland winning champions Kilkenny, were first worn. The Seniors first won the County Championship and took home the Benburb Cup in 1972, and during the 70s twice again took it back but it was during the 80s that √âire √ìg first had its great success with the underage players of the 70s coming of age. They won the County Championship a remarkable 8 times in a row from 1982 to 1989. By 1990 they had appeared in the County final a staggering 13 times in a row. In 1998, the Seniors broke through to the next level and won the Ulster Shield, while in 2001, the Dean won their first Ulster Vocational Schools U16 championship and then the Minors won the Ulster Championship in 2003. Success was had as well in the Armagh League which was won for the first time in 2004, the historic year of the \\"clean sweep\\" in which Carrickmore hurlers and footballers won all county titles at all levels, while the U16s won their first Armagh League title in 2006. Camogie The woman's game Camogie was established in the parish in 1978, and flourished until 1989. During those years the camogs enjoyed a lot of success and participated at U14, Minor, U21 and Senior while a number of the players also represented Tyrone at county level. However in Camogie's centenary year 2004, Camogie was re-established in Carrickmore under √âire √ìg by Br√≠d U√≠ Dhonnghaile and they now compete at U10, Post Primary, U14, U16, Minors and seniors.

Warren (September 11, 1924 - December 30, 2000) was an American electric blues guitarist, bass player and singer. In a long career, he worked with Otis Rush, Al Benson, Little Sonny Cooper, David Honeyboy Edwards, Baby Boy Warren, Guitar Slim, Freddie King, Jimmy Reed, Morris Pejoe, Bobo Jenkins and Jim McCarty. One of Warren's better-known recordings was \\"Baby Likes to Boogie\\". He was described by the Allmusic journalist Michael G. Nastos as \\"one of the Midwest's true blues treasures\\". Biography Warren was born in Stamps, Arkansas, and moved with his family to Lake Village, Arkansas, when he was 13 years old. He was taught by Caleb King to play the guitar, and played in his own blues ensemble around the Mississippi Delta. He taught guitar techniques to his band's singer, Guitar Slim, and they toured around Louisiana in the latter half of the 1940s. Warren relocated to Chicago by the early 1950s and joined Otis Rush's band. He later played alongside Freddie King and Jimmy Reed, and he backed Morris Pejoe on tracks recorded for Chess Records. Back in Arkansas in 1959, Warren formed the House Rockers. By the early 1970s he had moved to Detroit to work and record with Bobo Jenkins. From 1974 to 1976 he was also a featured performer, along with Baby Boy Warren (no relation), with the Progressive Blues Band, a popular blues band that performed in many of Detroit's best blues venues. When Baby Boy Warren died, in 1977, Willie D. Warren took up the duties of frontman for the band. In 1977, Warren recorded his first solo album, which was released on Jenkins's label, Big Star. Warren also wrote songs, including two‚Äî\\"Door Lock Blues\\" and \\"Detroit Jump\\"‚Äîthat Jenkins recorded for his album Detroit All Purpose Blues. Warren's recordings have been issued on two compilation albums. His live album, Live, recorded for the No Cover Productions label, was not released until after Warren's death. His backing band at that time, Mystery Train, included his old friend Jim McCarty. Warren died in Detroit, in December 2000, at the age of 76. He left one son, Willie Hairston.

His wife Cornelia van der Gon was the rich heiress of the Amsterdam architect Adriaan Dortsman (ca. 1636-1682), who designed the round Lutheran church on the Singel. The marriage was childless, and Cornelia spent her time on her doll houses, which Dortsman had helped design and which Van der Plas helped decorate. The landscape painter Jan Wijnants also painted miniatures for these doll houses. Cornelia died in 1701, and after the death of Van der Plas, the doll houses were sold at auction to Sara Roth√©, who used them to decorate her own doll houses.

Simultaneously, Bakaleinikov was Professor of Viola at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory (1918‚Äì1920) and at the Moscow Conservatory (1920‚Äì1924). As Professor of Viola, Bakaleinikov was a pioneer in promoting artistic standards for the instrument. Among his students were, in particular, Vadim Borisovsky who succeeded him as Professor of Viola at the Conservatory. In 1925‚Äì1926, Bakaleinikov, together with his wife, singer and actress Julia Fatova (–Æ–ª–∏—è –§–∞—Ç–æ–≤–∞; Yulia Fatova), went to the United States with the Moscow Art Theater Music Studio on a highly successful tour.Scope of Soviet Activity in the United States: No Room for Art (1957) Retrieved 15 October 2010. At the invitation of the conductor Fritz Reiner, Bakaleinikov was appointed assistant conductor and principal violist of the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra (1927‚Äì1937). In 1937, following the lead of his two younger brothers, he moved to Hollywood to work in film. He was also associate conductor of the Los Angeles Philharmonic.Lorin Maazel biography Retrieved 15 October 2010. During this time, Bakaleinikov began conducting lessons with seven-year-old Lorin Maazel. In 1938, Bakaleinikov again accepted an invitation from Reiner, then principal conductor of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, to be his assistant. The Maazel family followed Bakaleinikov to Pittsburgh so that the young conductor could continue working with his teacher. Between Reiner's departure from Pittsburgh in 1948 and the arrival of his successor William Steinberg in 1952, Bakaleinikov served as musical director of the Orchestra.Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh: Vladimir & Julia Bakaleinikoff Retrieved 15 October 2010.

At the age of thirteen, he began his artistic education in the Paris studio of the engraver Joseph Burn-Smeeton. By the mid-1870s, Lep√®re had emerged as one of the most renowned printmakers of his time. Lep√®re focused mostly on daily life in both his etchings and wood engravings. He is now remembered for his innovations, such as the use of colored paper and the combining of etching and wood engraving on the same print. The last years of Lep√®re's life were given almost exclusively to wood engraving. In total, his graphic oeuvre consists of over 150 etchings, over 200 wood engravings and 14 lithographs.

The hotel is managed by Fairmont Hotels and Resorts and owned by a company led by Great Century. Overview=History The ¬£50 million resort opened in June 2001 as St Andrews Bay Golf Resort & Spa owned by US entrepreneur Don Panoz, as part of the Ch√¢teau √âlan Hotels & Resorts consortium. In 2006 the resort was bought by Apollo Real Estate Advisors (renamed AREA Property Partners) and is now managed by FRHI Hotels & Resorts. This prompted a name change to Fairmont St Andrews Bay. In August 2014 it was announced Kennedy Wilson Real Estate PLC had purchased the property, with FRHI Hotel & Resorts continuing to manage the hotel and its operations. Refurbishment In 2008-9 the resort underwent a ¬£17 million renovation, with all 209 guest rooms and the Signature Spa refurbished. The public areas were also upgraded, including the lobby, corridors, atrium and Kittocks Bar. The Rock and Spindle bar had been opened the previous year, and the conference centre had also been refurbished. At this time the two golf courses were also altered and the Devlin Course was renamed the Kittocks Course. In 2017, Fairmont St Andrews Bay underwent another multi-million pound renovation. Managed by designers RPW, the redevelopment was influenced by the history and landscapes of St Andrews and involved a complete redesign of the hotel‚Äôs Atrium. Resort Facilities=Rooms An Executive Suite The resort has 211 bedrooms including 17 suites and two external Manor Homes. The hotel has four types of suites: Studio, Junior, Deluxe and Executive as well as the Kingdom of Fife Suite, the hotel‚Äôs largest accommodation. Restaurants The resort has six dining outlets which offer a variety of cuisines. *La Cucina is an Italian eatery offering simple dishes.

In 2009 the course was redesigned to include eight new holes, in preparation for the 2009 Scottish Seniors Open and was also the Final Qualifying Venue for the 2010 Open Golf Championship. In August 2010 the World Deaf Golf Championships and the Scottish Seniors Open 2010 were held on the Torrance. The course features classic Scottish revetted bunkering throughout and is of a Scottish style Links design. The Kittocks Course is 7,192 yard long and is a Par 72. Its original architects were Gene Sarazen and Bruce Devlin which is why it was formerly known as the Devlin Course 2012. The name Kittocks is taken from the SSSI (Site of Special Scientific Interest) area of land on the course which is inhabited by a family of deer. =Spa= The health spa at Fairmont St Andrews Bay is situated on the ground floor of the hotel. Its facilities include a 16-metre swimming pool, a spa bath, a sauna and a steam room as well as a fitness studio.

Role in Spooks=Character arc Dimitri was born in North London on 17 March 1974 to Greek immigrant parents, and formerly served as a soldier in the Royal Marines and latterly in the SBS, but left in unknown circumstances. He consequently joined MI5 as their Piracy and Terrorism Case Officer. His first mission saw him face off Somali terrorists, who hijacked a vessel with the intention of bombing the Houses of Parliament in London. The attack was stopped by the detonation of an EMP bomb beneath London. Following this, Dimitri serves as a field operative, assisting on numerous missions, frequently as armed backup. Over the course of his employment, he forms a bond with his superior, Lucas North (Richard Armitage), responsible for the integration of both Dimitri and Beth Bailey (Sophia Myles) into the team. In Episode 4, Chinese intelligence plant a van full of explosives in a busy London street. Dimitri consequently goes there, and heroically risks his life, evacuating the area and then defusing the bomb. Characteristics Dimitri is shown to be a courageous and heroic agent, as well as an excellent spy. His approach to spying is described as 'more relaxed than Lucas', and he is depicted as a friendly and open character, who is 'consistently brilliant at his job', but 'just likes to enjoy himself.' He looks upon Lucas as a friend and mentor, and has a good relationship with other members of the team, particularly Beth, with whom he shares the experience of being new to the job. In his personal file, Dimitri is described as determined, energetic, fearless and instinctive. He specialises in piracy and counter-terrorism. In the tenth series, Dimitri is a lot more experienced and has a much stronger voice in the team. He has a very close relationship to the new Section Chief Erin Watts. She affectionately calls him 'D'. He was also the one to whom she turned for comfort after her daughter was used as part of a terrorist plot against London. They are also shown holding hands and embracing after Ruth's death. He also shows an extremely strong loyalty to Harry even when the team leader decides to go behind the rules to figure out who had ordered the attacks against the MI5 and Ilya Gavrik.

Genome sequencing and comparison have revealed the existence of four tensin genes in humans. These genes appear to be related by ancient instances of gene duplication. Tensin binds to actin filaments and contains a phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain at the C-terminus, which interacts with the cytoplasmic tail of Œ≤ integrins. These interactions allow tensin to link actin filaments to integrin receptors. Several factors induce tyrosine phosphorylation of tensin. Thus, tensin functions as a platform for assembly and disassembly of signaling complexes at focal adhesions by recruiting tyrosine-phosphorylated signaling molecules, and also by providing interaction sites for other proteins. Haynie, by contrast, argues in a review of tensin structure and function that experimental evidence for the specific association of tensin with actin filaments is inconclusive at best. Recent work has also demonstrated TNS3 and TNS4 to exhibit force-dependent recruitment to keratin network in epithelial cells, highlighting its novel role in mechanotransduction. It is beyond reasonable doubt, however, that tensin 1, tensin 2 and tensin 3 each contains a protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) domain near the N-terminus. The PTP domain is unlikely to be active in tensin 1, owing to mutation of the essential nucleophilic cysteine in the signature motif to asparagine. Nevertheless, phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate 3-phosphatase, the well-studied tumor suppressor that is better known as PTEN, gets its name from homology with PTPs and tensin 1. More detailed structure comparisons have revealed that tensins 1-3, PTEN, auxilin and other proteins in animals, plants and fungi comprise a PTP-C2 superdomain. An integrated PTP domain and C2 domain, the PTP-C2 superdomain came into existence over 1 billion years ago and has functioned as a single heritable unit since then. The first tensin cDNA sequence was isolated from chicken. Analysis of knockout mice has demonstrated critical roles of tensin in renal function, muscle regeneration, and cell migration. Evidence is now emerging to suggest tensin is an important component linking the ECM, the actin cytoskeleton, and signal transduction. Therefore, tensin and its downstream signaling molecules may be targets for therapeutic interventions in renal disease, wound healing and cancer.

Khaisman's subject matter has come from various sources, including art history, old movies, 20th century propaganda art, and his own photographs. Khaisman was a practicing architect for two decades, working in the areas of architecture, animation, and stained glass design, before he began to exhibit his tape works in 2005. He was inspired to create works with packaging tape when he looked at a tape-covered stained glass work in progress and saw beauty in the patterns made by the tape. Since 2005, his work has been exhibited by a number of galleries, mostly located in Philadelphia or in nearby areas of Pennsylvania and New Jersey. He has also exhibited in non-gallery spaces, including Philadelphia International Airport and the headquarters of Urban Outfitters. Biography Khaisman studied Art and Architecture at the Moscow Architectural Institute in 1982. While in college he participated in number of international conceptual architecture competitions. In 1983, he was accepted as a member at Moscow Artist Association, and from 1983 to 1989 he worked as a member at State Animation Studio as the art director for seven puppet animation movies. He teamed with Lev Evzovitch on his conceptual architecture and art projects; Evzovitch who later formed the art group AES+F.

Influenced by such illustrative comic-strip artists as Hal Foster and Alex Raymond, Katz attended the School of Industrial Art in New York City. He began working for comic-book publishers in the 1940s, during the period fans and historians call the Golden Age of Comic Books. Though continuing to work in comics through the 1950s, his slow pace and highly detailed, idiosyncratic art style prompted him to leave that field for 14 years. Circa 1969, he returned to mainstream color comics as well as to black- and-white horror-comics magazines, and after a move to California embarked upon The First Kingdom, a serialized work that later became considered a precursor to, or an early form of, the graphic novel. He completed it in 1986, and went on to write and draw further works in that vein, and to teach art. Early life and career Katz was born in Brooklyn, New York, and moved to Canada days after he was born. He returned to the United States when he was around eight years old.Amash (2010), p. 3Zimmerman (1982), p. 38 While attending the School of Industrial Art in New York City, he established bonds of friendship with future comic artists Alex Toth, Alfonso Greene and Pete Morisi. Katz's work in mainstream comics spans both the Golden and Silver Ages, and was done under a variety of pseudonyms such as Jay Hawk, Vaughn Beering, Alac Justice, Alec Justice, and David Hadley.Amash (2010), p. 4Zimmerman (1982), p. 54 He got his start in the industry in 1943, working in the C. C. Beck and Pete Costanza studio on that duo's feature Bulletman.Amash (2010), p. 5 In 1944 or 1945, working as a letterer in the comics studio of Jerry Iger, he became acquainted with artist Matt Baker, whom he considered \\"one of the top illustrators, and a good storyteller\\". From 1946 to 1951, he worked as an art assistant on various King Features Syndicate comic strips. Katz worked on Thimble Theatre as an assistant artist, working with Bela Zaboly and Louis Trakis. Katz worked briefly on Terry and the Pirates as an assistant to George Wunder. As a \\"detail man\\", he came into contact with Hal Foster and Alex Raymond, two of the artists who inspired him most in his early years. Katz has considered Foster his \\"guiding light\\" since the age of six and believes Foster laid the foundations for the graphic novel. Raymond praised Katz's illustrative style and said that working in comics was a waste of his time. Stanley Kaye, on the other hand, told Katz to persevere.Amash (2010), p. 17 Exciting War #6, Standard Comics, art by Jack Katz, inks by Aldo Rubano, Nov 1952. Katz went to work for Standard Comics and its imprints in 1951, doing horror comics, war comics and some romance comics until the company went out of business. From this period comes some of the earliest work that can be identified as his, such as Adventures into Darkness #10 (June 1953).Amash (2010), p. 21 From 1952 to 1956, Katz worked as a penciler and inker at the studio of Jack Kirby and Joe Simon, working alongside Mort Meskin and Marvin Stein. Kirby taught Katz how to ink and use lighting to emphasize dramatic scenes.Amash (2010), pp. 37‚Äì38 A slow worker due to heavy detailing (influenced by the style of illustrator Dean Cornwell), Katz was let go and moved on to Timely Comics under Stan Lee around 1954.Amash (2010), p. 40Zimmerman (1982), p. 37 Katz worked on war and horror comics, as well as Westerns, but his pacing continued to cause friction. Without Lee's knowledge, Katz worked on the side for Fiction House, which slowed him down even more.Amash (2010), p. 46 In 1955 he left mainstream comics to paint and teach art, both privately and for the YMCA in New York City. His hiatus from the industry lasted 14 years. Impressed by Jim Steranko's Captain America, Katz entered mainstream comics for a second time in 1969 and bounced around from job to job.Levin (2005), p. 199 He first found work with Stan Lee at Marvel Comics and worked on books such as Sub-Mariner, Monsters on the Prowl and Adventure into Fear. Katz then worked on House of Secrets and romance comics for DC before moving on to write and illustrate stories for Jim Warren.Amash (2010), p. 48 In the early 1970s, Katz drew numerous romance comics for DC and Marvel Comics. Katz got a job with Skywald Publications around 1970, where he believed that he would be able to write his own stories. While there he worked on \\"Zangar\\" (from the Jungle Adventures comic book) and is credited with the full art and script for \\"The Plastic Plague\\" in the horror-comics magazine Nightmare #14 (Aug. 1973).Amash (2010), p. 50 While remaining with Skywald as an associate editor, Katz moved to California in the early 1970s. It was there he began writing The First Kingdom, integrating into the story ideas that he'd had since his time with Warren Publications.Amash (2010), p. 53 In 1978, Katz teamed up with his friend Thomas Scortia to create a short-lived comic strip, Galactic Prime. The strip was launched on July 5, 1978, and ran for only seven weeks in his local newspaper, the North East Bay Independent and Gazette. The First Kingdom Moving to California led to Katz's introduction to underground comics. Through independent publishing he saw the potential to create his own story without editorial interference.Amash (2010), p. 54 The First Kingdom is a 24-issue, 768-page graphic novel that took Katz 12 years to complete, outside of writing the story. He finished two books per year, intentionally totaling 24 in order to mirror the number of books in Homer's Iliad and Odyssey.Amash (2010), p. 56 Each issue is dedicated to his then- wife, Carolyn. The epic was published by Comics & Comix Co. from 1974 to 1977, at which point publication was taken over by Bud Plant (a Comics & Comix co- founder) and completed in 1986. Early praise for Kingdom came from Playboy magazine and the Rocket's Blast Comicollector fanzine,Amash (2010), p. 55 but it was never a commercial success due in part to the frequency with which it came out and its adult content.Levin (2005), p. 197 Another contributing factor may have been that Kingdom was sold strictly through mail-order, specialty comic stores and head shops. Its genre is science fiction-fantasy with a heavier emphasis on science fiction after issue #6. The story opens on a new, post-nuclear era with tribes fighting for survival on a primitive, fantastic Earth filled with gods and monsters. Gods meddle in human affairs, their appearance, temperament and vices resembling the gods of Ancient Greece. The story spans generations and has a huge cast of characters. It abounds with theories to account for religion, evolution, migration and why humans allow themselves to be distracted from the, \\"plaguing questions of our existence\\". The story's protagonist, Tundran, is introduced in Book Four. He overcomes obstacles in order to return to his father's usurped kingdom of Moorengan as a liberator. Along the way he falls in love with Fara, a \\"transgoddess\\" incarnate, and their adventures together represent the most linear plot line in the story. The First Kingdom is the first part of a trilogy, which Katz said will include Space Explorers Club and Destiny. He said the first 20 issues are the introduction to the real Kingdom story in issues #21‚Äì24. The first 20 issues are filled with histories that are interwoven and repeat the same doomed cycle: a hard-won ascent from primitivity blossoms into a golden age of scientific advancement which inevitably devolves into war and a preoccupation with survival and superstition. Katz's fears concerning the human condition are revealed here. His characters are unable to transcend their \\"early programming\\" born out of environmental stresses and cannot escape such base motivations as greed, envy, and jealousy. The chance for humanity to break this cycle comes with the arrival of Queltar in #20, who encourages a select few to join him and embrace their true potential among the stars. A number of stylistic touches set Katz's illustrative style in Kingdom apart from that of other comic artists. It is highly detailed' all of his human (and humanoid) forms have ideal, heroic bodies rendered with anatomical accuracy; and there are no gutters, with murals filling single-panel pages throughout the work. The quality of Katz's art matures as he progresses further into the story: the panels get larger and he shifts from pen to brush in the fifth book, a suggestion from Jim Steranko.Sherman (1977), p. 55 Will Eisner and Jerry SiegelKatz (1978), inside cover among many others considered Kingdom to be innovative in many respects. In the foreword to issue #23, Eisner claims the work helped carve a niche for the graphic-novel medium. Comics historian R. C. Harvey believes Katz was the \\"...first person in comics to pursue a personal vision at such length'\\".Levin (2005), p. 204 Katz's stated intention in the first issue was to trailblaze: \\"The work I am undertaking...is the first in a series of books in which I hope to extend the dimension of comics to the potential art form that one of its earliest and greatest artists, Hal Foster, laid down the foundations for.\\"Katz (1974), inside cover Attempts have been made to reissue Kingdom as collected volumes. Wallaby Pocket Books published a large-format version of the first six books in 1978. In 2005, Century Comics (under its former name, Mecca Comics Group) released the first volume of an anticipated four-volume set, collecting issues #1‚Äì6. The second volume collected issues #7‚Äì12 and followed months later, but Century Comics went out of business before it could publish the final two volumes. In May 2013, Titan Comics announced plans to reprint the series in six volumes, remastered from the original art and relettered. Later life and career alt=A photo of Katz in his studio.Since the Kingdom years, Katz has focused on teaching art at a community college in Albany, California, painting and working on graphic novels. Students of his have helped publish a number of books of his works. These include an anatomy book for students (Anatomy by Jack Katz, Volume One) and two books of his sketches (Jack Katz Sketches, Vol. 1 and Jack Katz Sketches, Vol. 2). In 2009, Graphic Novel Literature published Katz's second graphic novel, Legacy. Charlie Novinskie, former president of Century Comics, helped script Legacy. Katz's painting style, like his comic art style, focuses on human subjects and anatomy. \\"The figures in the paintings...embrace, entwine, writhe, contort, and suckle. The work blends the realistic with the exaggerated. It is a 1930s, 1940s world, its view unimpeded by fifty years of art trends and theory. The Ashcan School comes to mind.\\"Levin (2005), p. 198 Awards Katz was one of the recipients of the Inkpot Award in 1976 at the San Diego Comic-Con.

The film features most of the cast from the original film reprising their roles, and follows Hiccup and his young fellows accompanying their mentor, Gobber, on a quest to kill the legendary Boneknapper Dragon. It originally aired on television via Cartoon Network on October 14, 2010, and was released as a special feature on Blu-ray and double DVD editions of How to Train Your Dragon the next day. Plot The film opens with Gobber's house on fire and the Vikings and resident dragons getting it under control. Gobber is convinced that his old nemesis The Boneknapper Dragon, a giant, yet perfectly silent dragon (the only one with no roar) that clothes itself in bones for armor, is responsible. However no one else believes that the Boneknapper even exists, much less that it burned his house, especially when the evidence suggests that the fire was started by his underwear drying at his hearth and catching fire. Undeterred, Gobber vows to hunt down the beast once and for all and Hiccup reluctantly decides that he cannot let his mentor go alone, so he convinces his Viking recruit comrades to join him as well. As the gang row to the island where Gobber believes the dragon lives, Gobber tells them of his past encounters with the monster, shown to the viewer in traditional animation. He apparently first met it when he discovered a group of frozen Vikings after he relieved himself on an iceberg during a family outing and he extracted a small treasure chest from the ice. As the frozen Viking he stole it from resisted by punching him in the face a couple of times, the Boneknapper appeared and chased him until he landed back in the family boat. The contents of the chest turn out to be a small bone that Gobber has since used as a belt buckle. The stories continue, becoming increasingly ridiculous as Gobber tells of later encounters with the Boneknapper being interfered with by hammerhead sharks, a hammerhead whale, a hammerhead yak jumping out of an active volcano and the Norse thunder god Thor. Unfortunately, the group's attention is so occupied that they allow their boat to run aground and sink. Taking the loss of their only way home in stride, Gobber sets up a trap using Fishlegs as bait. The gang still refuses to believe Gobber's claims, but unfortunately, a real Boneknapper silently comes up from behind the group and Fishlegs' attempts to warn them are ignored until it is in position to attack. At the same time, the Boneknapper makes a squeaky sound in its failed attempt to roar. Realizing that Gobber was telling the truth about the Boneknapper all along, the gang has to take shelter inside their own trap. All seems lost, but Hiccup sees an empty spot on the dragon's neck armor that exactly resembles Gobber's belt buckle bone. Hiccup realizes that the Boneknapper may simply be seeking to reclaim it from Gobber to complete his armor and be able to roar. Gobber initially refuses to heed Hiccup's advice to placate the creature. However, he is soon seized by the beast and finally gives in. He throws the bone back at the dragon; the bone lands perfectly in the empty spot and the dragon is finally able to triumphantly roar with his armor completed. As it turns out, the satisfied Boneknapper is a friendly one and Gobber finally develops a newfound love and respect for the creature. The adventurers then ride the Boneknapper, presumably towards Berk. As Fishlegs informs the others that the dragon's roar is a mating call, four other Boneknappers appear from the distance. Gobber notes that he will definitely be believed this time.

Built in 1812, it is a fine local example of Federal architecture. It was owned for many years by members of the locally prominent Bourne family. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on January 24, 1980. Description and history The Bourne House in 2014 The Bourne Mansion is set on the west side of Bourne Street, in a small residential area north of United States Route 1 in the town center. It is a three-story wood frame structure, with a low-pitch hip roof, clapboard siding, and a granite foundation. The main facade faces south, and is five bays wide, with a central entrance flanked by sidelight windows and Tuscan pilasters, and is topped by a fan-light window. Above this entrance is a Palladian window. There is a secondary entrance on the street-facing eastern facade, with Ionic pilasters supporting an entablature, with a fanlight just below. A single- story addition, built in the late 19th century, extends to the north. The interior has retained its elegant Federal finish, including a wide central hallway and a fine central spiral staircase. The side hall leading to the eastern entrance has a particularly fine carved arched niche for housing a tall clock. When John Parsons, a successful merchant, built the house in 1812, he copied his wife's house in Newburyport, Massachusetts. The house was sold to the Sewall family in 1815, and was bequeathed by Mrs. William Sewall to her nephew, Edward Bourne, Jr. in the late 19th century. The Bournes are a historically old family of Kennebunk, with a long line of civic and economically significant actors.

She is further described there as \\"One of those lofty, black, and lasting beauties that strike with reverence and yet delight\\". Catherine's personal qualities were praised by her contemporaries, Sir Richard Steele included, and her wit and urbanity were noted by Ballard who referred to her as having \\"great genius and good judgement\\", derived from her reading. Marriage In 1684 aged 15 she was married to 17-year-old William Boevey (1667‚Äì1692), who in the previous year 1683 had inherited Flaxley Abbey, Gloucestershire, from his first cousin Abraham II Clark (1622‚Äì1683)Dates per his monument at Flaxley Church who had died without surviving issue. William was the son of the merchant, lawyer and philosopher James Boevey (1622‚Äì1696) by his second wife Isabella de Visscher.

Friendship with Mary Pope By about 1686, aged 17, she had formed a strong friendship with Mrs. Mary Pope, daughter of John Pope, a Bristol merchant.Mary Pope's father named on Catherina's monument in Westminster Abbey Seeing ample scope for a life of active benefactions, Catherina associated Mrs. Pope with her in her philanthropic career. The modern era has ascribed a possible element of lesbianism into the close friendship between the two women. Philanthropic career Catherina Boevey distributed to the poor, relieved prisoners, and taught the children of her neighbours. Her gifts, which included the purchase and donation of an estate to augment the income of Flaxley Church, a legacy to Bermuda, and bequests to two schools at Westminster, are listed on her monument in Flaxley Church. Particulars of her habits, and of how she dispensed her charities, appear in H. G. Nicholls's Forest of Dean, pp. 185 et seq. Publicly esteemed In 1702 George Hickes, in the preface (p. xlvii) to Linguarum Septentrionalium Thesaurus, calls Mrs. Bovey \\"Angli√¶ nostr√¶ Hypatia Christiana.\\" In 1714, Steele prefixed an Epistle Dedicatory to her at the start of the second volume of the Ladies' Library. \\"Do not believe that I have many such as Portia to speak of,\\" wrote the author of The New Atlantis (p. 212); and the repute of her happy ways and generous deeds had not died out in 1807, when Fosbroke in his \\"History of Gloucestershire\\"Gloucestershire, p. 179 described her as \\"a very learned, most exemplary, and excellent woman\\". Death and burial She died at Flaxley Hall on Saturday, 18 January 1726, and was buried \\"in a most private manner\\", according to her own directions (Gent. Mag. lxii. pt. ii. 703). Monuments=PhysicalWestminster Abbey= A now lost monument was erected to Mrs. Bovey in Westminster Abbey, by her friend Mrs. Pope, shortly after her death and survived certainly as late as 1750. Ballard who called it \\"a beautiful honorary marble monument\\", wrote to a friend asking him to copy the inscription for him, telling him it was on the north side.Nichols, Lit. Illustr. iv. 223 It is transcribed in Ballard's Ladies and in John Wilford's Memorials. There is however no mention of the monument or of Mrs. Boevey either in Mackenzie Walcott's Memorials of Westminster, (1851), or in Arthur Penrhyn Stanley's Westminster Abbey, (1882, 5th edition).

He studied in a Tarbut High School and continued to the Teachers' College in Vilnius. In 1935, having received an Aliya certificate sponsored by his uncle, the poet Kadish-Yehuda Silman, Rehavam came to Eretz-Israel, then Palestine under the British Mandate. He arrived in Jerusalem and stayed with relatives in the neighborhood of Beit HaKerem. There he completed his studies in the local Teachers' College under the directorship of Ben-Zion Dinur. Upon graduating, Rehavam went to teach in Yavne'el (then a frontier settlement) in Galilee, where he met his wife, Avital Brandstatter. In 1939, he moved to Tel Aviv and taught at the Gretz Elementary School. Military career Amir joined the Hagannah in late 1936. He participated in one of the Hagannah's first wireless operators' courses that was conducted clandestinely in kibbutz Ayelet HaShahar in Upper Galilee. While teaching in Yavne'el, Amir served as the contact between Yavne'el and Hagannah headquarters. In 1941, Amir was requested to head a Hagannah communication course held in the Oriental Bazaar in Tel Aviv for members of the Moshe Dayan Network. Participants in the course were taught professional wireless operations by experts such as Peretz Rosenberg. Upon completion of the course, Amir was invited to the home of Eliyahu Golomb, head of the Haganah who told him about the possibility of being sent beyond enemy lines in Europe. He was asked whether he would be willing to go as a British soldier to reach the Jewish communities in occupied Europe. In the winter of 1941 he was sent to British HQ in Cairo where he established a school for wireless operators whose trainees were Yugoslav volunteers from Slovenia who had been captured by the British in the Western Desert. Amir's Hagannah commanders, Eliyahu Golomb and Reuven Zaslani (Shiloah), supported the venture. Thus Amir returned to Cairo in February 1942 to command the course and undergo further training. He completed a parachutist course conducted by the British \\"Inter-Services Liaison Department\\" (ISLD), a cover name for MI6. Over the following months there were various delays in carrying out the mission. Only in October 1943, about a month after his marriage to Avital, did his orders come through. Amir boarded a boat from Alexandria to Bari in Italy. Once there, he made contacts with other units from Eretz-Israel already stationed in Salerno. He transferred to them money from the Jewish Agency. Back in Bari in late December, he boarded a Motor Torpedo Boat (MTB) that took him to the isle of Vis in the Adriatic Sea. This was the only island in the Adriatic to be under the control of Tito's Partisans or Allied forces. There he joined another ISLD representative and they set up direct radio contact with HQ in Bari. During Amir's three-month stay on the island he made contact with various forces that passed through, amongst them other volunteers from Eretz-Israel, commandos, as well as a group of two hundred Jewish refugees from Yugoslavia who had been assisted by the Partisans to reach Vis. Amir told them about the soldiers from Eretz-Israel and the refugee camps that had been established in the liberated area in southern Italy. He assisted their transfer to Bari and to the camps. In the spring 1944, Amir returned to Bari in preparation for his original mission. He was promoted to Lieutenant. During the night of May 12/13, 1944, Lieut. Allan, as Amir was known by his code name, parachuted into the \\"Fourth Zone\\", an area south-east of Lubliana, Slovenia, under Partisan control, but surrounded by the Germans. Amir's official assignment was to find a lost British mission that had previously parachuted into the area, but had gone astray and had not been contacted. He was also assigned to improve the radio communications systems at the Partisans' headquarters and to further train them in communications and encoding. He was also instructed to establish independent wireless contact with the HQ in Bari and, unofficially to find fleeing Jews in order to help them escape to safety and freedom. Amir spent the summer months with the Partisans, marching from camp to camp. In September 1944 he left for Bari but returned to Slovenia with further technical equipment and supplies. At the end of 1944, having been three times behind enemy lines, Amir returned to Eretz-Israel. Looking back upon the tasks Rehavam Amir said: :We were all of a generation that had been educated to fulfill the missions that were thrust upon us. I do not remember one of our fellow emissaries who looked for publicity or craved a battle. Most of us were young regular guys ... each and every one of us regarded [the mission] as a great privilege and unhesitatingly answered ‚Äì Yes! Amir remained in the SHA\\"I (the Hagannah Intelligence Service), at first in Tel-Aviv and later in Haifa. While in Haifa he was also headmaster of the Reali elementary school. Upon the establishment of the State of Israel in May 1948, he was appointed Military Governor of Acre and the Western Galilee. Diplomatic career Rehavam Amir joined the senior ranks of the Foreign Ministry as head of Personnel/Administration. In that capacity he was responsible for the logistically complex operation of transferring the ministry from Tel-Aviv to Jerusalem in the summer of 1953. This was carried out in one night with everything - all offices and departments - functioning the following day. In August 1953, Amir was appointed Israel's Consul-General to the United Kingdom. Together with his wife Avital and daughters Shulamit and Dalia, the family moved to London for five years. In late 1958, Amir was appointed Head of Israel's Legation to Poland. It was during this period that evidence of the Holocaust was being uncovered and the sites of the extermination camps were as yet hardly known. Amir and his diplomatic staff were amongst the first Jewish visitors to the camps after World War II. At this time, Poland's PM W≈Çadys≈Çaw Gomu≈Çka enabled Jews to leave Poland. Having completed another three years tour of duty in Poland, Amir returned home to Israel and held several posts in the Foreign Ministry. In 1963, he transferred to the Prime Minister's Office upon his appointment as David Ben-Gurion's Advisor for Arab Affairs. Upon Ben- Gurion's resignation he continued to work with PM Levi Eshkol. In 1964, Amir coordinated the visit of Pope Paul VI to Megiddo and Nazareth. From 1965 to 1968 Amir served in the Jewish Agency as Director of Jewish Education in the Diaspora. In 1968 he returned to the Foreign Ministry and served as Israel's Consul-General in New York City until 1971. From 1971 to 1975 Amir served as Israel's Ambassador to Thailand. In December 1972, Amir's talents and competency were once again put to the test when the PLO's Black September attacked the Israeli embassy in Bangkok and took all the occupants as hostages. Rehavam and Avital were attending a ceremony at the Royal Palace thus they were not among the hostages and could therefore conduct the negotiations with the kidnappers. Following the intense negotiations, including the King of Thailand's personal insistence that no blood be shed, and with the rare and courageous cooperation of the Egyptian Ambassador, (at the time Israel had no relations with Egypt), the hostages were finally released without use of force or anyone being hurt. In 1975, returning to Israel once again, Amir was appointed Chief of Protocol responsible for official visits of foreign dignitaries: US President Jimmy Carter and Egypt's President Anwar Sadat's historic visit to Jerusalem in 1977. From 1979 to 1982 Amir served as Israel's Ambassador to Finland. Upon retirement from the Foreign Ministry, Amir continued to be active for many years, voluntarily advising Teddy Kollek, Mayor of Jerusalem, serving on the Board of the David Yellin Teachers' College, ERA\\"N and the Board of Governors of Ben-Gurion University of the Negev.

After the fall of Nicosia, the Turks laid siege to Famagusta, and Baglioni launched a series of successful raids against the besiegers. The Turks lost some 52,000 men in five major assaults until, in late July, the Venetians, despairing to receive any rescue from the homeland, decided to surrender.

It was an exception to the typical model for shoe factories in Maine, which were often built by public subscription and leased out to out-of-state firms. This factory was founded by David Cummings of Worcester, Massachusetts, partly in response to increasing labor organization in Massachusetts. In addition to the main factory building, the complex included a large number of ancillary buildings for related operations such as tanning; all of these have since been demolished. The Cummingses, a family operation, ran the factory until 1929, after which it was operated for a time on the more common leasing model. Its last industrial owner was foreclosed in 1993, and the town acquired the property in 1995. It now contains 48 housing units.

The main entrance is located near the center of the east-facing front facade, sheltered by a porch that extends to the southern corner on the first floor, and is topped by a smaller porch on the second floor. Both porches are supported by groups of turned columns, with latticework valances and turned balustrades. To the right of the entrance a window bay, squared on the first floor and polygonal on the second, projects slightly. The house was built in 1894 by Mary R.

It is located at the junction of Old and State Roads, in an architecturally distinguished building constructed in 1907 via a bequest from Dr. John S. H. Fogg in memory of his father William. The building was designed by C. Howard Walker, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on December 21, 1991. Architecture and history The Fogg Library is set at the northwest corner of Old and State Roads (Old Road being designated Maine State Route 103), near the northern end of Eliot's linear village center. It is a 1-1/2 story structure fashioned out of fieldstone, with a flared hip roof, set on a low hill on a triangular lot. Its distinctive exterior and elevated position adjacent to the main road make it a prominent local landmark. Its main facade is three bays wide, with a center entrance portico supported by four Ionic columns, with an entablature and fully pedimented gable above. The roof has three gabled dormers, and there are granite string courses above the foundation and below the windows. The interior has a central hall, with a reading room on one side and children's room on the other, and stacks located in an ell to the rear. The interior is relatively little altered since its construction. The first library established in the town Eliot was a private lending library established by William Fogg and housed at his home on Old Road. Fogg's son, Dr. John H. S. Fogg, a Harvard-educated doctor, continued his father's interest in education, amassing a collection of books. Upon his death he gave most of his book collection to the town, and bequested $10,000 to the town for construction of a library on land he donated. The new library was built in 1907, to a design by Boston architect C. Howard Walker, and supposedly used stone materials gathered from the walls lining the Fogg property. Fogg also established a trust fund for maintenance of the building.

SATB2 is a DNA-binding protein that specifically binds nuclear matrix attachment regions and is involved in transcriptional regulation and chromatin remodeling. SATB2 shows a restricted mode of expression and is expressed in certain cell nuclei . The SATB2 protein is mainly expressed in the epithelial cells of the colon and rectum, followed by the nuclei of neurons in the brain.  Function  With an average worldwide prevalence of 1/800 live births, oral clefts are one of the most common birth defects. Although over 300 malformation syndromes can include an oral cleft, non-syndromic forms represent about 70% of cases with cleft lip with or without cleft palate (CL/P) and roughly 50% of cases with cleft palate (CP) only. Non-syndromic oral clefts are considered ‚Äòcomplex‚Äô or ‚Äòmultifactorial‚Äô in that both genes and environmental factors contribute to the etiology. Current research suggests that several genes are likely to control risk, as well as environmental factors such as maternal smoking. Re-sequencing studies to identify specific mutations suggest several different genes may control risk to oral clefts, and many distinct variants or mutations in apparently causal genes have been found reflecting a high degree of allelic heterogeneity. Although most of these mutations are extremely rare and often show incomplete penetrance (i.e., an unaffected parent or other relative may also carry the mutation), combined they may account for up to 5% of non-syndromic oral cleft. Mutations in the SATB2 gene have been found to cause isolated cleft palates. SATB2 also likely influences brain development. This is consistent with mouse studies that show SATB2 is necessary for proper establishment of cortical neuron connections across the corpus callosum, despite the apparently normal corpus callosum in heterozygous knockout mice.  Structure  SATB2 is a 733 amino-acid homeodomain-containing human protein with a molecular weight of 82.5 kDa encoded by the SATB2 gene on 2q33. The protein contains two degenerate homeodomain regions known as CUT domains (amino acid 352‚Äì437 and 482‚Äì560) and a classical homeodomain (amino acid 614‚Äì677). There is an extraordinarily high degree of sequence conservation, with only three predicted amino-acid substitutions in the 733 residue protein with I481V, A590T and I730T being amino acid differences between the human and the mouse protein.  Clinical significance  SATB2 has been implicated as causative in the cleft or high palate of individuals with 2q32q33 microdeletion syndrome. SATB2 was found to be disrupted in two unrelated cases with de novo apparently balanced chromosome translocations associated with cleft palate and Pierre Robin sequence. The role of SATB2 in tooth and jaw development is supported by the identification of a de novo SATB2 mutation in a male with profound intellectual disabilities and jaw and tooth abnormalities and a translocation interrupting SATB2 in an individual with Robin sequence. In addition, mouse models have demonstrated haploinsufficiency of SATB2 results in craniofacial defects that phenocopy those caused by 2q32q33 deletion in humans; moreover, full functional loss of SATB2 amplifies these defects. SATB2 expression is highly specific for cancer in the lower GI-tract and has been implicated as a cancer biomarker for colorectal cancer.

Mills was born on November 4, 1819 in Canton, Connecticut, the son of Isaac and Asenath Merrill Mills. Although his parents preferred he take up a professional career, Mills found he had no taste for college life, and in 1833, he joined his father's gunpowder manufacturing firm. In 1838, he moved to Alabama to represent the firm there, but in 1840 his father's health began to fail and the younger Mills moved back to Canton and take the reins of the business. However, in 1845, Mills decided to start a new business in the west. Originally he intended to set up shop in Fort Wayne, Indiana, but the early closing of navigation in the fall forced him to lay over for some time in Detroit. Sensing an opportunity, Mills abandoned his original plan and opened a general store in Detroit. He also began trading in furs, and soon established a reputation as one of the best- known fur traders in the area. In 1850, he began manufacturing cigars, continuing and expanding the business, founding the Nevin & Mills company in 1861 and the Banner Tobacco Company in 1878. In 1867, Mills partnered with two other businessmen to open the Detroit Stove Works. In 1872 Jeremiah Dwyer started the Michigan Stove Company along with Mills and other businessmen. In addition, he was also connected with Detroit's First National Bank, Detroit Fire and Marine Insurance, Eldredge Sewing Machine Company of Chicago, and the Frankfort Furnace Company; and was president of the Transit Railway Company of Detroit. Politics Mills was a staunch Democrat, serving as chair of the Democratic State Committee in 1856 and 1857. He spent great effort and money equipping Michigan regiments during the Civil War. He was mayor of Detroit in 1866-1867, and in 1868 ran unsuccessfully for US Congress. He served on the Detroit Board of Estimates, and in 1876 was a delegate to the Democratic National Convention. Personal Mills married Cynthia A. Barbour. The couple had two children, Merrill B. Mills and Ella B. Mills. Health issues forced Mills's retirement from business and politics in 1880, and Mills died on September 14, 1882, survived by his wife and two children; his son Merrill B.

Early works of Infestum had elements of Pagan metal, but the band later changed its style to a black metal sound. Russian label More Hate Productions considers this band one of the most respectful bands from ex-USSR black metal scene.  Biography =Early years (2000-2003) Infestum was formed in June 2000 by Grond as drummer and Skald as guitarist. Afterwards, Ion joined Infestum on vocals and Thorngrim joined on bass. With this line-up, Infestum started to create their music. They also played the songs of bands such as Sepultura, Mayhem, Venom, and Bathory at their rehearsals. In the winter of 2000-2001, Infestum recorded their first demo, which was called \\"Infestum\\" and contained five songs. The song \\"Secha (Slashing)\\" begins with sounds like a battle, horses galloping, axes, screams, and a martial rhythm. As Ion said in the interview to \\"Eternal Hate\\" webzine, \\"Our history, battles of the past and battles in our minds are fundamental in our creation\\". Later in 2002, this record was released in an MCD format on the American label Battle Hymn Records. The demo release has received generally positive feedback in the press and has been compared with bands such as Bathory, Falkenbach, Gontyna Kry, Graveland, and Nordreich. In spring 2001, Infestum started to play concerts actively. But in October the same year, Grond got injured and was not able to play in the band anymore. He was replaced by Burglar, who played in Morbid Victory at that time. Burglar left Morbid Victory and became an Infestum member. He participated in recording a full-length CD which the band were going to call \\"Criteria of Pure Insanity\\", but later changed their mind. This title was given to the first song of the album. In winter 2000-2001, Infestum recorded a full-length album, which was called \\"Last Day Before the Endless Night\\". It had four re-recorded songs from the demo album, alongside newly introduced songs. During the end of 2002, the album was released by the Russian label More Hate Productions. Cover artwork and design was handled by Valdmar Smerdulak, an artist who has worked with such groups as Nanghizidda and Massive Carnage. Black metal was attenuated with instrumental compositions, which emphasized folklorish style of Infestum. But new lyrics was almost devoid of folk motives.  \\"Ta Natas\\" (2003-2007)  In 2003 Infestum starts work on a new album \\"Ta Natas\\". As Ion said it should have been \\"more dense and tough music in all senses than previous works\\", and Skald described this album as a \\"total bedlam\\". Album material was changed very long time unless it was released in 2007 by German label Blood Fire Death Productions. It has been dedicated to the memory of Alyona Zimnitskaya (16.10.1981 ‚Äî 19.09.2006). This album was void of folk elements and gained new expressive vanguard forms. Black metal was complemented witch symphonic elements and synthesizer play. The album also featured artwork by Valdmar Smerdulak who had a great experience in creating that kind of stuff for bands at that time. With changing the style of music the band changes its appearance also. They don't wear chain armour anymore at their concerts but prefer more severe style of wearing. Two music videos were filmed at that period: \\"Razor To Throat\\" and \\"Ta Natas\\". Bass player Thorngrim was engaged in creating music videos. \\"Razor To Throat\\" was very popular on metalvideo.com portal and ranked in top 10 of the portal chart. A young girl took credit in this video. Her name was Nokturna. She acted naked in that video. \\"Ta Natas\\" has frames with a lot of human skulls. That frames were taken from the documentary about Sedlec Ossuary (a place of interests in Czech Republic). \\"Ta Natas\\" was met by critics in different ways but most of reviews were positive or neutral. A lot of metal web-sites assessed \\"Ta Natas\\" with marks above medium. \\"This album is full of anger, pain and despair\\", one of the critics said. Another critic said: \\"the band manages to combine darkness, despair and melody and I think that that is worth a compliment, as not many bands succeed in that!\\". Some critics found that the lack of this album was too over-processed, forced and screamed vocals. At the same time when album was released Divine Skald left the band. A new guitarist that replaced him was A\\\\Vesh (–ù–∞—à–∞ –í–∞–π–Ω–∞, –ü—è—Ä—ç–≤–∞—Ä–∞—Ü–µ–Ω—å). Later years (2007 - present) In 2009 A\\\\Vesh and Burglar left the band. Guitarist Wrathtodd (ID:vision), a friend of the band, joined Infestum afterwards.

State of Georgia, 64 U.S. (23 How.) 505 (1860), is a 9-to-0 ruling by the Supreme Court of the United States which held that the true border between the states of Alabama and Georgia was the average water mark on the western bank of the Chattahoochee River. In coming to its conclusion, the Court defined what constituted the bed and bank of a river.Wisdom, The Law of Rivers and Watercourses, 1962, p. 9.Kalinoe, Water Law and Customary Water Rights in Papua New Guinea, 1999, p. 27-28. The case has had international repercussions as well. The Supreme Court's definition was adopted by courts in the United Kingdom in the case Hindson v. Ashby (1896) 65 LJ Ch. 515, 2 Ch. 27. Background In 1629, during European colonization of the Americas, Charles I of England granted Sir Robert Heath a charter giving him title to Native American-occupied land from the northern boundary of what is modern-day Florida north to Albemarle Sound (31st latitude), extending from the Atlantic Ocean west to the Pacific Ocean.Chiorazzi and Most, Prestatehood Legal Materials: A Fifty-State Research Guide, Including New York City and the District of Columbia, 2006, p. 840. In 1663, Charles II of England revoked the Heath charter and issued a new charter to eight noblemen (the \\"Lords and Proprietors\\"). In 1665, this charter was amended to extend the land grant northward roughly to the current border of North Carolina and Virginia.Chiorazzi and Most, Prestatehood Legal Materials: A Fifty-State Research Guide, Including New York City and the District of Columbia, 2006, p. 840-841. In 1729, the Proprietors were forced to turn their charters over to George II of Great Britain, and North Carolina separated from South Carolina.Chiorazzi and Most, Prestatehood Legal Materials: A Fifty-State Research Guide, Including New York City and the District of Columbia, 2006, p. 841. In 1732, George II granted James Oglethorpe and other settlers a charter to all South Carolina Colony land west of the Savannah River.Channing, A Students' History of the United States, 1898, p. 128-129. However, the charter was unclear as to whether the new colony covered all of South Carolina's western border, and South Carolina continued to dispute Georgia's claim over a strip of land about wide.Lalor, \\"Territorries,\\" in Cyclop√¶dia of Political Science, Political Economy, and of the Political History of the United States, 1886, p. 915. In order to help secure ratification of the Articles of Confederation, the new United States Congress passed legislation encouraging all states to give up their western claims so that new territories might be formed and transformed into states which might eventually be admitted to the union.Lalor, \\"Territorries,\\" in Cyclop√¶dia of Political Science, Political Economy, and of the Political History of the United States, 1886, p. 916-917. In August 1787, South Carolina ceded the disputed strip of land to the state of Georgia.Lalor, \\"Territorries,\\" in Cyclop√¶dia of Political Science, Political Economy, and of the Political History of the United States, 1886, p. 917. In the Compact of 1802, Georgia ceded its sparsely settled western lands beyond the Chattahoochee River to the United States in exchange for a guarantee that the federal government would extinguish all Native American claims to land within the state's borders.Lalor, \\"Territorries,\\" in Cyclop√¶dia of Political Science, Political Economy, and of the Political History of the United States, 1886, p. 391.Sturgis, Presidents From Washington Through Monroe: 1789‚Äì1825: Debating the Issues in Pro and Con Primary Documents, 2002, p. 109. The United States made good on its promise, removing the Cherokee nation to reservations in the new Mississippi Territory (a process which would not end until the completion of the Trail of Tears forcible removals in 1838). The Compact of 1802 specified that Georgia's western boundary would be as follows:State of Alabama v. State of Georgia, 64 U.S. 505. In 1817, what is now the modern state of Mississippi was created from the western half of the Mississippi Territory, the remaining territory renamed the Alabama Territory.Chiorazzi and Most, Prestatehood Legal Materials: A Fifty-State Research Guide, Including New York City and the District of Columbia, 2006, p. 9. The territory became the modern state of Alabama in 1819.Chiorazzi and Most, Prestatehood Legal Materials: A Fifty-State Research Guide, Including New York City and the District of Columbia, 2006, p. 14-16. The state of Alabama entered into a dispute with the state of Georgia over the specific meaning of the Compact of 1802. Alabama argued that the contour of the land on the western bank of the Chattahoochee River was sometimes high bluffs and sometimes low, flat floodplains, and that the high-water mark sometimes marched as much as a half-mile inland to the west.State of Alabama v. State of Georgia, 64 U.S. 505, 506‚Äì507. Georgia answered that it did indeed claim these lands as its own, and that the Compact of 1802 did not cover the northernmost part of the border (which Georgia claimed it had obtained directly from the state of South Carolina in 1787 without first transferring title to the United States).State of Alabama v. State of Georgia, 64 U.S. 505, 509‚Äì510. The State of Alabama submitted its case to the Supreme Court in December 1855.State of Alabama v. State of Georgia, 64 U.S. 505, 506. The State of Georgia submitted its reply in December 1858.State of Alabama v. State of Georgia, 64 U.S. 505, 508. Decision Associate Justice James Moore Wayne delivered the unanimous opinion of the court. Justice Wayne emphasized the mutual nature of the Compact of 1802, and pointed out that Georgia admitted in the agreement that its western boundary extended north to the border with the state of Tennessee.State of Alabama v. State of Georgia, 64 U. S. 505, 511. This, then, made any argument over the South Carolina cession of 1787 moot. Next, Justice Wayne argued that \\"The contract of cession must be interpreted by the words of it, according to their received meaning and use in the language in which it is written, as that can be collected from judicial opinions concerning the rights of private persons upon rivers, and the writings of publicists in reference to the settlement of controversies between nations and States as to their ownership and jurisdiction on the soil of rivers within their banks and beds.\\"State of Alabama v. State of Georgia, 64 U. S. 505, 512‚Äì513. Citing scholarly sources from Europe, American case law (such as Handly's Lessee v. Anthony, 18 U. S. 374 (1820)), and other cessions between states and the United States, Justice Wayne concluded that the Compact of 1802 did not mean the low-water mark as claimed by Alabama.State of Alabama v. State of Georgia, 64 U. S. 505, 514‚Äì515. However, Wayne concluded that this did not necessarily mean the high-water mark, as claimed by Georgia. Rather, the Compact of 1802 specified the western bank, and the bank was different from the high-water mark. Drawing on the sources cited, Wayne defined the bank as follows (emphasis in original):State of Alabama v. State of Georgia, 64 U. S. 505, 515. The majority concluded, therefore, that only the average water level defined the bank, and that the boundary of Georgia should be so marked. The Court also reaffirmed that the Compact of 1802 gave both states free navigation of the river. ReferencesBibliography *Channing, Edward. A Students' History of the United States.

(2010) 'Project Sponsorship: An Essential Guide for Those Sponsoring Projects Within Their Organizations', Gower Publishing, Farnham, There are two main differences between project sponsorship and project management. Firstly project sponsorship includes the identification and definition of the project whereas project management is concerned with delivering a project that is already defined, if only quite loosely. Secondly the project sponsor is responsible for the project‚Äôs business case and should not hesitate to recommend cancellation of the project if the business case no longer justifies the project. Project sponsors can encourage separation of decision making responsibilities between project manager and project sponsor, accountability for the realisation of project benefits, oversight of the project management function and can carry out senior stakeholder management.Sponsoring change - A guide to the governance aspects of project sponsorship, Association for Project Management, 2009. Skills The project sponsor or executive sponsor needs a range of skill sets, or at least access to skill sets which include appreciation of corporate strategy; ability to prepare a business case and profound knowledge of the organization‚Äôs operations. The project sponsor also needs to know his or her way around the organization and command respect within it. The project sponsor and project manager should form an effective partnership with the project manager orchestrating all players involved in delivering the project e.g. designers, manufacturers and contractors, whilst the project sponsor coordinates all departments of the client organization and associated stakeholders so as to integrate the delivered project into the client organization and take full benefits from it such that the business case is fulfilled.

He further notes that Lil B draws from a large variety of genres, especially those not commonly used by other rappers. In an interview with Staley, Lil B agrees with this analysis, saying, \\"I can do 'Swag OD' but then my favorite musical artist right now could be Antony and the Johnsons.

In this, he raps, \\"They say hard work pays off / Well, tell the BasedGod don't quit his day job.\\" Lil B responded with a song titled \\"I'm The Bada$$\\". Joey Bada$$ then responded with a song titled \\"Don't Quit Your Day Job!\\". When the feud became public on Twitter, Joey became a target of a lot of attacks from Lil B's fans, which ended up with Joey deleting his Twitter account, though restoring it later. In an interview with WWPR-FM, Joey Badass denied that he deleted his Twitter account because of Lil B's fans. Later, in an interview with VladTV, Joey admitted the feud was created for publicity, and admitted he's a fan of Lil B's more serious work.  Kevin Durant  In 2011, NBA superstar Kevin Durant tweeted his befuddlement with Lil B's popularity, and Lil B responded by \\"cursing\\" Durant that he would never win the NBA championship. The curse had been rescinded in 2012 but then reinstated in 2014. The feud between the two has simmered since then, resulting in Lil B releasing the diss track \\"Fuck KD\\" in 2014 and also a commercial on NBA TV where Lil B calls out Kevin Durant. Lil B has claimed the \\"curse of the Based God\\" to be responsible for Durant and his Oklahoma City Thunder team's loss to the Golden State Warriors in the Western Conference Finals of the 2016 NBA Playoffs. The Thunder had been up 3 games to 1 in a best-of-7 series, but then went on to lose the series in stunning fashion after losing the next 3 games in a row. On July 4, 2016, following the announcement of Durant leaving the Thunder for the Golden State Warriors, Lil B rescinded the curse again.  James Harden  During the Western Conference Finals of the 2015 NBA Playoffs, Lil B began questioning NBA superstar James Harden's \\"cooking dance\\", a dance allegedly coined by Lil B which he had been doing all season long, and tweeted that if he doesn't receive an answer from Harden regarding that dance then Harden will receive the \\"Based God curse\\" similar to Kevin Durant. Lil B attributed the Houston Rockets loss to the Golden State Warriors with the score of 99‚Äì98 in Game 2, and again in Game 3 with the score of 115‚Äì80, to the curse. On May 24, 2015, Lil B announced on TMZ Sports that he has placed Harden under the \\"Based God curse\\" for the remainder of the playoffs and until further notice. On May 27, 2015, Lil B was present at Oracle Arena for Game 5 where the Warriors ultimately defeated the Rockets with the score of 104‚Äì90, becoming the Western Conference champions. Additionally, during this same game Harden set an NBA Playoff record with 13 turnovers, prompting Lil B to publicly consider lifting the curse. On June 4, 2017, Lil B announced on a live taping of First Take that he has lifted the curse from Harden.

It is one of the few green areas located north of the Mexico City suburbs. 95% of its territory is located in Gustavo A. Madero, D.F. Borough and 5% in the municipality of Tlalnepantla de Baz. This is one of the large expanses of artificial forest of eucalyptus and was reforested in the first half of the 20th century in the Federal District. The designated territory for the National Park is the Tepeyac Hill, place known for the legend of the apparition of the Virgin of Guadalupe to the indigenous Juan Diego. From the top of the hill a whole view of the Valley of Mexico can be seen. However, this place is threatened by the urban sprawl growing in the surroundings. This park covers part of the Sierra de Guadalupe mountain range and was created through a decree issued on February 18, 1937. Originally it had an extension of 1,500 ha. Even though several other authors indicate different current numbers depending on the type of topographic study applied. 56% of the park is legally an \\"ejido\\" and the 44% left is privately owned. Because once the territory had a completely lack of vegetation and was restored after reforestation activities, by decrees issued in 1926, 1937 and 1972, El Tepeyac is now considered a protected National Park under reforestation programs of Local and Federal administration. Geography and nature The park includes within its territory the Tepeyac Hill, Cerro de Guerrero and the Cerro de Santa Isabel. The territory is shared in the middle by 6 colonias of the Gustavo A. Madero borough that surround it. Their population rises to 33,263 hab. Another 87,604 people live in the surrounding neighborhoods of the same borough. The main access of the park is still located in Mexico City on Insurgentes avenue, after the town of Santa Isabel Tola. The park is located at the Eastern Sierra de Guadalupe with a low altitude. There are three main elevated areas that are between 2,450 and 2,500 meters above sea level. These elevations are composed mainly of volcanic soil. They are geologically composed of igneous hypabyssal rocks, tuffs and basaltic andesite. The soil of the Park is constituted mainly by eutric regosols (soils on the convergent toe slope, having typical horizontal arrangements), all of them fertile and easily erodible with low retention of moisture. Some areas of the Park are constituted by lithosols and faeozems haplic. It does not have any nearby tributary. Above Lake Texcoco and Lake Zumpango lined hills part. The Aqueduct of Guadalupe, which produced water for the nearby Villa Guadalupe and came with the vital fluid to Tlalnepantla village, was built due to the lack of liquid for human consumption. In general the climate zone is temperate semi-dry type with rains that occur during the summer. There are only temporary torrential runoffs during the wet season and some over-pumping emanations forming small wells of volcanic rock in the Park. Flora and fauna The predominant species is eucalyptus, which was planted to reforest this Park and other areas around the Valley of Mexico, thereby creating large tracts of protected forest. Although you it can also be observed some of the following species to a lesser extent: Cedar, oak, radiata pine, pine patula pirules. In some smaller areas there is presence of grasslands. The fauna of the place is gone, there are just some kind of rats, mouses and some species introduced by people that live or work close to the Park. Cultural aspects Since the pre-Hispanic period the reference zone is a ceremonial center of great importance to the Aztec culture in the worship of the goddess Tonatzin and since the Hispanic period in the veneration of the Virgin of Guadalupe. The etymology is Nahuatl, and Zacahuitzco Zacatenco means place of grass and thorns; Vicente Guerrero, also called Atzacualt√©petl: on the Hill; door Gachupines, known as Quezahuatitlan: sterile tree. Early settlers pre-Hispanic the area settled on the slopes of the mountain range of Guadalupe sites today known as Ticoman, Tlatilco and Zacatenco, outside of these sites not found vestiges that indicate the presence of other people, due perhaps to the waters of the Lake reached the slopes of the hills of Tepeyac and Guerrero. A series of excavations in this region on the North of the Mexico City, found human remains in adjoining buildings inhabited; tombs finding also ceramic, clay, stone and obsidian tools figurines objects ornament; simple shapes and with clear Olmec influence. It is not known with precision when started this classic horizon, but it is estimated that it was at the beginning of the Christian era and ends in the ninth century. During this period, Mexico‚Äôs Valley is influenced by many cultures, among which are evident with greater significance: the Olmec the Teotihuacana, the Cholulteca, the Toltec, Chichimeca; latter being which predominated in the Serran√≠a de Guadalupe. Services Among others, El Tepeyac lodges administrative offices, an open refuge, sanitary services, a small chapel on top of the Gachupines Hill, a concreted road of 1.3 km, a small pond, storeroom, benches and tables, an out of service greenhouse and a children playground. Recreational activities Most visitors like going to the park in the mornings to take a walk. Camping is also popular during weekends. There is also a kids playground as part of the facilities of the park as well as soccer courts so that visitants can enjoy a soccer match. Picnics are also a common activity that the local population tend to perform inside the park. Problems The park has several security issues. There is vandalism occurring and constant attacks to visitors due to the lack of surveillance in the park. In consequence, only about 70 people attend the park on Sundays. There is also a high level of contamination due to waste accumulation and forest fires. The fires have made it a giant dump for the inhabitants from the nearby colonies. National Park Tepeyac, has served in recent years as a dump of gravel for underground works. There is currently a government authorization to deposit 60,000 cubic meters of trash in the park. The director of the Mexican Institute of Renewable Natural Resources, Enrique Beltran, stated that the waste deposited in \\"Parque del Tepeyac\\" constitutes a source of infection for inhabitants of the nearby area. The infections are originated because of the precipitations that have caused black waters to disseminate and contaminate neighbor colonies. There are other sources of pollution like solid waste (garbage) in different areas of the park. The green area suffers from removal and destruction of natural resources such as the collection of snails, insects, bird hunting, quarrying, fodder, roots and damage to its vegetation due to excessive logging and lack of flora and fauna care. As consequence of the lack of security and service employees, the park faces continuous uncontrolled access of visitors as well as lack of appropriate signing to indicate directions both externally and within the park area. The facilities are insufficient and in devastating conditions. Theoretically the park should have 1.500 hectares, but in reality there are only 650 because there are about six thousand illegally sold houses in the 850 hectares left. This Park serves as a natural barrier to erosion and also helps Mexico City with oxygen and weather stability. Bas√≠lica de Santa Mar√≠a de Guadalupe Parque Nacional El Tepeyac shares part of the hills of Santa Isabel and Guerrero with the Basilica of Guadalupe. El Tepeyac is famous for being, according to the Catholic faith, the site where the Virgin of Guadalupe appeared to Juan Diego Cuauhtlatoatzin the first Latin American indigenous who witnessed the apparition of the Virgin of Guadalupe in 1531. Currently at the foot of the hills of Santa Isabel and Guerrero is the Basilica of Guadalupe (the monumental complex dedicated to Virgin Guadalupe), which every year receives millions of pilgrims, especially on December 12. It is considered the main American Catholic religious meeting point and one of the most visited in the world with annually twenty million visitors.http://www.cronica.com.mx/nota.php?id_nota=403323http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/notas/537260.html The Basilica of Guadalupe is formed by a compound called Plaza Mariana composed of several churches and buildings. Forming the Basilica there are several chapels such as Capilla el Pocito, Parroquia de Capuchinas, Capilla del Cerrito and Capilla de Indios. It also has among their facilities an investigation center which includes an historical collection of Colonial Mexico documents mainly divided into three branches: Claveria, Parroquia and Secretaria Privada. It also holds music files with over 131 Mexican authors, 77 Italians, 23 Spanish and from other nationalities. Lorenzo Boturinis‚Äô Theological Library is also inside the facilities and it includes more than 17 000 titles. Another important part of the compound is the museum that opened in 1941 and holds an important art collection of 1500 Colonial Mexico pieces including paintings, sculptures, jewellery and more. It also has works from the most important painters of New Spain such as Cristobal de Villalpando and Miguel Cabrera. The halls are dedicated to the Virgin of Guadalupe and serve as temporary exhibition spaces.

Kotemon proceeds to take them to a neutral location where his friend Bearmon brought Koji and Zoe after they ended up in his village. After the two sides argue what they learned, Bearmon and Kotemon lead them to a mural of Ornismon with Bokomon deeming the DigiCode to be incomplete. Their peaceful meeting is broken up as Kotemon and Bearmon's older brothers, Dinohyumon and Grizzlymon, appear and battle each other. But after Takuya and Koji spirit evolve to Agunimon and KendoGarurumon to stop them, the respective brothers walk away. As the human Digimon prepare for battle when their leader d'Arcmon rallies the crowd, Takuya reluctantly accepts Dinohyumon's recruitment offer to allow Tommy to escape with Kotemon.

Furthermore, after the group notices a missing piece in the mural that is identical to the ornament both d'Arcmon and Hippogriffomon possess, J.P. and Zoe proceed to inform Takuya and Koji while the others stay behind in hope that they can find an answer to the crisis. On the battlefield, Takuya and Koji eventually spirit evolve to BurningGreymon and Lobomon to stop the war, but end up getting both sides to turn on them before Kazemon and Beetlemon arrive.

Kotemon gives his life to protect them, and Bearmon's tears along with Kotemon's sacrifice summons spectral forms of the Ancient Warriors.

Creating a smaller, new Digital World via Project Ark, Yggdrasil learns a small group of Digimon have gained a vaccine called the X-Antibody, that makes them immune to the X-Program, and upgrades them with new abilities and appearances. Yggdrasil dispatches its guards, the Royal Knights, to exterminate the X-Digimon. The Royal Knights consists of the merciless, loyal Omnimon, his best friend Gallantmon who questions Yggdrasil's motives, and the quiet Magnamon. Dorumon, a dragon-like Digimon and X-Antibody carrier, does not understand the prejudice from other Digimon. He is targeted by a Leomon for his X-Antibody, but Leomon is struck by lightning and dies, asking Dorumon to live for him. Omnimon is summoned to a meeting between regular Digimon and X-Digimon, but he exterminates all of them save WarGreymon X and a Tokomon. The two crashland near a temple where Dorumon lives, WarGreymon X leaving Tokomon in Dorumon's care whilst he lures Omnimon away. Dorumon witnesses Omnimon exterminate a herd of Digimon who oppose Yggdrasil's will before being targeted himself. WarGreymon X and MetalGarurumon X arrive, but the latter is killed, though not before giving his X-Antibody to a wounded Tokomon. Dorumon digivolves into his Champion-level Dorugamon, but Gallantmon arrives, revealing to Omnimon that Project Ark's second phase involves wiping out all Digimon, something which he refuses to participate in. Omnimon and Gallantmon duel, but Gallantmon allows himself to be killed so he can discern the truth, leaving Omnimon confused. Magnamon capture Dorugamon on Yggdrasil's command, revealing Dorumon is an experiment. Data is extracted from Dorugamon, used to create an army of DexDoruGreymon while Dorugamon is dumped in a wrecking yard where he is found by resistance members Mummymon and Wizardmon. Yggdrasil's horde attacks the group's base, but WarGreymon X and a revived MetalGarurumon X help protect it. Dorugamon awakens, digivolving into DoruGreymon, resembling the attacking horde. Gallantmon returns as an X-Digimon, opening a portal for DoruGreymon to confront Yggdrasil. DoruGreymon confronts Magnamon and a disillusioned Omnimon. DoruGreymon digivolves into his Mega-level Alphamon, a legendary missing Royal Knight. Alphamon and Omnimon join forces to face Yggdrasil, but the loyal Magnamon warns his master of their arrival. In Yggdrasil's core, the Knights get nowhere with answers, and have to battle Alphamon's counterpart Dexmon. Alphamon impales himself and Dexmon using his own sword, and gives his X-Antibody to Omnimon, who successfully slays Yggdrasil. In the rebooted Digital World, Omnimon and Gallantmon muse over Yggdrasil's choices, concluding it merely wanted to live in the Digital World but it was too complex for it. Alphamon survives as Dorumon, reuniting with Tokomon.

Synopsis The United States has 250,000 soldiers stationed on more than 700 military bases in at least 40 countries across the globe. This deployment has continued to increase. The film explores historical displacement of native populations, including Italy, on Diego Garcia (an Indian Ocean island) and the Middle East. The film posits that while the traditional definition of the term empire means possession of colonies, the foundation of an \\"American empire\\" is based on a worldwide network of military bases. While they used to serve as simple supply facilities in war-like conflicts, they are often formed in the aftermath of armed US interventions, raising the question if this is an intentional strategy. The film presents various data and concludes with Chalmers Johnson, former CIA advisor, who claims this is a new type of imperialism containing a self-destructive recoil force that will lead to a medium-term decline and the ruin of the American position of power in the world.

Some of the techniques bring the managers the advantage to find opportunity areas in the company to correct them without affecting the enterprise development. This methods can be applied without big costs in money, time and training. This method can be applied to almost any enterprise.  Frederick Taylor Frederick Winslow Taylor is considered the father of scientific management. Taylor evolved from a simple floor worker to be the boss in a former company. He considered that the management techniques would determine the best way to divide the tasks inside an enterprise. The methods developed by Taylor began with experiments counting the time it takes for a machine to produce an object. He thought that this method could be applied to every worker in the enterprise. This method came when the economy and the efficiency of the enterprise was below the standards.  Taylor's steps of management Taylor established four principles to increase efficiency at the workplace. Although these principles were established a long time ago they are still used to resolve efficiency problems. The First principle is to analyze the way in which every worker does the task given. With all the information united, build a new improved plan of activities. This principle is based in the study of time-cost and time of delivery. The second principle consists in making a new method and give it as a written rule to be a standard for working. If the method is written down and given to the workers they can learn it and apply it in their work area. The third principle is that according to needs, chose the best workers that have the abilities and that can be trained to follow the standard rules. When a worker has the knowledge he can do his tasks better and achieve the goals asked. Fourth principle is to create a common goal between the workers and make a pay system to reward the ones above the common goal. With this principle the employees would work with more efficiency and do it with auto satisfaction. From these principles we deduce that every place in the enterprise costs money, so it is necessary to complete the labor analysis technique. Although the Frederick Taylor's original technique is still used, other methods' variations have been developed from it. These methods are also effective. Each one has a different process, but the main goal is to get the objectives. By knowing the different types of methods, people can use it as a strategic plan that will give an extra value against the competition. Derivatives of Taylor's original method=Labor Analysis The labor analysis came from the prior techniques of Frederick Taylor. The main difference is that this technique is focus on how a job position is developed in order to work with precise instructions. This diagnostic implies the actions to direct and correct the enterprise that is guided. As managers, they should identify and understand their workers to improve their abilities inside the enterprise. For a better knowledge of the problem the worker should know the main reason of his position and how to develop it in the company. The manager should establish each role of the company. In this way the relationship between the workers is promoted. The elements of the labor analysis are: First is the definition of position. In this step is named the actual position where is located in the enterprise. Who are the immediate bosses? Is another boss in the area? Are there any external people working? Second step is the general description that consists in five words describe the work done in the position. Third step is specific description. In this part the obligations and their daily activities are described. Sometimes the eventual and periodical activities need to be specified. The fourth step are objectives. The main objectives need to be quantified. An objective should follow the next conditions: An infinitive verb plus a percentage of main goals, with a specific date and the operations costs. Harvard Method and the Harvard Case Method This method was developed by the Harvard Business School were is used in the Management Business Academy course based on the Frederick Taylor principles. The case presented is longer than the MIT method, but also presents the important facts of the problem like the Short Facts Method that is more simple. It is considered a classic method because it is the most used by enterprises. The enterprises use this method by creating their own case with the information of their company so every employee can understand the problems that the company has so everyone can help to find the solutions. That is why enterprises need to create the conditions needed for automotivation in order to have better results from their employees. The Harvard Business School students use this case in order to understand the problems that they can find outside the school in their real job, so they read and analyze different cases to be prepared in the business world. Each student need to take the initiative to search for more information that can be helpful to do the analysis. It has been proven that this method help the students to learn with automotivation. The Harvard Case Method consist in four steps in which is apply the information the case present. The first step is fact analysis where the employees and managers that are analyzing the case writes the facts presented on the case without opinions. The second step is problem diagostic in which is described the problems that are presented on the case starting with the most important to solve. The third step is analysis of possible solutions where the possibility of each solution is seen as the way that can if it really can help to solve the problem. Finally, the fourth step consists in choosing one of the options presented on the step three that best solves the case. This method promote the search of answers inside the person not on the external facts. The main reason is that there is no solution or correct answers so there is an opportunity to learn from others. With the exposure of possible solutions in group you can learn with and from all the group, that is why it is effective, because the social learning effect. Short Facts Method This method is mostly applied by managers and supervisors based on Frederick Taylor method. The short facts method begins with a case no longer than four paragraphs in which a simple problem is described. Later on, the case is analyzed by the group of employees and managers of the enterprise. Then after finding the main facts, the group starts a discussion to find the possible solutions. At the end with a brainstorm they choose the best solution that can be apply to their own company. The main reason to use this method is because with the case based on the company all the employees and managers can have more ideas to find a solution to the problem that is reflected on the case and the employees can learn more about how to change their own company. MIT Method The MIT method is influenced by the Harvard Method but improved for the engineers to apply it in the enterprise is also another option for engineers to diagnose their enterprise without needing a business advisor. The engineers who might be on the group need an individual reading and research about the case given after the group session. Also for the session, they need to already do an analysis and a possible solution to compare it with the group. On each session the engineers will be guided by an instructor. All the engineers ask questions to the instructor to have more information about the case solution. At the end before the session is over the instructor tell the group what solution was near the correct answer and finally he gives the correct solution. In some cases the group decides what is the best solution according to all the proposals given in the session. Even though this method need more preparation, it is a good opportunity to improve the engineers' individual abilities. System Analysis Method The strategic analysis method is based on the elements or subsystems. This technique is based on prior methods of Frederick Taylor. These subsystems are related to the entire enterprise plan, so if one is changed in modification all the enterprise. This method is divided in four steps. First step is the mission determination in which the managers decide what they want as an enterprise, to be accomplished, what is the main purpose of the company. In this step is also include the principles that will guide the enterprise. The second step is environmental assessment. It is divided in external, determining threats and opportunities, and internal, determining strengths and weaknesses. The third step is objective setting where you create specific goals to the enterprise that can be measurable, achievable, time specific and documented. Finally the fourth step is strategy setting is when the managers create a strategy plan based on the steps before that creates the balance in the company. International implementations The above methods are primarily used in the United States. However, these methods are also applied in other countries such as Mexico and India. These countries were chosen because they are good examples of developed countries with high expectations in the future. In the case of M√©xico, there can be found more influences of the United States because they use the Harvard Case Method. What it is really interesting is that even though they applied the same method the improving impact is bigger in M√©xico than in the United States. While in India being the youngest country in the world brings a good opportunity to understand their business and how to enter from other parts of the world. Mexico For Mexico, the method used to diagnostic an enterprise is the case method. This method allows each person in the group to give ideas and possible solutions to the problem established. In Mexico people tend to be afraid of business and they need everyone‚Äôs opinion before they feel secure and close a business. But each participant gives his conclusions according to the knowledge he has and the experiences. In this method teamwork is very important. Everyone should collaborate in the conclusion and bring new ideas, even if they are out of this world. For PYMES, the government has created a web page in which the owners can search for useful information about small businesses. India India is a developing country has been growing in the business part. India exports increased from $13,586 million US dollars in August 2009, to $16,644 million US dollars in August 2010. Small and medium enterprises (SME) had become one of the strongest points in the economy. The SME is an alternative for the entrepreneur people that have the management abilities and an entrepreneur vision. People following these ideas are creating small enterprises that satisfy a necessity between the consumers and that they are capable of filling. When this enterprises have problems they could use the same method showed here to diagnose the problem and solve it. By using cases and using the management skills we could develop more skills for helping enterprises. For example, in India, two graduate students began their SME with an IT program in 1998. They started as consultants and then developed their IT enterprise as a web product company. Their strategy was to build a global internet business that could allow people to buy services rather than physical products. By this time the internet was not as common as it is right not. It was monopolized by BSNL, but they were not stopped by the government because soon after it broke down. Without any assessment or business diagnostic enterprise method they would not continue in the market.

He also worked as a miller and built the city's Grand Union and Congress Hotels. The Gideon Putnam Hotel in the Saratoga Spa State Park is named after Putnam. Putnam was a nephew of revolutionary war generals Rufus Putnam and Israel Putnam. Early life Putnam was born to Mary (n√©e Gibbs) and Stephen Putnam in 1763 in Sutton, Massachusetts. He was one of twelve children. In 1787, when Putnam was 19 years old, Putnam married 16-year-old Doanda Risley of Hartford, Connecticut. They went on to have five sons and four daughters. Their son Lewis was the \\"first white child born in Saratoga\\". The couple traveled to Middlebury, Vermont, where Putnam attempted to make a living as a miller. The settlement is now within the grounds of Middlebury College. Since the nearest gristmill was away with thick woods in between, he devised a method to grind grain on his own, \\"[cutting] out the top of [a] stump, and with a wooden pestle fitted to the excavation [grinding] their grain\\". Finding these circumstances undesirable, the Putnams moved to Rutland, Vermont, where their first son Benjamin was born. In 1788 the Putnams traveled to Bemis Heights, New York, with Doanda's sister and brother-in-law, Anne (n√©e Risley) and Dr. Clement Blakesley, respectively. Putnam found the land and wood in Bemis Heights to be especially agreeable, so he resolved to stay, constructing a loghouse for shelter. However, in spring of that year, torrential rains swept into the area, and the families were marooned by floods. A neighbor, Zophar Scidmore, came to their rescue in a sailboat. After staying in Scidmore's home for several days, the families departed, following an Indian trail to Saratoga Springs. Saratoga Springs In spring 1789, the Putnams settled in western Saratoga Springs, where 25-year-old Putnam constructed a log cabin adjacent to a freshwater spring. In reflection of his new life, Putnam said, \\"This is a healthy place; the mineral springs are valuable, and the timber is good and in great abundance, and I can build me a great house\\". Sawmill In 1791, Putnam rented 300 acres of land from Dirck Lefferts and opened a sawmill on Fish Creek, which flows from Saratoga Lake to the Hudson River. With the help of wheelwright William Patching, Putnam's sawmill produced staves and shingles. The first shipment of lumber was sold in New York City; shortly thereafter his business became successful. Hotel In 1802, Putnam purchased an acre of land from Henry Walton beside Congress Spring and hired carpenters to build the first hotel of Saratoga Springs. Completed and opened in 1803, the three-story guesthouse was named \\"Putnam's Tavern and Boarding House\\", though designated \\"Putnam's Folly\\" by locals for its \\"pretentiousness\\" and his \\"optimism and ambition\\". The guesthouse was rather conspicuous, for the entire area was blanketed in wilderness. At the time, the village comprised \\"a few log cabins, and the visitors were all invalids\\". New settlers in the area had the opportunity to buy plots of Putnam's property, and they instantly sold out. A couple years later, Putnam expanded the hotel, including a parlor, dining room, and ballroom. The guesthouse's name was later changed to \\"Union Hall\\". It was owned by Putnam's progeny until 1864, when it was sold to the Leland Brothers, who renamed it \\"Grand Union\\" in 1869. Planning the village In 1805, Putnam purchased more land from Walton‚Äî130 acres adjacent to the acre he had originally purchased near Congress Spring‚Äîand began to allocate the area. On the west side of the land, he arranged a village, which was to have broad roads, with the springs in the center. The springs were to be public‚Äî\\"forever remain open and free to the people\\". The southwest area was \\"set aside ... for a cemetery, which he later gave to the village, and he also provided land for a church of whichever denomination was established first\\". The Baptists were the first to build a church there. Putnam also had a plot for a school, and planted poplars alongside Broad street. Springs Putnam uncovered and tubed several mineral springs: in 1806, Washington Spring, in 1805, Columbian Spring, Hamilton Spring (named after Alexander Hamilton, son- in-law of Philip Schuyler, who was an earlier settler of Saratoga), and lastly, in 1809, Congress Spring. Gradually, more newcomers began visiting the village, so \\"to accommodate whom he built a bath house near the present Congres[s] Spring\\". Inhabitants of nearby Ballston came to eat dinner with Putnam and drink from Congress Spring. In 1811, seeing the success of the hotel, Putnam decided to build another one, which later became Congress Hall. Death While overseeing the construction of the future Congress Hall, Putnam fell off the scaffolding and broke some ribs. On December 1, 1812, at the age of 49, he died of a lung disease complication and pneumonia. It is said that some guests have seen the ghost of Mr. Putnam roaming the halls of the hotel. He was the first to be buried in Putnam's Cemetery, which he had himself laid out. Legacy Putnam is the namesake of the Gideon Putnam Hotel in Saratoga Spa State Park. Considering Putnam's accomplishments and contributions, in Our County and its People: a Descriptive and Biographical Record of Saratoga County, New York, George Baker Anderson concluded that \\"Gideon Putnam, though not the pioneer, was in reality the founder of the village of Saratoga Springs.\\" He said, \\"To Gideon Putnam belongs the credit for starting the boom which made Saratoga Springs a formidable rival of the famous Ballston Spa, a movement which eventually gave to the former place the prestige and glory which originally accompanied the name of the latter. It was his capital which laid the foundations of the famed Grand Union hotel, and gave that village a name which it has ever since borne‚Äîthe prince of watering places in America, and the peer of any in the world.\\" Richard L. Allen, Putnam's grand son-in-law, opined in An Analysis of the Principal Mineral Fountains at Saratoga Springs, \\"It was to Putnam that we are indebted, more than to any other individual for improvements at the Springs, during this period of its history. His enterprise and energy cleared away the forest trees from the adjacent plains, converted the rich pineries into materials and means for the further development of the town, erected public buildings for the accommodation of visitors, opened highways about the town, improved and laid out streets in the village; excavated, tubed and secured the mineral springs.... He was emphatically the man of his day in this locality, and he made such an impression on the place of his choice, that his name must be co- existent with the history of the village which his energy did so much to develop. He possessed a will which no ordinary obstacle could long withstand, and by his exertions the din and hum of civilization soon took the place of the deep and solemn murmur of the primitive pine forest.\\" Nathaniel Bartlett Sylvester declared in History of Saratoga County, New York, with Illustrations Biographical Sketches of Some of Its Prominent Men and Pioneers, \\"Gideon Putnam was in every sense a remarkable man. Possessed of indomitable perseverance, stern resolution, and invincible energy, he early encountered the trials and privations incident to a pioneer life, and carved out from the primitive forest one of the most beautiful villages in the country, and which has proved one of the most popular places of summer resort. Its broad streets, free fountains, and abundant religious and educational advantages bear testimony alike to his comprehensive ingenuity, his liberality, and his respect for truth. He not only gave the burial-ground to the village, but also the ground for the village academy, and to the Baptist church the ground on which it stands. He made such an impression on the place of his choice that his name must ever stand first among those whose early self-denials and energetic lives have conferred so much upon the village.\\" ReferencesBibliography       * External links *Gideon Putnam *Saratoga Springs History Category:1763 births Category:1812 deaths Category:People from Saratoga Springs, New York Category:American businesspeople Category:Burials in Saratoga County, New York ","title":"Gideon Putnam"},{"id":"29206477","title":"Peter Sturm"},{"id":"29206483","text":"Aed mac Ruaidr√≠ Ua Conchobair (died 1159) was Crown Prince of Connacht.

It was filmed in the spring of 1944, but was held back for a year because Paramount had a backlog of product and felt it was more important to get war-related films released first, lest they suddenly become dated by the impending end of combat. Plot Peter Marshall (Fred MacMurray), who works for the Trotter Poll (\\"like the Gallup Poll, but not as fast\\"), is sent out to find a missing co-worker, Hector Smedley. He goes to see the last family the man was supposed to interview, the nutty and murderous Fleagles. There he runs afoul of Mert and Bert Fleagle (both played by Peter Whitney), the gun-toting twin sons of Mamie Fleagle Smithers Johnson (Marjorie Main). As matriarch of the clan Mamie insists that Peter, to escape death at the hands of Mert or Bert, pretend to be the boyfriend of jailed Bonnie Fleagle in order to gain the confidence of her dying grandmother (Mabel Paige). Grandma Fleagle has hidden $70,000 stolen by Bonnie and her now-executed father, but refuses to divulge where to her unwanted relations for a very good reason: she tells Pete that she has been poisoned by them. Before she dies, she teaches Pete a nonsensical song which is also known to Elany Fleagle (Jean Heather), Mamie's dimwitted daughter. The Fleagles are sure Grandma told Pete where the money is hidden and keep him captive. Then, a woman claiming to be Bonnie shows up, also looking for the loot. When she gets Pete alone for questioning, she reveals she is actually Claire Matthews (Helen Walker). Her innocent father was maliciously implicated by Bonnie's father in the bank robbery. Pete wants to escape, now that they are alone, but Claire insists on staying. If she can retrieve the money, she can exonerate her father. The Fleagles try to poison Claire at dinner, but Pete accidentally discovers that all but one of their plates have been poisoned (the poison glows in the dark); only the dish in front of Mamie's third husband, Mr. Johnson (Porter Hall), is safe to eat. Johnson slips away, but is soon found glowing and dead. The uneasy situation is further complicated when the real Bonnie Fleagle (Barbara Pepper) breaks out of prison and comes for her money. She makes Pete sing the song and she understands the seemingly meaningless lyrics. Pete gets away, and he deciphers the clues hidden in the words, from which Claire finds a key to the safety deposit box. Soon, all of the Fleagles, including Mr. Johnson (who had faked his death), are chasing Pete and Claire through the various secret passageways of the house. The plucky pair are able to drop each of their pursuers into a hay baling machine, from which they emerge safely.

In the early 1900s Nicholson developed a new powered craft which would enable the owners to come from their \\"big-boats\\" before and after the competitions. Named the Gelyce class, the name derived from the combined first and last letter of their respective wives: Gertie, Lucy, and Constance. In 1912, Nicholson introduced the 15mR design Istria with a Marconi rig, the first yacht in the world with a lightweight, laminated wood construction. This led to further developments and growing expertise in the use of lightweight materials which saw its fruition in the use of plywood in deck construction. This ultimately led to arguably Nicholson's most beautiful sailing creation, the 1927 commissioned Vita (later Creole) was built on behalf of Alexander Smith Cochran. He died on 26 February 1954.

The 1928 Prayer Book was the basis for his compilation The Churchpeople's Prayer Book. Bishop Monahan accepted the principle of reservation of the blessed sacrament in church and also permitted devotional services of Benediction., which his immediate successor would later forbid. Despite his Anglo-Catholic churchmanship, however, Dr. Monahan's episcopate was notable for his deposing, in 1942, the extreme priest Edmund Loftus Macnachten, vicar of St Thomas, Overmonnow, who had adopted such Roman Catholic practices as processions of the Blessed Sacrament and who, according to records, had also absented himself from his parish without making provision for services to be taken.Parish Registers of St Thomas Overmonnow, held at Gwent Archives During Dr Monahan's time in the diocese many clergy who had trained at St Stephen's House, Oxford were recruited to the diocese, and for all the furore caused by the proceedings against MacNachten, the character of Monmouth became considerably more \\"High Church\\" under his leadership.

Though the earliest forms appeared in the 1900s, car songs emerged in full during the 1950s as part of rock and roll and car culture, but achieved their peak popularity in the West Coast of the United States during the 1960s with the emergence of hot rod rock as an outgrowth of the surf music scene. Though this popularity declined by the late 1960s, cars remain a frequently used subject matter in pop music into the 21st century. Origins  In the turn of the twentieth century, the recent invention of the automobile began to appear within popular music. Many of the earliest pieces had no lyrics, instead attempting to musically emulate the sounds of the automobile, such as \\"The Motor Car\\" (1903) and \\"The Auto Race\\" (1904). Dance, ragtime, and march compositions began emerging that, though wordless, were musically inspired by the automobile. Eventually, some of these songs took on words, such as Henry Krull's \\"Automobile Races\\". In 1905, Gus Edwards premiered the song \\"In My Merry Oldsmobile\\", a tune which Kenneth T. Jackson calls \\"the best-known car song ever written about the automobile.\\"  Full development  The car song began to emerge in full in the burgeoning rock and roll scene in the early 1950s. Jackie Brenston had a hit with \\"Rocket 88\\", attributed to Ike Turner, praising the Oldsmobile Rocket 88. Chuck Berry had a song entitled \\"Jaguar and Thunderbird\\". Among the best known of the genre were \\"Hot Rod Race\\" by Arkie Shibley and His Mountain Dew Boys and the answer song \\"Hot Rod Lincoln\\" by Charlie Ryan. Although the Johnny Mercer song \\"Skylark\\" was actually released in 1942, it became the inspiration for the Buick Skylark that debuted in 1953. Many 1950s songs could serve as soundtracks to play in one's car when approaching a drive-in restaurant or meeting someone. \\"Walk Don't Run\\" by The Ventures, \\"Rumble\\" by Link Wray, or \\"Sleep Walk\\" by Santo & Johnny could all serve a slow entrance, \\"Let's Go for a Ride\\" by The Collegians, \\"You Can't Catch Me\\" by Chuck Berry, or \\"Rebel-'Rouser\\" by Duane Eddy worked for a more speedy approach, and \\"No Particular Place to Go\\" by Chuck Berry worked for all situations. Many groups emerged that took their names from car brands: The Impalas, The El Dorados, The Belaires, The Cadillacs, The Fleetwoods, The Starfires, The Continentals, The Bonnevilles, The Rivieras, Little Anthony and the Imperials, among numerous others.  Hot rod rock  The Beach Boys performing in 1964 The muscle car craze, as well as the surge of interest in sports car racing, brought several cars referencing performance cars. The Beach Boys, already a highly successful rock band, tapped into the California cruising and drag racing culture, spearheading a short-lived rock music craze commonly referred to as \\"hot rod rock\\". Author Geoffrey Himes wrote \\"The music was only subtly different [from surf music]\\". According to The Ultimate Hot Rod Dictionary by Jeff Breitenstein: From 1961 to 1965, some fifteen hundred car songs were recorded. Alongside The Beach Boys, Jan and Dean, Ronny and the Daytonas, and The Fantastic Baggys all rose to the forefront of the scene. As in the 1950s, many groups adopted the names of car brands, but this time with a greater emphasis on hot rods, such as The Duece Coupes, The Duals, The GTOs, The Dragsters, The Roadsters, The T-Bones, and The Roadrunners. Some of the most popular car songs to emerge in this era include:  Later years After the hot rod music period ended by the mid-1960s, car songs, though still frequent, did not enjoy the same level of popularity.

After the British signed a treaty making the state a protectorate, he was restored on 22 January 1887, ruling until his death. Background The Kingdom of Bonny was a trading state founded before 1600, based on the port of Bonny in what is now Rivers State, Nigeria. It became a major trading center, first of slaves and later of palm oil products. During the 19th century, British influence was growing in the region. George Oruigbiji Pepple was born in 1849, son of King William Dappa Pepple of Bonny, who was deposed by the British and deported to Britain in 1854. George went into exile with his father, and was educated in England at the boys‚Äô school at Hall Place, Bexley in southeast London. His studies included English, Greek, Mathematics, Scripture and History, the conventional syllabus of Victorian England. During his father's exile, Bonny was torn by struggles, at times violent, between two rival factions attached to the ruling house. The Manilla Pepple faction was led by Chief Oko Jumbo, but was racked by internal dissension. It was opposed by the Anna or Annie Pepple faction, led by Chief Jubo Jubogha, known as Ja-Ja to the British. In an attempt to restore peace, the British brought King William Dappa back and restored him to the throne in August 1861, reigning until his death in September 1866. First reign George Pepple became king in succession to his father on 30 September 1866, taking the regnal name of Perekule VII. He was a Christian, and on his accession wrote to Bishop Crowther giving his support for introduction of the religion in Bonny. On 21 April 1867, supported by Oko Jumbo and other Manilla Pepple chiefs, he declared the iguana was no longer the sacred deity of the kingdom. His association with Christianity, at first welcomed by many people for the benefits it gave, gradually made him become identified with British interests and caused growing resentment. The tension between the Manilla Pepple and Annie Pepple houses revived. In June 1867 there was a two-day skirmish between the factions, which King George managed to end by threatening to personally shoot the ringleaders. In 1869 a major battle between the two factions led to Ja-Ja founding a new state of Opobo, further inland at the village of Andoni, taking some of the palm oil trade away from Bonny. On 16 March 1870, George sailed for England, where he called for more forceful action by the British, a plea that was accepted. The British consul Livingston was supplied with a gunboat with which he sailed up the river to Andoni and imposed peace. In 1879 George fell ill, and when he recovered took his doctor's advice to take a holiday in England. He was received well, his actions were reported in the press, and he was introduced to the Prince of Wales. He was also presented with a steam launch at the end of his visit. All this caused considerable alarm among the chiefs, concerned about his growing power, combined with the growing power of the British. He came close to being deposed on his return but was saved by the British consul. On 14 December 1883 King George was deposed. Restoration In February 1886 a protectorate treaty was concluded between Bonny and Britain. A ruling council was established, and King George Pepple was restored to his throne. Oko Jumbo was publicly degraded, his bans on Christianity were repealed and afterwards he was a spent force in Bonny politics. King George died in October 1888, and was succeeded by a series of regents. He was buried in the British Cemetery of Funchal, Madeira. The cemetery today is administered and financed by the Anglican Holy Trinity Church, Rua Quebra Costa, Funchal, and has public access daily.

On returning to civilian life after the war, he decided to try his luck as an actor under the name of Purdell and gained experience on the stage through the 1920s. His move into films in 1930 coincided with the advent of the talkie era in British cinema. Purdell's first screen appearance was in the 1930 comedy The Middle Watch, in a role he would later reprise in a 1940 remake. He next travelled to Germany to feature in historical drama Congress Dances, an ambitious and lavishly budgeted project by the UFA film company, involving the simultaneous filming of three versions of the same story in German, English and French in an attempt to prove that a European company could challenge the dominance of American studios in the new era of sound by delivering a continent-wide hit. Purdell soon began to accumulate screen credits in a wide variety of films ranging from cheaply made quota quickies to more sophisticated productions. He showed a knack for playing comedy, and his 1930s films fell mainly into this genre, with occasional ventures into straight drama and thrillers. Purdell's screenwriting career began in 1932 and he was most productive in this field during the late 1930s, with only occasional ventures later in his career. He tried his hand at film directing in 1937 with two comedies Don't Get Me Wrong, a Max Miller vehicle co-directed with Arthur B. Woods, and Patricia Gets Her Man. Both films were reasonably well-received, but Purdell appears to have decided that directing was not for him, as there would be no more ventures in this area. In the 1940s Purdell's acting career diversified, with fewer throwaway comedies and more appearances in high-quality dramatic vehicles. His credits included war dramas We Dive at Dawn and Two Thousand Women, Gainsborough melodrama Love Story, notorious box- office flop musical London Town and the classic Brighton Rock. Purdell's last screen appearance was in 1951.\\"Reginald Purdell, British Actor, Dead\\" New York Times, 23 April 1953.

He wrote extensively on the history of licit and illicit drugs and the process by which many of them were placed under governmental control. Education Musto was born January 8, 1936, in Tacoma, Washington and earned his undergraduate degree in classics from the University of Washington in 1956. He attended Yale University on a fellowship, earning a master's degree in the history of science and medicine in 1961.

Career Musto first developed a focus on drug policy when he became special assistant to the director of the National Institute of Mental Health through the United States Public Health Service. He taught briefly at Johns Hopkins University and became a professor of child psychiatry at the Yale Child Study Center beginning in 1969, in addition to being a professor of the history of medicine at Yale School of Medicine.Staff. \\"In Memoriam: Dr. David Musto\\", Yale University Office of Public Affairs & Communications, October 13, 2010.

Musto was a supporter of methadone maintenance as a way of weaning heroin addicts from their addiction. He questioned the efficacy of employee drug testing and needle exchange programs. Musto was wary of government efforts to curb drug use, noting that efforts to control drugs arise \\"from repeated observation of the damage to acquaintances and society\\" but that a prevention effort \\"usually comes just after the popularity of drugs has peaked\\". By 1992 Musto believed that the cocaine epidemic in the U.S. had already hit its peak, but challenged the notion that legalization of cocaine and other drugs would curb their effects on society.Rierden, Andi. \\"CONNECTICUT Q&A;: DR.

Books His 1973 book The American Disease: Origins of Narcotic Control, expanded and reissued in 1987 and 1999, presents a history of drug use, abuse and control from the 19th century to the time of publication. Describing the connection between drug prohibition and their use by minority populations, it was written in \\"a non-polemical tone rare in a field dominated by partisan zealots\\". The New York Times Book Review called the book \\"mandatory reading for anyone who wants to understand how we got into our present mess\\". His 2002 book The Quest for Drug Control: Politics and Federal Policy in a Period of Increasing Substance Abuse, 1963-1981, co- authored with Pamela Korsmeyer, documents the often fragmented approach to drug policy taken by the federal government in the 1960s and 1970s.Lewis, David C. \\"The Quest for Drug Control: Politics and Federal Policy in a Period of Increasing Substance Abuse, 1963-1981\\", Journal of the American Medical Association, 2003;290:1647-1648.

He is a Lieutenant General in the Uganda People's Defence Force (UPDF) and was the commander of the Special Forces Group, which contains the unit known as Presidential Guard Brigade responsible for providing security to the President of Uganda and to Uganda's constitutional monarchs, from 2008 to 2017. The Special Forces Group is also responsible for providing security at Uganda's oil installations. He is the son of President Yoweri Museveni, Commander in Chief of the UPDF and president of Uganda . Muhoozi has served as Senior Presidential Adviser for Special Operations since 2017. Family Kainerugaba was born on 24 April 1974 in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania to Yoweri Museveni, who has been President of Uganda since 1986, and Janet Museveni, the Minister of Education and Sports since 6 June 2016. Muhoozi Kainerugaba is their first- born. He is married to Charlotte Nankunda Kutesa, and together they have 3 children. Education As a child, Kainerugaba attended schools in Tanzania, Mount Kenya Academy in Nyeri Kenya and Sweden. After his father became President of Uganda, he attended Kampala Parents School, King's College Budo for a while and St. Mary's College Kisubi, a residential middle and high school, located approximately halfway between Kampala and Entebbe. He graduated in 1994. He was later admitted to Egyptian Military Academy where he took both the company and battalion commanders courses. He also has attended the Kalama Armoured Warfare Training School, in Kabamba, Mubende District, Central Uganda. In 2007 he was admitted to a one-year course at the United States Army Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, graduating in June 2008. Following that, he successfully completed the Executive National Security Programme at the South African National Defence College. Military career Upon his return to Uganda from Sandhurst in 2000, Kainerugaba was assigned to the Presidential Protection Unit as a second lieutenant. In 2001, he was promoted to the rank of major in the UPDF. As a major, he became a brigade commander in the Presidential Guard Brigade. Following his graduation from Fort Leavenworth in 2008, he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel and appointed Commander of the Special Forces Group in the Uganda People's Defence Force. On 16 May 2016 he was promoted to the rank of major general by President Museveni. Museveni moved Muhoozi to the post of Senior Presidential Adviser for Special Operations on 10 January 2017. The move was generally viewed in light of the widespread belief that Museveni was preparing his son to eventually succeed him as president. Observers suggested that, by appointing Muhoozi as a presidential adviser, Museveni sought to give his son some political experience.

It was designed and being developed by Avro in competition with the Saunders-Roe-built SR.53. While at least one prototype was partially- constructed, the order for the Avro 720, and quickly thereafter the project entirely, was terminated prior to any aircraft having been completed. The Avro 720 was intended to have been a high-performance aircraft that would have utilised mixed propulsion to accomplish this, using a rocket engine to achieve quick acceleration and a high top speed while a more compact jet engine would have been used during more mundane cruising flight. The termination of the aircraft had been partially due to its choice in powerplant, Avro having opted to utilise the in-development Armstrong Siddeley Screamer rocket engine, which used liquid oxygen as oxidant and kerosene fuel; major questions were posed over the oxidant's practicality under operational situations. Development=Origins The Second World War had demonstrated the importance of strategic bombing to modern warfare, and as the emerging Cold War developed, the development of new and more effective air defences against large waves of hostile bomber aircraft armed with nuclear weapons became a priority for many nations. During the war, Nazi Germany had extensively developed its own rocket-powered aircraft to augment its interception capabilities, in the final two years of the war, it had been able to deploy aircraft such as the Messerschmitt Me 163 (and design Bachem Ba 349) which, by using rocket propulsion, had been capable of unparalleled rates-of-climb, enabling them to (at least in theory) rapidly sortie to intercept enemy bombers before they reached their targets. As the performance of these aircraft had become increasingly well known to the Allies, RAF experts were eager to explore and understand the underlying technology.Wood 1975, p. 53. In the aftermath of the war, German rocket technology was studied extensively by various members of the former Allied nations. Britain had quickly opted to commence a programme to develop liquid-propellant rockets with the aim of boosting aircraft during the take-off phase, known within the RAF as rocket-assisted take-off gear (RATOG), and during the climb-to-altitude phase of flight. In 1946, work began on a pair of new British-built rocket motors, the de Havilland Sprite (5,000 lb thrust) and the Armstrong Siddeley Snarler (2,000 lb thrust); these rocket motors made use of different propellants, the Sprite used a high-test peroxide (HTP) monopropellant while the Snarler harnessed a methanol/water/liquid oxygen mix. During the early 1950s, both engines proceeded to the flight testing phase; however, some of the demand for their role to provide fighters with increased performance was soon being met by the increasing prevalence of conventional jet engines being equipped with reheat instead. In May 1951, faced with reports on the increasingly potential capability of, and thus the threat posed by, the growing Soviet strategic bomber fleet and that nation's newly developed atomic weapons, the British Air Ministry proceeded to draft an Operational Requirement, OR 301, which sought a rocket-powered interceptor that could attain an altitude of 60,000 ft (18,300 m) in just 2 minutes 30 seconds. Many of the performance requirement laid out by OR 301 was due to the anticipation of rapid increases in performance by the opposing Soviet aircraft; by the early 1960s, it was suspected that these bombers might well be capable of supersonic speeds of up to Mach 2 with a potential operational altitude as high as 80,000 ft.Wood 1975, pp. 53‚Äì54. Avro's design team promptly set about designing an suitable interceptor that conformed with the specification's requirements, which would result in the Avro 720 proposal. In addition, various other proposals from a number of companies were received, including Bristol, Blackburn, Shorts and Saunders-Roe. Accordingly, the specification was aimed at providing a capable defence interceptor that could form part of the nation's measures to counter this threat would need to be capable of similar speeds and an exceptionally high rate of climb in order to reach high altitude bombers in time.Wood 1975, pp. 54‚Äì55. Conceptually, the envisioned aircraft was to be operated in a similar fashion to that of the German Me 163, it would use its rocket engine to climb rapidly to meet and engage its target prior to gliding back to earth in a fuel-exhausted state before landing upon a retractable skid arrangement. According to aviation author Derek Wood, Saunders-Roe had quickly identified that the unpowered 'glide home' return flight could be a source of danger and expense, and thus approached the Air Ministry to discuss their concept for the adoption of a secondary jet engine, which would be used for the purposes of powering the interceptor's journey home. The Ministry was enthusiastic on this concept; in May 1951, all interested companies were asked to examine this arrangement.Wood 1975, p. 55. Revised specification and selection If designed strictly to deliver the performance required by the original specification, the interceptor would have been forced to glide back to ground from heights of up to 100,000 ft (30,500 m), perform an unpowered landing many miles away, after which it would then have to be recovered and taken back to the airfield by ground vehicle. Revised specifications from the Ministry were issued to Avro and Saunders-Roe, under which the auxiliary turbojet engine had become an official and explicitly-stated requirement. The auxiliary engine was required to provide sufficient power to allow the interceptor to fly back to its base in the aftermath of a combat mission.Jones Aeroplane Monthly November 1994, pp. 32‚Äì33.Mason 1992, p. 400. On 12 December 1952, further refinement of the rocket interceptor concept had led to the release of the defined Specification OR 337.London 2010, p. 31. The changes contained within the defined specification mainly revolved around armament changes, such as the adoption of the Blue Jay (as it was codenamed at the time) infrared-guided air-to-air missile under development, which replaced the originally-envisaged retractable battery of 2-inch rockets.\\"The History of the Saunders Roe S.R.53 and S.R.177\\"Wood 1975, p. 56. On 5 May 1953, an advisory design conference was hosted at the Ministry of Supply, which focused on the Saunders-Roe submission; three days later, a formal contract for the production of three prototypes was received by Saunders-Roe. However, due to doubts within the RAF and the Ministry over the correct fuel/motor combination to select for the interceptor intended to meet the Specification, it was decided to issue a modified specification, which was later led to a development contract, for the competing Avro 720 aircraft as well. Of the six companies that decided to tender proposals, two were selected for development contracts: Avro with their Avro 720 and Saunders-Roe with the SR.53.Wood 1975, pp. 56‚Äì57. In response, a pair of prototypes were ordered by the Ministry. In December 1956, it was reported that the Screamer engine, what had been intended to power the Avro 720, successfully completed flight clearance tests.Flight 27 July 1956, p. 164. Early development work on the Avro 720 was also proceeding smoothly; by 1956, the first prototype was claimed to have been virtually completed and that Avro viewed it as being capable of flying up to a year ahead of the rival SR.53.Wood 1975, pp. 60‚Äì61. However, neither development programmes had managed to secure the backing of the Royal Air Force (RAF), which had been showing signs of hesitancy and had apparent intentions to wait until after both aircraft flight evaluations had been conducted before the service would expressly make any determination on its preference.Wood 1975, p. 57. From September 1953 onwards, both the Avro 720 and the SR.53 projects were subject to increasing levels of scrutiny amid an overall requirement within the Ministry to implement cuts in order to reduce costs. However, the Avro 720 was dealt an effective death blow when the Screamer rocket engine which was to power the interceptor was cancelled during late 1956. Reportedly, official concerns regarding the practicality of using liquid oxygen, which boils at -183 ¬∞C (90 K) and is a fire hazard, within an operational environment had heavily contributed to the Screamer's cancellation. The loss of the main engine in turn ultimately led to the termination of the Avro 720.London 2010, p. 30.Flight 24 May 1957, pp. 698‚Äì699. One of the reasons for the Ministry's preferment of the SR.53, despite its development programme being comparatively behind and having suffered greater delays, was its rocket engine's use of hydrogen peroxide as an oxidiser had been viewed as less problematic than the Screamer's liquid oxygen oxidiser, and the Ministry did not want to support two separate rocket fuel programmes.Wood 1975, p. 61. At the time of cancellation, a single structural test airframe was partially complete. According to aviation author Barry Jones, photographs of the structural airframe, with the port wing fitted and the serial number XD696 painted on, have sometimes been mistakenly claimed to have been of the first prototype. The Avro 720 had reportedly cost ¬£1 million by the time of cancellation, while its Screamer powerplant cost a further ¬£0.65 million.Flight 17 August 1967, p. 262. Design The Avro Type 720 was a small tailless delta-winged aircraft. It was constructed of metal honeycomb sandwich. The Avro 720's main power- plant was an 8,000 lbf (36 kN) Armstrong Siddeley Screamer rocket engine, using liquid oxygen as oxidant and kerosene fuel. This differed from the competing Saunders-Roe SR.53, which used a de Havilland Spectre rocket engine which was fuelled by kerosene with Hydrogen Peroxide oxidiser. Both types were equipped with a single Armstrong-Siddeley Viper as the auxiliary turbojet engine; on the Avro design, airflow for the Viper engine was provided via a small chin inlet installed under the aircraft's nose. Operationally, the Avro 720 was to have been armed with a pair of de Havilland Firestreak Infrared homing air-to-air missiles, which could be carried upon under-wing pylons.

In fairness to Lane it must be remembered that only a few years earlier he and his family had been close to starvation,Fraser p.146 and he may well have felt that he had the right to make sure that they would have a secure future. Family He had one surviving son, James and two daughters‚ÄîMary and Charlotte‚Äîby his first wife Dorcas Brabazon, daughter of Sir Anthony Brabazon and Margaret Hovenden, and niece of William Brabazon, 1st Earl of Meath, as well as several sons who died young. James succeeded him as second and last Viscount. His second wife was Susannah Nicholas, daughter of the prominent statesman Sir Edward Nicholas and his wife Jane Jay, by whom he had three children who died young. She died in 1671. His third wife was Frances Sackville (daughter of Richard Sackville, 5th Earl of Dorset and Lady Frances Cranfield)'Sepulchral memorials of the Sackville family', Collectanea Topographica et Genealogica (1836), pp. 300-304. by whom he had another daughter, Frances. Frances married Ulick Burke, 1st Viscount Galway a Jacobite Colonel in the Irish Army, who was killed at the Battle of Aughrim in 1691. She married secondly Henry Fox and had issue including George Fox-Lane, 1st Baron Bingley, the eventual heir to the Lanesborough estates. Lady Frances, Dowager Viscountess Lanesborough purchased manors and lands in Cobham, Surrey from the Gavell and Smither families (representing the ancestral Bigley, Sutton and Downe or Adowne patrimonies associated with Chertsey Abbey) in 1708 and 1720,T.E.C. Walker, 'Cobham: Manorial History', Surrey Archaeological Collections 58 (1961), pp. 47-78. and died in January 1721/22. Diary of Samuel Pepys Lanesborough is mentioned several times in the Diary of Samuel Pepys. Peys refers to his \\"below stairs\\" influence at Court, the alleged corruption of his Irish administration, and his celebrated lawsuit over a disputed property claim with the historian Philip Hore, who is now chiefly remembered for his history of County Wexford.Diary 18/11/1664 References *http://www.leighrayment.com/baronetage/baronetsL1.htm *http://www.leighrayment.com/peers/peersL1.htm *http://www.leighrayment.com/pcouncil/pcouncilI.htm *http://thepeerage.com/p13095.htm#i130943 *https://web.archive.org/web/20120303015431/http://www.cracroftspeerage.co.uk/online/content/index1635.htm Category:1620s births Category:1683 deaths Category:Irish MPs 1661‚Äì1666 Category:Viscounts in the Peerage of Ireland Category:Peers of Ireland created by Charles II Category:Members of the Privy Council of Ireland Category:Chief Secretaries for Ireland Category:Fellows of the Royal Society Category:Members of the Parliament of Ireland (pre-1801) for County Roscommon constituencies ","title":"George Lane, 1st Viscount Lanesborough"},{"id":"29207620","text":"Eilert is a male given name and may refer to: *Edvard Eilert Christie (1773‚Äì1831), Norwegian businessperson and politician *Eilert B√∏hm (1900‚Äì1982), Norwegian gymnast who competed in the 1920 Summer Olympics *Eilert Dahl (1919‚Äì2004), Norwegian Nordic skier who competed in the late 1940s and early 1950s *Eilert Ekwall (born 1877), Professor of English at Lund University, Sweden, from 1909 to 1942 *Eilert Falch-Lund (1875‚Äì1960), Norwegian sailor who competed in the 1908 and 1912 Summer Olympics *Eilert M√§√§tt√§ (born 1935), retired Swedish professional ice hockey player and coach *Eilert Pilarm (born 1953), Swedish Elvis impersonator *Eilert Stang Lund (born 1939), Norwegian judge *Eilert Sundt (1817‚Äì1875), Norwegian sociologist, known for his work on mortality, marriage and working class subjects See also *Eilert Sundts Gate, street in Oslo that goes from Gyldenl√∏vsgate by Arno Bergs square at Briskeby to Bogstadveien Category:Masculine given names ","title":"Eilert"},{"id":"29207647","text":"Burhaniye is a neighborhood in the √úsk√ºdar municipality on the Asian side of Istanbul, Turkey.

An alternative title is the True Meaning of Jihad. It was published on 22 May 1900 and was translated into English in 2006, by Islam International Publications.The British Government and Jihad, Mirza Ghulam Ahmad (1900) The Founder of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Jamaat refers to the Qur'an and the Ahadith (sayings) of the Islamic prophet Muhammad in order to explain the true nature of the Islamic concept of jihad. The author points to the peaceful nature of the Islamic faith and explains that Muhammad resorted to defensive war only after suffering thirteen years of brutal oppression. Divine permission to retaliate was granted for the specific purpose of self-defense, to punish aggressors, and to uphold freedom of conscience. He also argues that the command to fight and retaliate was for that specific condition in which the early Muslims found themselves. Opposition to God‚Äôs messengers The author explains why a new messenger of God finds such a great opposition from the pre-existing communities and their religious leaders. He believes it is out of anger and jealousy and the fear that their incomes shall go down if the new message and reformation succeeded. He writes, the new reformer unmasks the deficiencies of their leaders. He claims, for similar reasons the pagans, Christian and Jewish communities and their leaders strongly opposed the Islamic Prophet Muhammad and his community. He writes, ‚Äúmembers of this faction are in fact deficient; they possess very little of Divine light and their flaws are totally exposed during a Prophet or Messenger‚Äôs time. Their egos give rise to hostility towards God‚Äôs Prophets and the righteous, and they selfishly devise plans to injure them.\\" (The British Government and Jihad, p. 5) Ahmad believes, the existing Arab communities, ‚Äúfeared that the firm establishment of this religion would in turn sow the seeds of destruction for their faith and nation.‚Äù (p. 6) and it was the main reason behind the Muslim community was so strongly opposed and acts of extreme ‚Äúcruelty and brutality were committed against them‚Äù.  Trials and tribulations  Ahmad states, \\"For a lengthy thirteen year period‚Äù the Muslim community suffered extreme oppression but they were instructed, not to retaliate. ‚Äúthe streets ran red with their blood, they did not utter a sound. They were slaughtered like animals but did not protest.‚Äù (p. 7). He writes, \\"They were trampled underfoot but did not utter a sound.‚Äù Ahmad describes the extreme torture which the Muslim community suffered. God's permission to retaliate Ahmad discusses in reference to the verse 22:39 of the Quran, \\"Permission [to fight] has been given to those who are being fought, because they were wronged. And indeed, Allah is competent to give them victory\\".The Quran, 22: 39 , Quran Surah Al- Hajj ( Verse 39 ) (p. 7). He believed this was the verse that described the real philosophy of Jihad. Command to fight specific to that time period Mirza Ghulam Ahmad believed, this Command (Quran 22:39) to retaliate and fight was specific to the time period of the Prophet and the prevailing circumstances only: He writes: Medieval Muslim Jurists Erred  The author is of the opinion that failure to comprehend the true import of this verse, the early Muslim jurists and scholars committed profound error, and shed the blood of innocent human beings in the name of Holy War or Jihad. This belief appears unique among the past Muslim jurists. Today's Muslim scholars The author of the treatise believes that present day religious scholars (Maulavis) are entirely misguided in comprehending the true philosophy of Jihad and they keep preaching such dangerous and blood-spattered doctrines among the ignorant Muslims, which have become the cause of extremism and violence in the society. He writes, \\" Maulavis who persist in propagating these blood-spattered doctrines are in fact responsible for murders committed by ignorant, egotistical people who know nothing of why Islam was forced to fight battles in its early history\\".(p. 9) Mualavis and Christian priests Commenting upon the then prevalent \\"Jihadist\\" movements among the Indian Muslims Mirza Ghulam Ahmad holds responsible, besides the Maulavis, the Christian priests, who incited the ignorant masses of the Muslim society, about the misguided concept of Jihad. He writes: Ahmad writes the Christian missionaries have also spread this misguided belief of Jihad by distributing provocative literature in Urdu, Pashto and other languages, to preach the false views that \\"Islam was spread by the sword\\".(p. 11) This in a way served as a combined testimony of the Maulavis and Christian Missionaries, to incite people to violent acts and create unrest. Why Act XXIII of 1867 failed Commenting upon the failure of Act Number XXIII of 1867, in order to check the spread of the militant ideas of the Frontier's residents, Ahmad believed it was due to the continued provocative and bitter writings of priests like Imad ud-din Lahiz Reverend ‚ÄòImad-ud-Din, a former Muslim, was one of the many priests who published extensively against Islam during this period. of Amritsar and some other foul-mouthed priests who greatly damaged goodwill and reconciliation within the country. A dangerous course Ahmad saw a great danger in the combined Testimony of the Christian Missionaries and Maulavis who spread a violent view of the Muslim concept of Jihad. At the same time he perceived the dangerous consequences of the naive strategy of the Christian clergy and wrote: What should the government do To suggest a remedy to the British Government in India (1900) Ahmad advised a three-step policy, which will greatly control the poisonous growth of envy and spite, among the various strata of the Indian society: Hypocrisy of Maulavis Ahmad, has admonished the Muslim scholars (Maulavis) to shun hypocrisy. He believed when, \\"they meet present day rulers, they bow down as if ready to prostrate; but among their own kind they insist repeatedly that this country is ‚Äúdar-ul-harb‚Äù [the zone of war]. They consider jihad to be obligatory in their hearts, and few of them think otherwise\\" (p. 11). He advised the Maulavis restore true sincerity. He believed if they pondered over the Quran and Ahadith, they may realize the truth. This is not the time for Jihad The author of the book, Mirza Ghulam Ahmad who claims to be the promised Messiah admonished the Muslims in very strong words, telling this was not the time for Jihad i.e. any kind of armed combat: The Messiah admonishes He writes, I as the promised Messiah admonish you: I came to end religious wars ::I have come to you with an order: jihad with the sword has ended from this time forward, but the jihad of purifying your souls must continue. I do not say this of my own accord. This is indeed the will of God. Recall the hadith from Sahih al- Bukhari which honours the Promised Messiah by saying yada-‚Äòul-harb. That is to say, when the Messiah comes he will put an end to religious wars. (p. 18) The tradition prevalent among Muslims of attacking the people of other religions, which they call jihad, is not the jihad of Divine religious Law [Shari‚Äòah]. Rather, it is a grievous sin and a violation of the clear instructions of God and His Prophet. It may not be easy for certain Muslims to abandon this custom since it is well established among some tribes. p. 21) Advice to Amir of Kabul Ahmad also addressed the Amir of Kabal The Amir of the Afghan at that time was ‚ÄòAbdur Rahman (1881‚Äì1901). He ascended to the throne after the second Afghan war (1878‚Äì80) and was recognised as the Amir of Kabul on the condition that he would not have political relations with any foreign power other than the British. to \\"convene a discussion on the true nature of jihad. These religious scholars can then educate the public about its errors.\\" (p. 22) Thus spreading a more peaceful and better understanding of Jihad among the people of Afghanistan. For Ahmad believed \\"it is mostly Afghans who commit these acts and wield the sword with the intent of becoming ghazis, and a sizable majority of them live in his country. These barbaric practices defame Islam and he should do his best to cleanse the Afghan nation of them.\\" (p. 23) Afghanistan will suffer Probably Ahmad knew, the Amir of Kabal was not going to pay heed to any of his councils, so he warned the Afghans of bitter consequences of their extremism: Claims to be the Messiah and Mahdi At the end of the booklet, Ahmad has put forth his claim to Divine Relation, and that he was the promised Messiah and Mahdi: \\"Did this age not need the avatar [second coming] of Jesus the Messiah? Of course it did. Currently, millions of Muslims are ready to kill other people under the pretense of jihad. Indeed, some are unable to truly love a benevolent government even while living under its protection. They are unable to reach the highest levels of sympathy, and cannot cleanse themselves of affectation and pretence. There was therefore a dire need for the avatar of the Messiah. So I am that very promised avatar, who has been sent in the spiritual likeness, personality and temperament of Jesus the Messiah\\". (p. 33)  My message will spread God has Himself provided the means for fulfilling His prophecy that the message of the Messiah will spread in the world like lightning and will encompass all four corners of the earth like the light from a tower. The railways, telegraph, steamships, excellent postal services, easy modes of travel and tourism and other such means have been established to fulfill the prophecy that the message of the Messiah will illuminate every corner like lightning.

His mother was a Morisca. He succeeded his father as ruler of Algiers, and replaced Barbarossa's deputy Hasan Agha who had been effectively holding the position of ruler of Algiers since 1533. Ruler of Algiers Hasan Pasha became ruler of Algiers when his father was called to Constantinople in 1545. Barbarossa died peacefully in the Ottoman capital in 1546. In June 1545, Hasan Pasha occupied the city of Tlemcen, where he set a Turkish garrison, and put pro-Ottoman Sultan Muhammad on the throne. In 1548, he was replaced as Beylerbeyi of Algiers by the Ottoman Admiral Turgut Reis, who was nominated by Suleiman the Magnificent. Hasan Pasha again became ruler of Algiers, but he was recalled in 1552, on the reason that he was one of the causes of the conflict between the Turks and Morocco. He was replaced by Salah Rais, who nevertheless marched on Fez and occupied the city in early 1554, when the Moroccan ruler Mohammed ash-Sheikh rejected cooperation with the Ottomans. Hasan Pasha was again named beylerbey of Algiers in June 1557, in order to continue the fight against the Moroccan ruler, who had formed an alliance with the Spanish against the Ottomans. He had Mohammed ash-Sheikh assassinated in October 1557. Ottoman cannon cast in Algiers on 8 October 1581, soon after the rule of Hasan Pasha, by founder Ca'fer el-Mu'allim.

He reembarked from the port of Qassasa in northern Morocco, and from there returned to Algiers to prepare a defense against the Spaniards. After the Ottoman victory in the Expedition of Mostaganem (1558), Hasan Pasha was recalled again to Constantinople, apparently because of conflicts with his troops. He again became Beylerbey of Algiers in 1562, and led the unsuccessful Sieges of Oran and Mers El K√©bir in 1563.

His body was afterwards illicitly buried in an unmarked grave in a peat bog at Carrickrobbin, near Hackballcross in County Louth, five miles from his home in Crossmaglen, the decision having been taken by the Provisional IRA to deny involvement with his disappearance and conceal the evidence of his murder to avoid alienating the community of the village of Crossmaglen, where the Welsh surname of Evans was common.'Disappeared but not forgotten: the grim secrets the IRA could not bury', 'The Guardian', 10 May 2014. https://www.theguardian.com/uk- news/2014/may/10/disappeared-ira-troubles-northern-ireland Recovery of the body In October 2010 the Sunday Tribune journalist Suzanne Breen published a story that she had received information about the location of Evans' body from an ex-member of the Provisional IRA's \\"South Armagh Brigade\\", the source also giving the details of Evans' kidnap and murder.

It is located on the heights of the confluence of the Aisne and the Vesle near the communes of Cond√©-sur-Aisne and Chivres-Val. Although the fort was considered obsolete at the start of World War I, its command of strategic ground made it a coveted objective throughout the war, changing hands several times. Following the war it was used in support service before its abandonment and purchase by a local community. It has been under preservation since 1979 and may be visited. Military function The Fort de Cond√© comprised part of the outermost defenses fortifications that denied access to Paris for an invading force, one of several similar forts in the vicinity of Laon. These forts were constructed in response to the French defeat in the Franco-Prussian War, in which France lost its eastern provinces to Germany, forcing France to build new and updated frontier fortifications. The Fort de Cond√© controlled the high ground along the Chemin des Dames, which linked Reims, Laon and Soissons, and could bombard the Aisne and Vesle valleys. The fort also provided support to the nearby Fort de la Malmaison. Description The five-sided masonry fort was built by Dollot and Fortier at a cost of 1,850,000 francs-d'or. The fort covered and could accommodate almost 650 men and 20 officers. An infirmary for 80 invalids was also provided, as well as stabling for 12 horses, powder and ammunition magazines, a forge, a workshop and two wells. The fort featured two Mougin casemates mounting 155mm guns, as well as an initial18 guns on the rampart and 8 guns in a separate battery. Two casemates in the main fort were planned to provide indirect fire. The fort is roughly pentagonal, and features two double caponiers and a single caponier. One of the double caponiers provides covering fire to the fort's entrance. History In 1885 two companies of the French 67th Infantry Regiment (500 men) occupied the fort. Unfortunately, technological progress in explosives had overtaken fortress design and construction, and the fort was obsolete, insufficiently resistant to high-explosive artillery shells. The fort became a simple casernement for military personnel. The fort was abandoned in 1912 as a result of its functional obsolescence. The fort's location close to the Chemin des Dames made the fort a coveted objective by both sides during the First World War. Captured without resistance by the Germans on 1 September 1914, the fort was recaptured by French and British forces on 15 September after several attacks, but was re-taken by the Germans in a counter-attack. The site was used as a German hospital until it was returned to France without opposition in the Chemin des Dames offensive on 16 April 1917. Generals Pershing and Franchet d‚ÄôEsp√©rey observed fighting along the Chemin des Dames from the post in October 1917. The fort was recaptured by the Germans on 28 May 1918 during the May offensive, and recaptured by France on 7 August 1918. It was finally decommissioned as a fortification in 1927. The fort served as a center for the disassembly of explosive shells until it was purchased by the commune of Chivres-Val for use as a quarry in 1959. An association to restore the fort was formed in 1979, handing over custody of the fort in 2000 to the Communaut√© de Communes du Val de l‚ÄôAisne which has undertaken restoration work. The site is used for exhibitions, theater and son et lumi√®re shows. Since 2001 the Fort de Cond√© has been recorded on the French Inventaire Suppl√©mentaire des Monuments Historiques.

The episode was written by co- executive producer Mindy Kaling and directed by Randall Einhorn. \\"The Sting\\" guest stars Timothy Olyphant as Danny Cordray. The series depicts the everyday lives of office employees in the Scranton, Pennsylvania branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. In the episode, a Dunder Mifflin client is stolen by a rival salesman named Danny Cordray (Olyphant), and Michael Scott (Steve Carell), Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson), and Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) decide to set up a sting in order to uncover his sales secret. Meanwhile, Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) starts a band when he learns that one of his old college friends has a successful music career. \\"The Sting\\" is the first episode of the series to feature Olyphant, who appears in a recurring capacity during the seventh season. The episode received largely positive reviews from television critics, many of whom felt that while the main plot was not realistic, it was very humorous. \\"The Sting\\" was viewed by 6.87 million viewers and received a 3.4 rating among adults between the age of 18 and 49, marking a slight drop in the ratings when compared to the previous week. Despite this, the episode ranked second in its timeslot was the highest- rated NBC series of the night that it aired. Synopsis Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) and Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) are sent on assignment to make a sales pitch to a client, and are eager to land the sale. However, Danny Cordray (Timothy Olyphant), a rival paper salesman from the very small Osprey company who steals more potential sales away from Dunder Mifflin than anyone, has also arrived for a sales pitch. Dwight also reveals that Danny had a romantic history with Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) four years previously. Jim and Dwight call in Michael Scott (Steve Carell), who is ecstatic at getting a chance to make a sale, to come and try to save them. The company ends up taking Danny's offer, even after Michael promises at-cost paper sales and weekend delivery. The trio leaves the client's office and head back home, defeated. During a brainstorm session, Michael, Jim, and Dwight decide to set up a sting operation to observe Danny's sales techniques. They set up Meredith Palmer (Kate Flannery) as the CEO of the fictional company Solartech in Dwight's office, fitted with security cameras, and watch from another room. Danny is then sent in to try to make a sale. All starts well until Meredith attempts to seduce him. Dwight and Jim send in Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) to save the sting, but Meredith strong-arms him into submission. After she does the same to Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak), Michael rushes in to call the whole thing off. Danny becomes infuriated and walks off. Michael catches up to him and offers him a job, pointing out that with Sabre's better pricing, he could make more sales as a traveling salesman for them. He accepts the offer, and Michael introduces him as the new salesman to the office. The rest of the sales staff act disrespectful towards him, worrying that Danny will take their clients. Michael tells them how well sales numbers will go up with Danny as a part of the branch, and that he is not going to rescind Danny's job offer just because it makes the other salespeople uncomfortable. Before Dwight leaves for the day, he viciously insults Danny about his alleged mistreatment of Pam and client-stealing past, then immediately welcomes him to the company. Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) starts a band after reading about how well one of his friends is doing in the music business. He manages to get Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) and Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) to join him in writing a song, with Andy singing an anti-war song from the perspective of a little girl in falsetto. The song is poorly received by the rest of the office, specifically having a problem with Andy singing from the girl's point of view, and Andy returns to the drawing board. Seeing that Andy is dejected, Kevin and Darryl offer to stay and jam with him for a little extra time, and the trio come up with a lively song called \\"Bullfrog In Love\\". Production Timothy Olyphant guest starred as Danny Cordray in \\"The Sting\\" \\"The Sting\\" was directed by Randall Einhorn and written by Mindy Kaling, who also plays Kelly Kapoor in the show. It was the first episode to feature Timothy Olyphant in a guest appearance as Danny Cordray, a rival paper salesman. Olyphant would return for the season's Halloween special, \\"Costume Contest\\", and would appear in a deleted scene for Carell's penultimate episode, \\"Michael's Last Dundies\\". Olyphant enjoyed his stint on the show, later telling IGN that filming both \\"The Sting\\" and his scenes for other episodes was \\"a blast\\" and \\"a kick to do\\" because The Office is \\"such a fun show, the nature of the whole thing. The way they do it is just so fun and easy.\\" The Season Seven DVD contains a number of deleted scenes from this episode. Notable cut scenes include Jim and Danny discussing Danny's success at selling his father's restaurant for a large amount of money, Michael expressing his delight at helping Jim and Dwight despite the fact that he is \\"an old man\\", Michael mistaking Danny for a male model, extended scenes of Andy's band, extra footage of Meredith flirting with Danny, Michael remembering that Danny was once a backpack model, and Danny saying that the only reason he will be working at Dunder Mifflin is because \\"they offered [him] a stupid amount of money\\". Cultural references In the cold opening, Oscar shows the office his new bicycle, which Kevin notes is a Lance Armstrong model. Kelly is offended, because she is \\"team Sheryl Crow\\", a reference to the two's engagement and break up. The potential customer that Jim and Dwight are trying to woo shares the same name with famous athlete Steve Nash, and Jim has to explain to Dwight that the famous Nash is a point guard for the Phoenix Suns basketball team. Michael compares the plot to learn Danny's secret to the 1973 film The Sting, which starred Paul Newman and Robert Redford. Kelly notes that Danny reminds her of actor Josh Duhamel. The reason for Andy forming a band is that he discovers that his friend and rival Broccoli Rob (later played in the series by Stephen Colbert) collaborated with Trey Anastasio, the lead singer and songwriter from the jam band Phish, and wrote a song together. This plot device would later be mentioned in the ninth season episode \\"Here Comes Treble\\". Andy's band would become a minor story arc, and would reappear in the season eight episode \\"Pam's Replacement\\". Reception In its original American broadcast on October 21, 2010, \\"The Sting\\" was viewed by an estimated 6.87 million viewers and received a 3.4 rating/9 percent share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49. This means that it was seen by 3.4 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds, and 9 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of the broadcast. The episode's rating dropped 11 percent from the previous episode to its lowest ever fall telecast at the time. The episode ranked second in its timeslot, after an episode of the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) series Grey's Anatomy, and was the highest-rated NBC series of the night. Myles McNutt of The A.V. Club rated the episode with an \\"A\\" grade. He felt the episode was the \\"highlight\\" of the season. McNutt applauded that Michael was portrayed in a way that was neither \\"too dumb or too ignorant\\" and that he was able to have the final moment where he showed that he was a skilled salesman. Despite noting that the sting was not realistic, he further enjoyed that Michael, Dwight, and Jim were allowed to react to the situation rather than becoming part of it. Jason Hughes of AOL's TV Squad gave the episode a positive review and praised the use of Meredith, calling her \\"hilarious and so spot-on\\". Furthermore, he, like McNutt, enjoyed that Michael was portrayed as competent in the end. Hughes also enjoyed the B-story and wrote that \\"it was a sweet moment when Darryl told Andy he didn't have to pay him any more to jam with them\\". Entertainment Weekly's Margaret Lyons wrote that, while \\"its out-and- out silliness wasn't in the supertraditional Office style\\", she \\"totally dug it\\". Furthermore, she praised Kaling's writing, saying \\"Leave it to Mindy Kaling to deliver the best episode of The Office in a long, long time.\\" Alan Sepinwall of HitFix gave the episode a mixed review. He felt the episode \\"was a complete cartoon\\" and also stated \\"It bore very little resemblance to what the show once was\\". Despite this he also stated, that \\"on its own completely absurd level, it worked\\" because it was very humorous; Sepinwall noted that he \\"found [himself] laughing a surprising amount of the time, even more than at previous episodes this season that felt more Office-like\\". Bonnie Stiernberg of Paste magazine awarded the episode an 8.2 rating out of 10, noting that \\"The Office is at its best when it has one foot planted in reality and the other drifting off into the absurd.\\" She also enjoyed that the show illustrated Michael's actual talents as a salesman. Furthermore, Stiernberg felt that Andy's subplot helped balance the \\"silliness\\" of Michael's main plot. Dan Forcella of TV Fanatic awarded the episode four-and-a-half stars out of five and praised Olyphant's acting, writing that he \\"just killed it\\" during his appearance. He also called the entry \\"a big step up from last week\\", largely due to its entertaining main plot and its \\"pleasant\\" B-story.

Written by Justin Spitzer and directed by Dean Holland, the episode aired on NBC in the United States on October 28, 2010. This episode received positive reviews. In the episode, Michael freaks out when Darryl goes over his head by taking an idea to corporate. The employees partake in a Halloween costume contest in the office. Meanwhile, Pam tries to get the truth from Danny about their dating history. Synopsis The office becomes excited over the annual Halloween costume contest, the prize for which is a Scranton-area coupon book. Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez), frustrated that no one else seems to realize what a meager prize a coupon book really is (as it is worth over $15,000 in savings, however the rest of the office thinks that is the actual worth), changes out of his costume and snarkily states that he is dressed up as \\"a rational consumer\\". The significance of this gesture goes over the other workers' heads, and Oscar becomes increasingly embarrassed at being virtually the only person not in costume. Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) persistently begs Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) to wear a matching couples costume of Popeye and Olive Oyl with her, but he refuses as he feels he is too old for costumes. As the day goes on, several people realize their costume might not win, so they leave the office to switch into something more recognizable or provocative. Gabe Lewis (Zach Woods) informs the staff that delivery drivers can now suggest additional products for the customers they deliver to, increasing sales for the company. Michael Scott (Steve Carell) realizes this idea is similar to a suggestion made by Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson), which he had shot down. He now realizes this was a mistake and apologizes to Darryl, and Darryl says he holds no grudge against him. However, Michael feels increasingly uncomfortable at Darryl not receiving credit for his idea, and announces to the entire office that he is going to confront corporate about stealing Darryl's idea. Gabe tells Michael that Darryl actually pitched the idea to him, and has already received credit. New salesman Danny Cordray (Timothy Olyphant) invites everyone to a Halloween party at his bar after work. Almost everyone in the office is aware that Danny and Pam had a two-date fling four years ago. Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) and Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) tell Danny that they are not going to his party because Pam does not want them to, which incites Danny to confront Jim and Pam. They reassure him that Pam does not care if people go to his party, and the three laugh about how their coworkers have been exaggerating the significance of his two dates with Pam; however, it also becomes clear that Pam wants to know exactly why she was rejected. When Jim confronts him, Danny says he never called back because Pam talked about Jim during their dates. Pam reveals she never mentioned Jim, and so Danny reluctantly admits that he found her too \\"dorky.\\" Though Jim is offended, Pam is satisfied at having a reason, and leaves the situation at that. Jim realizes he loves Pam for being so dorky, and comes into the office wearing his Popeye costume and carrying Cece (dressed as Swee'Pea), much to the delight of Pam. Michael is angered that Darryl went over his head, and tries to get Darryl to apologize in front of everyone for 'backstabbing' him. Darryl refuses, criticizing Michael's poor judgment of his idea. Michael changes his costume to Darryl's warehouse uniform, and mocks him. The two bring their argument to Gabe, where Darryl expresses his opinion that Michael has never done anything for him. After some negotiating by Gabe, Darryl and Michael apologize to each other. Darryl wishes he were still operating down in the warehouse, but Andy inspires Darryl to further his career at Dunder Mifflin. They both agree to complain to CEO Jo Bennet if Gabe ever rejects either of their ideas. Oscar is declared the winner of the costume contest. A series of interviews reveal several employees' reasons for voting for Oscar ‚Äì Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling) voted on whom she thought was least likely to win, Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) for the underdog, and Creed Bratton (Creed Bratton) because he thought Oscar was wearing an excellent Edward James Olmos costume. Production \\"Costume Contest\\" was directed by Dean Holland, an editor on the series, and written by Justin Spitzer. Holland also directed the fifth-season episode, \\"The Duel\\". It was the second episode to feature Timothy Olyphant, who was billed as a special guest star, in a guest appearance as Danny Cordray. David Koechner appears as Todd Packer, last seen in the sixth-season episode, \\"St. Patrick's Day\\". With the seventh season of The Office being Carell's last, the writers decided to divide the season into two distinct halves; the first half would \\"celebrate Carell's finale year and highlight different actors on the show\\", whereas the second half would focus on his departure and the search for a new manager. As such, \\"Costume Contest\\" was one of the first episodes of the season to specifically highlight other characters, in this case Robinson's character, Darryl. Within the week of the original air date, Hulu released four deleted scenes from the episode. In the first 87-second clip, Dwight and Michael try to destroy Darryl's idea by having a fake fight which eventually fails. In the second 79-second clip, Dwight kisses up to Darryl in case he is promoted. In the fourth 50-second clip, Toby and Kelly explain why they want the coupon book while Oscar looks for something good in the book.

The house is listed on the (now defunct) Australian Register of the National Estate and is listed on the Municipality of Woollahra local government heritage list. The house is situated in the northern end of the suburbHeritage of Australia, p.2/131 and sold for close to 60 million in 2018, making it one of Australia's most expensive homes at the time. The estate Rona was originally a estate and was sub-leased from Frederick Tooth, a member of the Tooth family of Cranbrook, by Sir Edward Knox, the founder of CSR Limited. It was bought in 1880 by Knox's son, William Knox, and William Oswald Gilchrist. Knox Jnr and his brother, Tom, built Rona and Leura respectively and in 1900 Gilchrist sold to Sir Colin Stephen who built Llanillo. Stephen was Edward William Knox's son-in-law and his daughter, Helen Rutlege, wrote the story of Rona and the Knox family in a book entitled My Grandfather's House. Llanillo has since been demolished and the land sub-divided but Leura still stands with a Victoria Road address. Rona is still set in expansive, though greatly reduced, gardens that have now been redeveloped by Myles Baldwin. Greycliffe House inspired the design of Rona The Rona gate house on Ginahgulla Road The house Rona was designed by G. A. Morell and built in 1883 for Edward William Knox. The design was based on Greycliffe House, another heritage-listed home in Nielsen Park, Vaucluse, New South Wales, that had been the childhood home of Mrs Knox. Like Greycliffe, Rona is a two-storey house in the Victorian Rustic Gothic Revival style and built in Sydney sandstone. The house was severely damaged by fire in 1905 and restored with modifications by the architect William Wardell Jnr. In 1951, the architect John Mansfield removed the large south centre gable. This created an internal courtyard and two apartments for descendants of three generations of the Knox family including Martha Rutledge and her daughter and son-in-law Caroline and David Parker. The Parker children who lived at Rona as children in the later part of the last century included The Hon. Justice Guy Parker and Jocelyn Parker, the wife of Philip Lowe, the current Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, and John Parker. This century, the courtyard has again been roofed, but in glass, and the area is once again enclosed. The stables The stables were built at the same time as the house and in similar style. In 1959 they were converted into a residence by the architect John Amory for a Knox family descendant. The building has now been reunited with the house by the creation of a new driveway and gates from Ginaghulla Road.

Through its subsidiary companies, Deutsche Telekom has operations in around 50 countries worldwide.http://www.telekom.com/company In Germany, Austria, and the Netherlands, employees are represented by trade unions. When Deutsche Telekom purchased VoiceStream Wireless in 2001, the CWA helped the company gain approval for access to the U.S. market, with the expectation that Deutsche Telekom would be open to letting employees freely choose union representation in the United States. The relationship between CWA and T-Mobile US has since eroded. Since it entered the American market in 2001, T-Mobile US has been repeatedly criticized for its employment relations by CWA, ver.di, and other groups. Likewise, American Rights at Work and Human Rights Watch have issued studies of union intolerance at the company‚Äôs facilities. In April 2008, CWA and ver.di formed a joint organization for T-Mobile workers named TU. The new organization was \\"formed with the goal of overcoming the double standard of Deutsche Telekom recognizing labor rights in Germany but ignoring them in the U.S. This new global union is an effective answer to cross-border investment and the globalization of work.\\" When CWA and ver.di created the joint organization, they originally named it ‚ÄúT-Union‚Äù. However, Deutsche Telekom threatened to sue the organizations for trademark infringement, since they had trademarked the concept of branding their services with a leading \\"T-\\" (as they did with the color magenta). So, CWA and ver.di had to rename the union TU for T-Mobile Workers Union. In August, 2013, TU launched a new website that allows workers at T-Mobile and MetroPCS to connect with each other to build strength in their drive for workplace justice and respect.https://www.aflcio.org/index.php/Blog/Organizing-Bargaining/T-Mobile- US-Workers-Unite-for-Respect TU Affiliates Ver.di Ver.di represents 2.3 million workers in Germany, including Deutsche Telekom employees.

Construction Studio 8H was originally built in 1933, at the time of Radio City‚Äôs initial construction. It was intended not only for orchestral performances but also for radio variety programs with large studio audiences. It became the home of Arturo Toscanini's NBC Symphony Orchestra in 1937. At the time of construction, Studio 8H was the world's largest radio studio, feet with a height of three stories, which could house a full orchestra.

They team up and persuade a millionaire to finance them to develop and market the product, while unsavoury elements are keen to steal the formula and try all means to get their hands on it, involving slapstick chases and double-crosses. It then turns out that the miracle fluid is diluted coconut oil, and the genius professor is an escaped lunatic. The millionaire finds himself taking the brunt of the disappointment.

History and description Caerleon is a two-storey Queen Anne home built in 1885. Original plans for the house were drawn up by Sydney architect Harry Kent, but they were reworked extensively by Maurice Adams in London, England. Controversy followed when Kent found that his name was left out altogether when the plans were exhibited in London. Kent nevertheless supervised the construction of the house, which was designed for another member of the Fairfax family, Charles B.Fairfax. The house represents a rich example of Queen Anne elements: red brick walls with stone dressing, terracota shingles, balconies, bay windows, verandahs, leadlight windows and elaborate chimneys. It is said to have been the first Queen Anne home in Australia and set the tone for the Federation Queen Anne homes that were to become so popular.The Federation House, Fraser and Joyce (New Holland Publishers) 2002, p.22 It was sold for $22 million in January, 2008.Sydney Morning Herald, January 25, 2008, p.3 Gallery Image:(1)Caerleon side view-1.jpgSide view of house File:(1)Caerleon.jpgExterior See also * Architecture of Australia * Architecture of Sydney * Federation architecture References Category:New South Wales Heritage Database Category:Houses in Bellevue Hill, New South Wales Category:Houses completed in 1885 Category:1885 establishments in Australia Category:New South Wales places listed on the defunct Register of the National Estate Category:Queen Anne architecture in Australia ","title":"Caerleon, Bellevue Hill"},{"id":"29208665","text":"Ferran Velazco i Querol (born Barcelona, 23 June 1976) is a Spanish rugby union player.

Today Quique's son, Papo Lucca, directs the band.\\"Classic and Future Latin Sounds Along With Glimpses of the Past\\", New York Times, Sep. 12, 2005. The band has stayed active for a remarkable amount of time, recording dozens of albums, including a 55th anniversary album. Singers included Tito G√≥mez. History=Origin The history of La Sonora Ponce√±a is the history of Quique Lucca (December 12, 1912 ‚Äì October 9, 2016), who was born in Yauco, Puerto Rico. In 1928, when he was 16 years old, his family moved to Ponce, Puerto Rico and Quique started to work as an auto mechanic and started playing the guitar. In 1932 he met Ang√©lica Qui√±ones, the future mother of his children, Zulma, Papo and Wanda. In 1944 Quique put together a band called \\"El Conjunto Internacional\\", including three instrumentalists: tumbadora, bong√≥, vocalist Carlos Luis Mart√≠nez and Quique Lucca at the guitar and second voice. Later, Antonio 'Tato' Santaella joined, playing the bong√≥. On 10 April 1946, Enrique Lucca Jr. (\\"Papo\\") was born; he would later become the musical director of \\"La Sonora\\". In fact, in 1951, Papo surprised his father and the other members of the \\"Internacional\\" band when, at only 5 years old, he joined a band practice and started playing the tumbadora on Tito Puente's \\"Ran Kan Kan\\".Biograf√≠a de La Sonora Ponce√±a. Buena Musica. 2013. Retrieved 16 May 2013. Reorganization After the band had been inactive for a year, Quique re-established it in 1954 and renamed it \\"Conjunto Sonora Ponce√±a\\". His childhood friend Antonio \\"Tato\\" Santaella played bajo de caj√≥n. On 20 April of that year the band played at its first official dance. In 1956, Vicentivo Morales, joined the band as its first pianist. Later that year, Quique brought young Papo into the band as a pianist. In November 1957, Papo made its official debut during a dance on the northern shore of the Island. In 1958, La Sonora Ponce√±a recorded its first 78 RPM with Avelino Mu√±oz as pianist. The 78 RPM contained No puede Ser on one side and Tan Linda que Era on the reverse side. Towards the end of 1958, the band went into recording mode and included 12-year-old Papo Lucca. The band included its first official vocalist Charlie Mart√≠nez. Later on, vocalists Felipe and Davilita would also record bolero-mambo themes such as Noche de Locura. In September 1960, the group played in New York City. The group's main attraction was its 12-year-old pianist, Papo Lucca. In 1968 the group started its official recordings on 33 RPM with the song Hacheros Pa' Un Palo. Papo Lucca, playing piano with the Sonora Ponce√±a; his father Quique Lucca stands next to him Retirements In 1974, singer Humberto \\"Tito\\" G√≥mez left the band after 7 years and 6 recordings. Together with Joe Rodr√≠guez and Mickey Ort√≠z, Humberto \\"Tito\\" G√≥mez formed La Terr√≠fica. Likewise, in 1977 Edgardo Morales, who played the timbal left the band after 7 years and 7 recordings and joined El Gran Combo de Puerto Rico. In 1978 singer Luis Guillermo \\"Luigui\\" Texidor left the band after 10 years and 10 recordings to join Bobby Valent√≠n's Orchestra. In 1982 trumpetist Humberto Godineaux left the band after 4 years and 6 recordings. Singer Yolanda Rivera also left the band after 7 years and 8 recordings. In 1985, singer Miguel Ort√≠z retired from the band after 11 years and 12 recordings. On 28 May 1986, the band lost singer Alberto \\"To√±ito\\" Led√©e in a car accident. In 1987, trumpetist Heriberto \\"Ayatollah\\" Santiago also retired having 7 years and 5 recordings to his credit. In July 1989, long-time bass player Antonio \\"Tato\\" Santaella retired after 21 recordings. Tato played without ever using any musical scores, and sang entirely \\"by ear\\". A year later, in 1990, another bass player, Efra√≠n \\"Frao\\" Hern√°ndez retired from the band after 10 years and 7 recordings. In 1990, bong√≥ player Angel Hern√°ndez also retired after 14 years and 13 recordings. In 1991, tumbadora player, Vicente \\"Peque√±o Johnny\\" Rivera, retired after 16 years with the band. He had performed on 15 of the band's recordings. In 1993, long-time trumpeter Ram√≥n \\"Tony El Cordov√©s\\" Rodr√≠guez retired after 24 recordings. This was followed by the retirement of trumpeter Freddie Del Valle, who had played with the band for 6 years and had participated in 5 recordings. Internationalization In 1993, the band played at the Magno Orchestra Festival in Barranquilla, Colombia. The band was awarded the ‚ÄúCongo de Oro‚Äù award, given to the best international band. And in October 1994, Sonora Ponce√±a celebrated its 40th anniversary with a festival at Estadio Juan Ram√≥n Loubriel in Bayam√≥n, Puerto Rico. The band would later also play at the Madison Square Garden to bring its celebration to the United States. In 1995, the band did a reunion recording with Luis Guillermo \\"Luigi\\" Texidor and Yolanda Rivera who had retired 19 and 14 years earlier, respectively. That same year, they sang in Paris, France, and at the Desfile de la Hispanidad (Hispanic Parade) in Zaragoza, Spain. In 1996 the band played for the first time in Mexico at the Boca del R√≠o, Veracruz, Mexico, carnival. Anniversary concerts In 2000, Sonora Ponce√±a celebrated its 45th anniversary at the Tito Puente Amphitheater at the Centro de Bellas Artes in San Juan, Puerto Rico and at the Teatro La Perla in Ponce. They also played in Caracas, Venezuela as part of this 45th anniversary celebration. In the years following 2000, La Sonora Ponce√±a participated in a large number of events throughout Puerto Rico, including Fiestas Patronales, private parties, graduation parties, and corporate Christmas and holiday parties. In the following years, the band also made presentations in Orlando, Jacksonville, Miami, Washington, Connecticut, Philadelphia, Chicago, New Jersey, Panam√°, Per√∫, England, Switzerland and Italy. For its 50th anniversary (2004), the band played at Coliseo Rub√©n Rodr√≠guez, in Bayam√≥n, Puerto Rico. The 12,000 spectators made the show a complete sellout on its presentation day, February 21.

Background After nearly eight years had passed from the prior album Hialeah Pink, which Alex McManus spent working with several other indie acts, he released The War of the Bruces. These songs are a culmination of the years he spent as a supporting musician. Style The album is primarily guitar driven, but there are instrumental appearances of the banjo, sparse horn sections, and minimal use of keyboards layering the compositions; most are played by McManus, including the fiddle.Davis, p. 133. The lyrics have been described as abstract, and at times metaphorical, and the music as fluid, atmospheric. Reception The War of the Bruces received somewhat positive reviews; Tim McMahon stated that \\"McManus' dust-covered melodies are a road best taken\\". However, it took one critic several listens in order to enjoy it. The album appeared on the CMJ music charts on December 2, 2002 at No. 174.CMJ New Music Report (December 2), p. 13.

The conflict had both political and regional dimensions, as it pitted the Roumeliotes (the people of Continental Greece) and the Islanders (the shipowners, especially from Hydra island), against the Peloponnesians or Moreotes. It divided the young nation, and seriously weakened the military preparedness of the Greek forces in the face of the oncoming Egyptian intervention in the conflict. Background Theodoros Kolokotronis, one of the main military leaders, had the Peloponnese as his powerbase. By the end of March 1821, Peloponnese was in open revolt against the Ottoman Empire and by October 1821 the Greeks under Theodoros Kolokotronis had already captured Kalamata and Tripolitsa. After the fall of Kalamata, the Messenian Senate, the first of the Greeks' local governing councils, held its inaugural session. At almost the same time, the Achean Directorate was summoned in Patras. With the initiative of the Messenian Senate, a Peloponnesian assembly convened, and elected on May 26 a Senate. Assemblies convened also in Central Greece (November 1821) under the leadership of two Phanariots: Alexandros Mavrokordatos in the western part, and Theodoros Negris in the eastern part. These assemblies adopted two local statutes, the Charter of Western Continental Greece and the Legal Order of Eastern Continental Greece. The statutes provided for the creation of two local administrative organs in Central Greece, an Areopagus in the east, and a Senate in the west.Koliopoulos & Veremis, Greece: the Modern Sequel, pp. 14-17. * Papageorgiou, \\"First Year of Freedom\\", pp. 67-70. The three local statutes were recognized by the First National Assembly, but were later dissolved by the Second National Assembly.Koliopoulos & Veremis, Greece: the Modern Sequel, pp. 19-20. * Theodoridis, \\"A Modern State\\", pp. 129-130. The First National Assembly was formed at Epidaurus in late December 1821, consisted almost exclusively of Peloponnesian notables. The Assembly composed the first Greek Constitution and appointed the members of an executive and a legislative body that were to govern the liberated territories. Mavrokordatos saved the office of president of the executive for himself, while Ypsilantis, who had called for the Assembly, was elected president of the legislative body, a place of no significance.Dakin, The Greek Struggle for independence, pp. 87-9. Military leaders and representative of Filiki Eteria were marginalized, but gradually Kolokotronis' political influence grew, and he soon managed to control, along with the captains he influenced, the Peloponnesian Senate, which was not dissolved by the National Assembly. The Senate actually governed Peloponnese, while the central government was too weak to exercise its power. Seeing the impasse and the growing power of the Peloponnesian captains, Mavrokordatos and the Hydriots proposed the dissolution of the Senate and its incorporation into the National Assembly. Mavromichalis accepted the proposal, but the military leaders rejected it. After the rejection of the proposal, the central administration tried to marginalize Kolokotronis who controlled the fort of Nafplion. In November 1822, the central administration promulgated the law for the election of representative for the new National Assembly, but Kolokotronis defied the law, and declared that Peloponnese will organize its own assembly for the elections of the new members of the Senate.Rotzokos, \\"Civil Wars\\", 143-148 First civil war The provisional government decided that the National Assembly would take place in Nafplio, and asked Kolokotronis to return the fort to the government. Kolokotronis refused, and proposed that the Assembly take place in Nafplion, while the city remained under his control. His stance divided his supporters and weakened him politically. Most of the members of the Peloponnesian Senate obeyed the decisions of the government, and the captains were forced to negotiate their participation in the Assembly. Finally, the Second National Assembly was gathered in March 1823 in Astros. Central governance was strengthened at the expense of regional bodies, a new constitution was voted, and new members were elected for the executive and legislative bodies.Rotzokos, \\"Civil Wars\\", 148-151 Trying to coax the military leaders, the central administration proposed to Kolokotronis to participate in the executive body as vice-president. Kolokotronis accepted, but his actions caused a serious crisis when he prevented Mavrokordatos, who had been elected president of the legislative body, from assuming his position. His attitude towards Mavrokordatos caused the rage of the members of the legislative body, which was controlled by the Roumeliotes and the Hydriots. Both Kolokotronis and his president in the executive, Petros Mavromichalis, were harshly criticized by the members of the legislative body.Rotzokos, \\"Civil Wars\\", 152-154 The crisis culminated when the legislative overturned the executive and dismissed its members. Kolokotronis and most of the Peloponnesian notables and captains supported Mavromichalis, who remained president of his executive in Tripolitsa. However, a second executive, supported by the islanders, the Roumeliotes, some Achaean notables--Andreas Zaimis and Andreas Londos were the most prominent--and others, such as Papaflessas, was formed at Kranidi with Kountouriotis as president. The war started in early March 1824, when the government asked Panos Kolokotronis to surrender Nafplion. Panos denied and the government decided to besiege the city. On 22 March 1824, the forces of the new executive besieged Tripolitsa, and after two weeks of fighting an agreement was reached between Kolokotronis, from the one side, and Londos and Zaimis, from the other. The old executive was finally dissolved, and Kolokotronis fled the city. On 22 May the first phase of the civil war officially ended. Most members of the new executive however wanted a complete victory over their opponents, and were thus displeased by the moderate terms of the agreement that Londos and Zaimis brokered. Kolokotronis and Mavromichalis retreated, but they intended to regroup their forces and launch a new offensive. Additionally, Panos Kolokotronis agreed to surrender Nafplion only to Londos and Zaimis, an arrangement which again resulted in the intensification of the mistrust of the government towards the two Achaean notables, who were still allies of the central administration.Dimitropoulos, Theodoros Kolokotronis, 79-81 * Rotzokos, \\"Civil Wars\\", 154-161 Second civil war Georgios Kountouriotis During this period the two first instalments of the English loan had arrived, an event which strengthened the position of the government; but the infighting was not yet over. Zaimis and the other Peloponnesians who supported Kountouriotis came into conflict with the executive body when they were excluded from most government posts after the elections of 3 October 1824. Prominent persons from both sides proposed negotiations and the convening of a new National Assembly, but most members of the executive (especially Papaflessas and Ioannis Kolettis) wished the complete subjugation of the Peloponnesians. The military conflict resumed when Kolokotronis roused the residents of Tripolitsa against the local tax collectors of the government. Papaflessas and Yannis Makriyannis failed to suppress the rebellion, which spread throughout the Peloponnese, but neither Kolokotronis nor Londos or Zaimis attempted to occupy Tripolitsa. Kolokotronis remained inactive for some period because of an additional reason: he could not overcome the death of his son, Panos, killed by his opponents. While the Peloponnesians were undecided about their further moves, the government regrouped its armies, which now consisted mainly of Roumeliotes and Souliots, several of whom previously served the Peloponnesians. The plan of the government was implemented by Kolettis, who ordered two bodies of Roumeliotes and Souliots to invade the Peloponnese. On 23 November, the first of these bodies under Gouras occupied Corinth and raided the province. The second body under Georgios Karaiskakis, Kitsos Tzavelas and others, attacked in Achaea Londos and Zaimis, who retreated and then fled to Kalamos. In January 1825, a Roumeliote force, led by Kolettis himself, raided once again Peloponnese, and arrested Kolokotronis, Deligiannis' family and others. The next month Mavrokordatos assumed the position of the president of the executive. In May 1825, under the pressure of the Egyptian intervention of Ibrahim Pasha, those imprisoned were released and granted amnesty.Dimitropoulos, Theodoros Kolokotronis, 79-81 * Rotzokos, \\"Civil Wars\\", 164-170.

Swifts is a rare survivor of a group of similar grand private residences sited on the southern shore of Sydney Harbour. It is described by the Australian Heritage Council as \\"perhaps the grandest house remaining in Sydney\\". Swifts was listed on the Register of the National Estate on 21 October 1980, and the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999. The motto Perseverantia Palmam Obtinebit, being Latin for \\"perseverance gains the prize\\", is carved into the eastern fa√ßade of Swifts and seems to sum up the home as well as the lives of those who have lived in it. Designed by G. A. Morrell, Swifts was built in stages from around 1873 to 1882 by Sir Robert Lucas Lucas-Tooth, the distinguished Australian brewer. In the 1880s, Sir Robert Lucas-Tooth had the house significantly remodelled in the style and likeness of his family home, Great Swifts Manor in Cranbrook, Kent. The house was subsequently purchased by Edmund Resch, also a brewer, and eventually bequeathed by his son Edmund Resch Jr to the Roman Catholic Church upon his death in 1963. In 1997, Swifts was acquired by the Moran family and, in what saved the home from a state of dereliction and possible destruction, underwent total restoration and renovation. Dr Shane Moran is the current owner. History=Yarranabbe Darling Point is located within the area of the Cadigal people, one of the Aboriginal clans of the Sydney region, and was known from at least 1795 as \\"Yarranabbe\\". The plan of land for sale at Darling Point in 1856 cites the Indigenous name for the point, and the name is listed in the Town and Country Journal's 'Aboriginal names of places' of 1878. Mrs Darling's Point By the 1830s the vast majority of the harbour fronting land east of Darling Point was held by a small number of landholders, being principally the Cooper and Wentworth families, while at Double Bay, a government village had been reserved. At Darling Point, Governor Darling reserved the promontory for sale in 1831 at the suggestion of the Surveyor General, Thomas Mitchell. The area was subsequently surveyed into large villa allotments and referred to the promontory as 'Mrs Darling's Point' in respect to Eliza Darling, the wife of the Governor. However, the \\"Mrs\\" was dropped over time. Purchase by Thomas Barker of the Villa Grants on Mrs Darling's Point The first auction on the northern part of the promontory came on 11 October 1833 under the direction of Governor Darling's successor, Governor Bourke. At the sale, nine allotments varying in area between were offered. The reserve price per acre was A¬£10 but the average price actually paid was much higher at ¬£34. Swifts is located on allotment four which was originally in size when it was purchased by Thomas Barker in November 1833. Barker also purchased the adjoining allotment of at the same time. The total purchase price for the was ¬£573.Broomham, R, 'Darling Point ‚Äì Thematic History' (2002) prepared for Woollahra Council Subdivision of the villa grants With no development evidently having occurred, Barker's Darling Point grant was soon sold in 1835 to Thomas Icely. Icely had also acquired the neighbouring allotment of Lindesay at the time. Icely had been settled in the colony since 1822 and after an early dalliance in trading, went into pastoralism. The Darling Point grant, arguably the most favourably sited and extensive on the promontory, remained vacant. In the same year the Kent Brewery was opened on Parramatta Road at Blackwattle Bay. It was founded by John Tooth and his brother-in-law, Charles Newnham. Meanwhile, Barker's two grants, within which Swifts is sited, had been purchased in 1838 by Thomas Urmson Ryder, a partner in the mercantile company Aspinall, Brown & Co. Ryder had the land subdivided into 14 lots suitable for villas and put up for auction in April 1840 as the DeLamere Estate, which netted some ¬£13,531.Bemi, PL, 'Sketch of Delamere Estate' (1840) State Library of NSW, ZM2/811.18114/1840/3 With the northernmost allotments comprising the site of the future Swifts, ownership changed hands successively during the 1840s and 1850s through conveyance, mortgage or trusteeship, but no development ensued. During this time John Tooth was declared bankrupt and the Kent Brewery was leased to his nephews, brothers Robert and Edwin Tooth. Subsequently, in 1844, Robert Lucas Tooth was born to Edwin Tooth. After Frederick, the youngest brother, joined the partnership in 1853, the company traded as R.E. & F. Tooth. In 1855, Edwin Tooth returned to England with his family and remained there until his death. Robert Tooth, Edwin's eldest son, returned to Sydney to join the family brewery in 1863, after having spent his formative years in England and completing his education at Eton. During that year Edmund Resch also migrated to Australia from Germany. Development of Swifts by the Tooth Family: 1872‚Äì1900 Swifts front gate, . Sir Robert Lucas Lucas-Tooth, . In 1869 the Darling Point property was transferred by means of mortgage to Francis Mitchell. Mitchell's professional background was in shipping, being for many years in business with Alexander Berry and Edward Wollstonecraft, and he was the senior partner of Messrs Mitchell & Co., ship chandlers and ship owners. Mitchell's business dealings had brought him into contact with Robert Tooth in 1850, one of the partners in the Kent Brewery owned by the Tooth family. Shortly before his death, Mitchell sold the property in around 1872 to Tooth's nephew, Robert Lucas Tooth. The Sands Directory of 1873 already lists Robert Tooth as being the occupier of the Darling Point site. Tooth was subsequently created a baronet in 1906 and was given a Royal licence to assume the name and arms of Lucas-Tooth. From that time he became known as Sir Robert Lucas Lucas- Tooth. Sir Robert Lucas-Tooth and family posing for a photograph at Swifts, = Original construction: c1873‚Äì1882 = With ownership of the site from at least 1872, the original plain two-storey portion of Swifts was under construction from c.1873‚Äì1875. The revised plans, including the sandstone tower and castellation, as well as other significant extensions, would seem to have been completed in at least 1877. Beatrice Maude, the daughter of Sir Robert Lucas-Tooth and Helen Tooth, laid one of the foundation stones for the remodelling of Swifts on 18 March 1876. The silver trowel was retained by Tooth & Co Ltd and later donated to the Powerhouse Museum in Sydney. The original 1874‚Äì1875 house was modelled on the family home in Cranbrook, Kent named \\"Great Swifts\\". =Expansion: 1882‚Äì1900= The 1880s was a boom period throughout the Australian colonies as money from English banks poured in to fuel expansion. The brewery industry at this time also experienced marked growth, with the number of breweries in the state peaking at an all-time high during the 1880s. In Sir Robert Lucas-Tooth's personal life, his stature in colonial society had grown through entering the Parliament of New South Wales in 1880, representing the seat of Monaro in the Legislative Assembly. In 1882, the prominent French-born Sydney architect Gustavus Alphonse Morrell was engaged by Sir Robert Lucas-Tooth to expand Swifts. The drawings were prepared by J. H. Harvey. Morrell's design for Swifts drew on Sydney's Government House in matters such as sandstone masonry fa√ßades, castellations and tower, the long arcade and porte-coch√®re. In planning the house, Morrell provided a mansion which was as up-to-date as any to be found in England. It was built at a time when servants were mandatory in any household of social status, with cook, kitchen and house maids, butler and footmen, and the management of the grounds and stables required gardeners, coachmen, and grooms. In 1888, Tooth & Co Ltd was formed and Sir Robert Lucas-Tooth was managing director to 1889. Sir Robert Lucas-Tooth and his family then left Sydney in 1889 for England with the remodelled house having only recently been completed. He did, however, make frequent visits to Australia. There is also record of Mr Tooth holidaying at Aldourie Castle, a 7,000 acre estate on the southern banks of Loch Ness in Inverness, Scotland in the summer and autumn months of 1891. Sir Robert Lucas-Tooth was invited to contest one of the northern seats in the United Kingdom's House of Commons in the early 1890s and seems to have used Swifts as a base during his frequent visits back to Sydney. Swifts was leased to the lawyer Henry Harris between 1892 and 1897. In January 1896, a burglary was committed at Swifts when thieves prised open one of the windows next to the main entrance and took property, including jewellery and other portable items to the value of ¬£40. Ernest Burns and John Smith were later found guilty of the theft. Purchase of Swifts by the Resch family: 1900‚Äì64Edmund Resch Sr: 1900‚Äì28= Edmund Resch Sr In 1900 Swifts was purchased by the German emigrant brewer, Edmund Resch, born in Bavaria in 1847 and who arrived in Australia in 1863 to seek his fortune on the goldfields of Victoria. During the 1870s, Edmund entered into partnership with his younger brother Richard in opening a cordial and aerated water factory. Edmund opened the Lion Brewery in Wilcannia in 1879. Over the next few decades, Edmund and his brothers, Emil and Richard, opened other branches of the Lion Brewery in the region. The partnership dissolved in 1885, with Edmund retaining the Wilcannia operation. Meanwhile, Emil went on to establish Carlton & United Breweries with others. In 1900, Resch, who had built a Sydney brewing operation in the late 1890s, purchased Swifts. In June 1900, for reasons unknown, the property title was transferred from Edmund to his wife, Carolina, only to be transferred back to Edmund in October of that year. In Resch's ownership, the alterations were confined to some interior redecorating and a tennis court, suggesting Resch was quite content with what they had received courtesy of his business rival, Sir Robert Lucas-Tooth. Aerial view of Swifts . During the First World War, when anti-German sentiment was rife throughout the country, Edmund contributed generously to the war effort and made up the difference in pay for about sixty employees who had enlisted. In 1909, Edmund and Carolina Resch left for Europe for five years, only to return in 1914. During this time Swifts remained unoccupied apart from the Resch's servants. In 1915, Sir Robert Lucas-Tooth died at his English estate Holme Lacy. The Sydney Morning Herald reported that Sir Robert Lucas-Tooth's last words were: \\"I would like my work to go on.\\" Throughout Australia during the First World War the internment of German nationals was common and there was animosity towards anyone of German origin, including the Resch family. In an editorial on 4 March 1916 the Mirror of Australia stated, in a page three editorial, that \\"The Resch family live at 'Swifts' Darling Point, Sydney, a house which has a commanding view over Sydney Harbor, and could, if so-desired, be easily used for purposes inimical to this country. No German should be permitted to occupy such a residence\\". Edmund Resch evaded such formal action until November 1917, when Resch was arrested for an 'indiscretion' and interned at Holsworthy Internment Camp for a period of four months until, due to ill health he was transferred back to Swifts where he remained under house arrest, with a guard to ensure he could not leave or receive visitors, until the end of the war. According to reports, the indiscretion involved the flying of a German flag atop Swifts. Edmund Resch died at Swifts on 22 May 1923. Probate of his estate was sworn at ¬£316,828. By April 1924, property title was transferred to Edmund Resch Jr and Arnold Resch as joint tenants. =Edmund Resch Jr and Arnold Resch: 1929‚Äì63= Edmund Jr and Arnold Resch ‚Äì Brewery Directors Associated with Edmund Resch Snr in his business were his two sons Edmund Jr (born 1880) and Arnold Gottfried (born 1881). They were educated at the Sydney Church of England Grammar School (Shore School) in North Sydney and Scotch College, Melbourne. Edmund Resch Jr married Florence Mabel Bennett in 1927 and they made Swifts their home until they died (Florence in 1959 and Edmund Resch Jr in 1963). In September 1925 Arnold Resch, who regularly appeared in the social pages of Sydney's newspapers, was the defendant in a sensational ¬£25,000 \\"Breach of Promise\\" legal action against him by Madame Andre Vacher Lauzanne, a so-called French beauty who was the proprietor of \\"an exclusive Sydney salon\\". This was a highly publicised legal case resulting from the alleged failure to proceed with the matrimonial plans. It was reported that the case \\"was a cause celebre that rocked Sydney and sent the circulations of the evening press soaring to record heights for several weeks\\". The salaciousness of the Lauzanne vs Resch case and the notoriety of the defendant became the subject of a black and white short filmhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QURBKiVNpNs which was a huge hit in cinemas. Following settlement of the Supreme Court of New South Wales legal action, in February 1926 Arnold Resch (then 46 years old) married 21-year-old Tottie (n√©e Dennis) in a private (\\"doors locked\\") service at St Marks Church, Darling Point, which was followed by a reception at the Astor apartments in Macquarie Street. He subsequently purchased the property of Belhaven in Victoria Road Bellevue Hill. In 1929, the Resch brewery was acquired by Tooth & Co Ltd with the issue of ¬£1,250,000 shares to Edmund Resch Jr and Arnold Resch. The Reschs gave their 500 former employees a gift of ¬£30,000 to be split amongst them, which was very well received. In August 1929, an unknown assailant (believed to have been a disgruntled Resch's employee opposing the brewery merger) set off dynamite at part of the wall surrounding Swifts. The incident attracted widespread press attention, with the Daily Telegraph reporting it as an \\"Attempt to Blow Up Darling Point Home ‚Äì Terrific Explosion Tears Hole in Wall Round Edmund Resch's Mansion\\". On Carolina's death at Swifts in 1927, the Resch family brewing empire in New South Wales quickly unravelled as the two sons disagreed over the future direction of the company and of Swifts. Swifts was placed on the market in 1928 owing to the family dispute. In February, the brothers appeared in the Supreme Court of New South Wales, before Chief Justice Harvey, to divide their father's estate and to determine the future ownership of Swifts. In October the \\"Grand Old Resch Home\\" was sold at public auction to Edmund Resch Jr. Arnold Resch transferred his undivided moiety in Swifts to Edmund Resch Jr. Arnold Resch retired from the brewery business in 1930. Due to his concerns about the high rate of taxation in New South Wales, on 11 March 1936 Arnold Resch farewelled Australia (aboard the new Orient steam liner the Orion) for Jersey in the Channel Islands together with his wife, Tottie Resch and daughter Vera Caroline (later Le Cras). Following the German occupation of the Channel Islands from 30 June 1940, although an Australian citizen Arnold Resch was removed from his family and the Jersey home that he had acquired, being a grand chateau on 22 acres with orchard and gardens, and was repatriated to Germany where it is believed he died in 1942. In August 1935 Edmund Resch Jr undertook alterations to improve the living and working conditions of his staff and repair the wall. He commissioned plans by architects Robertson & Marks for new laundries and the gardener's compound. In addition, concrete was placed over the carriage drive and garden paths. The changes made for the servants from the original Tooth-era structures reveal the general employment circumstances of domestic staff in the inter-war era with their diminishing numbers limiting employers' opportunities for engaging and retaining reliable staff. Edmund Resch Jr also redecorated the interiors of the main house in the late 1920s, with much of the heavy flock wallpaper still in situ by the 1990s. Further plans were prepared by architects Robertson & Marks for the retaining wall, lavatory and manure bins. During this period the house continued to feature prominently in pop culture with Women's Weekly running the occasional article of the intimate jottings of tennis parties and balls at the \\"castle- like home of Mrs Edmund Resch, Darling Point\\". =Swifts during World War II: Hospital for Wounded Soldiers= right Following the outbreak of the Second World War, based on information from unnamed sources Edmund Resch Jnr was investigated and secretly monitored by Australian Military Police Intelligence. During 1942 there were suspicions of the Reschs engaging in subversive activities, which included making radio transmissions to Germany. These suspicions were never founded, and seem to have been based on anti- German sentiments arising from his name and the fact that he did not associate with his Darling Point neighbours. Edmund Resch Jr was also accused in Parliament of hoarding petrol in the newly installed underground fuel tanks at Swifts. Rather than aiding the German war effort, during the Second World War the Reschs placed parts of Swifts at the disposal of the local Civilian Aid Service to be used as a rest centre for wounded soldiers. On 26 September 1942 parts of the house were officially opened as The Swifts Rest Centre by the Minister for Labor and Social Services, Mr Hamilton Knight, with a staff of twenty carers including three trained nurses. On 17 September 1942, in an article entitled \\"Ballroom Transformed into Civilian Aid Centre\\", the Daily Telegraph reported that \\"the huge ballroom will accommodate more than 100 people in an emergency\\" and \\"we also have the use of two additional rooms for treatment of shock patients\\", including \\"bomb-shocked\\" troops, and was also used by the local Darling Point war effort volunteers as a centre for knitting and sewing quilts and clothing for the Red Cross. =Death of Edmund Resch Jr= Edmund Resch Jr died at Swifts in November 1963 and left a personal fortune of ¬£6.5 million, at that time being the largest estate ever lodged for probate in Australia. Resch had no children with his late wife Florence Bennett, he was extremely generous to his sister-in-law Clara May Bennett (Duff) and her children who lived with him at Swifts he also had chauffeur and staff of five. Pursuant to his will, he left two-thirds of his estate, including the ¬£253,000 Swifts property, to the Sisters of Charity and the Roman Catholic Church. The bequest was for a period of 200 years so long as the Sisters conducted St Vincent's Private Hospital, Darlinghurst. Resch was a Lutheran but raised as an Anglican so the bequest was unusual in that context but understandable in light of both the fact that his late wife Florence had been a Catholic.Clive Lucas, Stapleton and Partners, 'Swifts: Conservation Analysis and Conservation Guidelines', September 1995 With the proceeds of the bequest the Sisters of Charity constructed the new St Vincent's Private Hospital, , Sydney, which was completed in 1976 and at that time was the most expensive private hospital built in Australia. Bequest of Swifts to the Catholic Church: 1964‚Äì86 The next several decades of Swifts as a residence in the mid-twentieth century were associated with it being the home of the Cardinals of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Sydney. In the early stages of the Church's residence the land was subdivided into one lot containing the gardener's house (originally known as 'The Bungalow') and another lot comprising the main house, other outbuildings and grounds. The Bungalow was held in trust by The Perpetual Trustee Company Ltd with the title intended to revert to the Catholic Church on the death of the Resch's gardener. Some alterations were made to the house for the Catholic Church by architects S. G. Hirst & Kennedy. The former ballroom was converted for use as a chapel-of-ease (named St Edmunds in honour of Edmund Resch Jr) that seated 200 and had standing room for about 60 people. Alterations were made to improve services in 1965 and some redecoration but throughout this period the furniture appears to have changed little from what the Resch family had left. That same year, 1964, Cardinal Gilroy moved into Swifts as the official residence of the Archbishop of Sydney. During the first-ever Papal visit to Australia in 1970, Pope Paul VI was accommodated at Swifts as the guest of Cardinal Gilroy. Pope John Paul II also stayed at Swifts during his 1986 visit (hosted by Cardinal Clancy). Resch's final testament effectively preserved Swifts and its grounds from demolition and subdivision at a time when most grand houses in Darling Point were being demolished for high-rise home unit developments. The conditional gift to the Church removed both the possibility of sale and demolition for 20 years after Edmund Resch Jr's death. In 1967, Vera Le Cras, the daughter of Arnold and Tottie Resch, undertook a protracted legal battle in the Supreme Court of New South Wales, and later before the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in London, to (unsuccessfully) argue that Edmund Resch Jr's bequest of two-thirds of the residuary estate to the Sisters of Charity to build a private hospital (St Vincent's Private Hospital) was not a valid charitable gift, and the estate should therefore have passed to her as next of kin. Upon his death in 1970, Cardinal Gilroy was succeeded by Cardinal James Darcy Freeman, who also used Swifts as the official residence of the Archbishop of Sydney. Cardinal Freeman was one of Cardinal Gilroy's prot√©g√©s, having served many years as his private secretary, and continued his predecessor's residence in, and use of, Swifts. Cardinal Freeman's use of Swifts was the longest of the three cardinals. Freeman, on his death in 1983, in turn was succeeded by his prot√©g√©, Cardinal Edward Bede Clancy who also resided in Swifts. Until 1983 the house and grounds had been essentially the private domain of the Tooth and Resch families and the Catholic Church hierarchy, with use of the chapel for masses and weddings. The future premier of New South Wales, The Hon. Bob Carr, was married to Helena John there in 1973. Some interest in the property was elicited by the press in the early 1960s as the details of Edmund Resch Jr's bequest to the Catholic Church became public. This intensified in the 1980s when the future was debated and discussed by government and the general public. =Swifts becomes heritage- listed: 1983‚Äì84= By early 1983 the NSW Heritage Council proposed to place a permanent conservation order on the property under the Heritage Act 1977 (NSW).An Inquiry Pursuant to Section 41 of the Heritage Act 1977, into Objections to the Making of a Permanent Conservation Order in Respect of the Building and Site Known as the 'Swifts', 68 Darling Point Road, Darling Point, Woollahra. Report to the Honourable Eric Bedford, Minister for Planning and Environment, December 1983, p 55. Faced with objections by the Catholic Church a Commission of Inquiry was initiated in August 1983. The Church's final view was that listing should not include the western portion of the grounds. Opposing the Church was a plethora of witnesses and the NSW Heritage Council's own in-house heritage experts who collectively drew attention to the architectural, historic and landscape values of the property as a late Victorian harbour-side mansion. A permanent conservation order, made under the Heritage Act 1977, was placed on the property in April 1984. Swifts is now listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register. Swifts falls into disrepair: 1986‚Äì97 Aerial photograph of Swifts in a state of disrepair In 1986 the property was transferred for a reputed $9 million from the Roman Catholic Church to Minjar Holdings Pty Ltd, the family company of horse trainer and investor Carl Spies. On the same day Minjar Holdings executed a mortgage for $5 million back to the Catholic Church. The sale price was the highest for a residence ever paid in Australia up to that time.Sydney Morning Herald, 17 April 1986 By the early 1990s, the boom of the 1980s had turned to bust, with many investors facing financial ruin. Spies was pursued through the Supreme Court of New South Wales for non-payment of mortgage repayments owed to a number of mortgagees, including the Catholic Church. In 1990 the Spies were evicted by order of the Supreme Court and 450 pieces of furniture were sold at auction in October 1992. Throughout this period Swifts fell into disrepair. Substantial parts of the exterior sandstone walls of the house and gardens, as well as the roofing, become seriously dilapidated. The leaking roof, including a fully collapsed part of it above the main staircase, caused significant damage to the already neglected interiors. With Swifts facing serious and permanent destruction, the NSW Heritage Council, Woollahra Municipal Council and local residents became involved in opposing the redevelopment of the estate. Swifts was eventually placed on the market by St George Bank Ltd as the mortgagee-in-possession for sale by tender in late 1996, and again in mid-1997 for sale by public auction. No sale was recorded at the auction. Purchase and restoration by the Moran Family: 1997‚Äìpresent Scaffolding erected around Swifts during the restoration In April 1997, Swifts was purchased by the Moran family, operators of private health and aged care facilities, for a reputed $12 million. The Moran family engaged the experienced conservation and heritage architect Clive Lucas of Clive Lucas, Stapleton & Partners to take on the mammoth task of restoring the derelict house. This involved extensive stone and roofing reconstruction, repairing the collapsed ceilings and restoration of the interior paintwork. Drawing on the expertise of builders and decorators skilled in traditional techniques, the restoration of Swifts, undertaken between 1997 and 2012, was probably the largest and most expensive of its type for private family use in Sydney. The restoration of Swifts in its historical veracity (inclusive of furniture and furnishing) and scale of restoration has precedents only in the projects by the National Trust of Australia and Historic Houses Trust undertaken at public expense for the benefit of the community of New South Wales. The original Conservation Analysis and Conservation Guidelines report for Swifts noted the vast size, quality of craftsmanship and the intricacy of planning illustrating the complex arrangements required for masters and servants in the late nineteenth century. This has not been lost in the restoration, and the house retains its major reception rooms, entrance hall, drawing room, morning room, smoking room, dining room, and complement of service rooms, kitchen scullery, pantry, butlers' rooms, silver safe, store, wine cellar, housemaid's room, linen room, servants' bedrooms and common areas. Outside there are still the meat rooms, dairy and laundry, and the original stable, double carriage house and tack room.Clive Lucas, Stapleton & Partnersdate=1994title=Swifts, Darling Point Road, Darling Point, Sydney, Conservation Analysis and Conservation Guidelines Final Report A stonemason carefully repairs the Sydney sandstone tower of Swifts c1998 The restoration of Swifts, undertaken with NSW Heritage Council's approval, emphasised the original 1870s Tooth-period of ownership over the later Resch family era. This was due in part to the high rate of survival of evidence for the decorative paint finishes under the twentieth century accretions and the photographic record of the principal rooms made around 1900. The house has become a form of homage to both High Victorian good taste and Sir Robert Lucas-Tooth. The restoration of Swifts provided valuable new evidence for the lifestyle of the master and servants in the late nineteenth century, in particular, the quality and range of decorative wall finishes of the principal rooms and fittings of the servants' service areas. There is insight in the preference for Oriental exoticism in the women's boudoir (or Moorish smoking room) and the preference for particular classical composers (in the ballroom).\\"The Swifts, 68 Darling Point Rd, Darling Point, NSW, Australia (Place ID 2577)\\". Australian Heritage Database. Department of the Environment. Retrieved 12 August 2018 Swifts is considered one of the most detailed Victorian interiors in Sydney and the Moorish smoking room is believed to be unique in Australia. Halfway through some of the interior restoration works in 1998, a tornado swept along the Darling Point ridge destroying much of the restored roofing and decorative painting, both of which had to be redone. Restoration of the grounds was also carried out with the assistance of Sydney-based architect and historian Dr James Broadbent. Swifts Mansion in its current restored form In 2013, Dr Shane Moran bought out the last remaining Moran family interests in the property and became the sole proprietor of Swifts. Dr Moran and his wife Penelope (n√©e Dunbar) were married in 1998 at St Mark's Church, Darling Point, with their reception held in the then partly renovated Swifts' grounds and ballroom. Dr Moran is a descendant of Thomas Barker who acquired the original land grant upon which Swifts was built in 1833. Throughout his ownership, Dr Moran has continued to undertake extensive restoration works on Swifts. The works have included the addition of a new conservatory off the service wing and the construction of a swimming pool. Extensive works to the grounds and gardens were also undertaken. Sir Robert Lucas-Tooth's desire for his \\"work to go on\\" was not in vain. He has also been involved in the restoration of another important national and state heritage property, the 1840s Darling House, The Rocks. Heritage and cultural significance of Swifts=Heritage significance In December 2012, Swifts was awarded the Lachlan Macquarie Award for Heritage by the Australian Institute of Architects for the finest restoration project in Australia. Swifts is significant as a unique Australian translation of a Gothic or Old English style upper-middle class country house of the late nineteenth century picturesquely perched at the tip of Darling Point on Sydney Harbour. The house is impressive for its scale and use of sandstone masonry in the Gothic or Old English style of architecture, planning and decorative embellishments and is one of the grandest castellated mansions in New South Wales. Moreover, Swifts is of both New South Wales State and Australian heritage significance, as apart from Government House, Sydney, it is the largest remaining Victorian Gothic Revival house in Australia. There is considerable diversity of the decorative styles used in the respective rooms, with the ballroom and its hallway being the work of Lyon, Cottier & Co., Sydney (the leading firm of art decorators in the last quarter of the nineteenth century). The Moorish smoking room (opium den), the upper hall and the vestibule walls and ceiling are also their work ‚Äì and most likely some of the other rooms. It is also likely that John Clay Beeler, an American trained art decorator then working in Sydney, who went on to decorate the interior of Melbourne's International Exhibition building for the 1888 Centenary, undertook work in the interior decoration. The copy of Guido Reni's Aurora in the sopraporte is believed to be the work of the Italian decorator in Sydney Signor Lorenzini, who regarded Reni as a master Italian artist from the early seventeenth century. Swifts remains on its original grounds and still consists of much of the 19th-century landscape, statuary, terrace wall, stairs and paths. Swifts Mansion, photo taken at dusk following completion of the restoration Cultural significance Swifts demonstrated a unique phase in Australia's colonial history with the rise of an upper-middle class, exemplified by Sir Robert Lucas-Tooth, whose wealth was generated through brewing as well as agriculture, commerce and industry. With its almost intact historic curtilage, Swifts and its garden setting are rare survivors, arguably owing to the long occupation by, and benevolence of, the Resch family. Its iconic status in Australia's cultural heritage has been supported through the extensive conservation program of Dr Shane Moran. Swifts' connection with the Roman Catholic Church is also of social significance as it was home to three cardinals: Gilroy, Freeman and Clancy. The gardens at Swifts are significant as a distinctive cultural landscape associated with individuals and families important in the development of Sydney and of New South Wales. It is a particularly fine example of a landscaped garden developed in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century reflecting particular design trends and planting styles. The special relationship of the grounds to the house is a significant factor in determining the status of the grounds as an item of environmental heritage. Stained Glass Window 1880s original stained glass window situated above main staircase at Swifts The large original 1880s arch stained glass window, situated above the main staircase and believed to be the work of Lyon, Cottier & Co Sydney, has also been fully restored. It depicts, above, King John of England signing the Magna Carta on 15 June 1215 at Runnymede, near Windsor. Below is King Henry V of England following his victory against the numerically superior French army at the Battle of Agincourt in 1415 (which boosted English morale and prestige, crippled France, and started a new period of English dominance in the Hundred Years' War). Fincham & Hobday Organ Organ in situ at Gawler In an article on \\"Society Doings in Sydney\\", dated 6 September 1902 from The Australasian Newspaper, there is a description of the home as follows: \\"Swifts is a handsome mansion with towers, situated at the end of Darling Point. One of its attractions is a ballroom, with a dado, on which are painted the portraits of eminent musicians. In a raised alcove there is an orchestral organ (the largest of its kind in Sydney), which plays like a musical box when wound up. The guests [of the reception held by Mr and Mrs Resch in honour of the Queen of Holland] were interested in inspecting the organ, and listening to operatic selections\\". It is believed that the original orchestral pipe organ was from the Welte Company of Freiburg in Germany. On 1 December 2016, Dr. Shane Moran installed an historic Australian made Fincham & Hobday pipe organ into the organ chamber. The organ was built in 1885 by Fincham & Hobday, Adelaide for the Congregational Church, Gawler, South Australia. The fa√ßade of the organ was decorated by the firm of H. L. Vosz. In 2011 the organ was gifted to the Organ Historical Trust of Australia. In 2015, Dr and Mrs Moran purchased the organ and engaged Hargraves Pipe Organs Pty Ltd of Mt Evelyn, Victoria, to undertake substantial restoration work over the course of more than a year, resulting in the organ being restored to its former grandeur. Out of a total of eleven new organs constructed by Fincham & Hobday during the 19th century, this is one of only three instruments by the Adelaide firm to survive intact, retaining its original mechanical key and stop actions, pipework, casework with carved detail and attached console. It is the only example of its work to be found outside South Australia. It is of considerable significance for its outstanding quality of workmanship and choice of materials, its delightful sound, and the retention of the original fa√ßade pipe decoration. The superior mechanical and tonal style of the organ has been strongly influenced by the 1877 Hill & Son organ in the Adelaide Town Hall, which the firm worked upon, and differs considerably from the firm's Melbourne productions. The organ was opened at Gawler on 13 September 1885 and was enlarged by Fincham & Hobday to two manuals in 1888.  Heritage listing  As at 10 March 2009, Swifts is of State significance as, apart from Government House in Sydney, it is the largest remaining Victorian Gothic Revival house in Australia. Swifts remains on its original grounds and still consists of the original landscape, statuary, terrace wall, stairs and paths. It is a prime example of how the upper-class people lived in the 19th century in Australia. Swifts is also of cultural significance as it was home of two well known Sydney business families, the Lucas-Tooth and Resch families. Swifts connection with the Roman Catholic Church is also of social significance as it was home to three cardinals; Gilroy, Freeman and Clancy. The building is also significant because it is an example of the work of Gustauus Alphose Morell, a prominent Sydney architect in the late 19th century.Lucas, 1994, 128 The western section of the garden of Swifts formed an integral part of the original design of the grounds. The special relationship of the grounds to the mansion is a significant factor in determining the status of the grounds as an item of environmental heritage. The building together with its site is an item of environmental heritage (excerpt from \\"Findings\\" of Commissioner of Inquiry, 1983, p. 55). Swifts was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. Swifts is of State significance for its associations with two brewing families ‚Äì the Tooth's who built the house and the Resch's who subsequently lived in it. Swifts is of State significance as the official residence of three cardinals: Gilroy, Freeman and Clancy. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Swifts is of State significance as a unique ensemble of late- Victorian house and extensive landscaped ground, complete with statuary, balustrade terrace wall, stairs, paths, mature trees that, in their picturesque setting within the foreshores of Sydney harbour, epitomises the development of \\"taste\\" in nineteenth century colonial New South Wales.Lucas, Stapleton & Partners 1994:128 The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Swifts is of significance as a rare example of the work of architect Gustavus Alphose Morell. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. Swifts is of State significance as Sydney's largest and most intact late Victorian mansion. With the exception of Government House, it illustrates the complex planning and detail thought necessary for an upper-class family at the end of the nineteenth century. this includes the total ensemble of house, service rooms, outhouses and grounds. Swifts in popular culture Although currently a private home, Swifts is regularly featured in films and hosts distinguished cultural events.

The current library building in Wellington was completed in 1899 and is the oldest of the extant buildings in the Parliament complex. It stands to the north of Parliament House (to its right, looking from the front). History and building design The library was originally designed as a three-storey building by Thomas Turnbull in Gothic Revival style. It was fire resistant, being constructed of brick made at Mount Cook gaol with an iron firedoor separating the library from the main entrance section. The third storey of the design was not built to save money (costs had reached ¬£50,000) and it was completed by the government architect John Campbell. He redesigned the parapets, gables and roof to take account of the building's reduced height. Turnbull dissociated himself from the entire project and asked for his name to be removed from the foundation stone. The fireproofing saved the library from the fire of 1907, which destroyed the rest of the wooden parliament buildings. (Coincidentally, the same thing happened in Ottawa, Canada, in 1916‚Äîwith fire doors saving the Library of Parliament when the Centre Block of the Canadian Parliament burned.) 1990s refurbishment Like Parliament House, the building was strengthened and refurbished between 1993 and 1995. The building design was replicated to match the original designs. The ornate main foyer, which was damaged by another fire in 1992, was refurbished. The Gothic elements of the roof, including ironwork, turrets, and finials, were recreated. The original iron door (that saved the library in 1907) was restored. The building is registered with the New Zealand Historic Places Trust as a Category I heritage structure with registration number 217. Services The Parliamentary Library is an information repository and research service for members of Parliament and parliamentary staff. Access to the building is generally restricted to those on parliamentary business, yet research publications produced are available to the public. By the 1920s the library's collection had reached more than 100,000 volumes; by 1950 this has grown to 200,000 volumes. In 1966 the Parliamentary Library became part of the new National Library of New Zealand; much of the library's collection (close to half a million volumes) was moved to other National Library locations, while relevant texts remain in the Gothic building. In 1985 the Parliamentary Library left the National Library to become part of the newly-formed Parliamentary Service.

It is located to the northwest of the Hellas impact basin within the furthest outskirts of the Hellas debris apron. The crater is 165 km in diameter and likely formed during the Late Heavy Bombardment, a period of intense bolide impacts affecting the entirety of the Solar System; during the Hesperian period, aeolian processes caused significant degradation of the crater's rim features and infilled the crater's floor (which is nearly at the same elevation as the surrounding plains terrain). Similar to other large craters in this region of Mars, wind-eroded features are sporadically found on the basin floor. The presence of wrinkle ridges of varying orientations within and around the Denning basin has been correlated to regional tectonic events, including the formation of the Hellas basin itself. The crater was named for British astronomer William Frederick Denning. Context Denning Crater is in the Sinus Sabaeus quadrangle of Mars centered at 17.7¬∞ south latitude and 326.6¬∞ west longitude, a quadrangle which it shares (among others) with Schiaparelli crater to the northwest, Dawes crater to the east-northeast, and Flaugergues crater, due west of Denning. The crater lies to the northwest of the Hellas impact basin at the outermost edges of its ejecta blanket. Denning Crater was formally named by the International Astronomical Union in 1973 after William F. Denning, a British astronomer (1848‚Äì1931). Geology Quadrangle map of Sinus Sabaeus labeled with major features. Colored rectangles represent image footprints of Mars Global Surveyor. Hellas Planitia lies beyond the southeast edge of the quadrangle boundary. Up is north. Denning Crater is among a series of large craters formed across the Martian southern highlands during the Late Heavy Bombardment period of the Solar System's early history (between 4.1 and 3.8 Ga), which occurred during the Noachian period of Martian geologic history. It is about 165 km in diameter. After the crater's initial Noachian-age formation and into the Hesperian period, weathering and sediment transport is thought to have degraded Denning's rim and infilled its basin. Within Denning and other craters within Terra Sabaea in particular, crater floor materials were later exposed to aeolian deflation, leaving relict knobby terrains and exposing the basin's stratigraphy on regional scales. Valleys incised by such processes are geomorphically distinctive from landforms produced by fluvial processes. Denning Crater lies at the outermost stretches of a regime of hilly and cratered mottled terrain surrounding Hellas, interpreted as the reworked remnants of that impact basin's ejecta blanket. This geologic unit overlies a moderately-cratered plains unit that stretches intermittently across much of the Terra Sabaea region. This plains unit is interpreted to comprise eolian materials infilling lower areas in the cratered bedrock. Since Denning's formation, seven large craters have overprinted Denning's original features. Five of these craters themselves have been superposed by two other more recent impacts. A significant portion of the Denning basin is dominated by wrinkle ridges in three different overriding orientations. One of these wrinkle ridge sets is part of a larger regional grouping that is concentric to the Hellas basin. As the asthenosphere compensated for the Hellas impact with large-scale flow towards the Hellas basin, concentric faulting occurred about the crater in the form of graben. Lava emerged from these extensional faults, forming arcuate sets of volcanic material that became ridges as the less competent country rock was weathered away over time. Much like other Noachian-age large craters in Terra Sabaea, Denning demonstrates evidence of significant and prolonged crater rim degradation, and its ejecta blanket has been extensively reworked. The crater's floor is flat (appearing totally smooth at resolutions consistent with NASA's THEMIS instrument aboard the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter) with no apparent central peak. Observational history The neighborhood of Denning Crater was first mapped using orbital data in 1980 as part of an initiative by the United States Geological Survey Astrobiology Center. Also under purview of the USGS, a later map of the greater region was published by Ronald Greeley and John Guest in 1987, and then globally by Kenneth Tanaka and co-workers in 2014. A 1981 study by workers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory discerned morphological trends of various large Martian craters from morphometric data, noting that Denning Crater's floor was at an elevation nearly identical to that of surrounding terrain. Of the different craters studied, this elevation differential was least extreme in Denning Crater. In the mid-1980s, various researchers interpreted sets of wrinkle ridges in the Denning basin concentric about the Hellas impact basin as evidence of low-viscosity lava flows associated with large-scale extensional faulting of the Martian lithosphere, coincident with the Hellas impact. The volcanic nature of deposits around these wrinkle ridges was later confirmed with spectroscopic data. In 1992, Finnish researchers also studying the orientation of wrinkle ridges noted a north-trending wrinkle ridge set cross- cutting Denning Crater and the intercrater highlands around it. These correspond to other north-trending wrinkle ridges also seen in Schiaparelli and Flaugergues craters, suggesting that a separate regional event across Terra Sabaea induced the formation of those ridges. A 2007 study by Californian and Virginian researchers reported the completion of a systematic global survey of alluvial fans present within Martian impact craters using THEMIS as its dataset. This was a more complete elaboration on an earlier investigation published in 2005. Although a large concentration of crater- based large alluvial fans were identified in the Terra Sabaea region, the study did not identify any such subaerial fluvial morphology in Denning Crater. In 2018, a new study characterized the nature of wind-eroded crater floor materials across Terra Sabaea, including Denning Crater.

It was designed by J. F. Hilly (1846), Edmund Blacket (1859) and Leslie Wilkinson (1935) and built from 1846 to 1849 by Thomas Woolley (1841); Thomas Sutcliffe Mort. It is also known as Bishopscourt and Greenoaks. Up until December 2015, the property was owned by the Anglican Church of Australia; and is now privately owned. The property was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History =Colonial history Originally known by its Aboriginal name Yarranabbee, Darling Point was called Mrs Darling's Point by Ralph Darling (1825-31 Governor) in honour of his wife. At that time the area was open forest, but after New South Head Road was built in 1831 timber cutters felled most of the trees, and the land was subdivided. Most of the plots, covering in this area, were taken up between 1833 and 1838. The suburb became known as Darling Point. Several notable people bought land and built homes here, including surveyor-general Sir Thomas Mitchell's Carthona and one-time home Lindesay. Around the middle of the 1800s residents included the Reverend George Fairfowl Macarthur, one time rector at St Mark's church, Darling Point, members of the Tooth family, brewers, at Swifts, and Samuel Hordern, retail king. Percyville, later Greenoaks The land (of what became Percyville/Greenoaks/Bishopscourt) (then allotment 11) was purchased by Elizabeth Pike and Thomas Smith (Elizabeth Pike's \\"grant\\" passed to Richard Jones and Joseph Hyde Potts in between June 1835 and July 1836. By 1835-6 a small residence was built by Richard Jones - presumably s three roomed single storey cottage with an entrance porch. the house was extended - presumably made two storeys - its architect is unknown. A window was removed from the west facade space G11 and an oriel window was installed.NBRS, 2014, 6 By 1841, a portion of Jones & Potts' land and of Smith's grant (making up ) was purchased by Thomas Woolley, ironmonger, who built a two-storey stone cottage \\"Percyville\\" on the site with J. F. Hilly as architect.Woollahra History & Heritage Society Most of the front of the present house is this original Percyville design. Originally known as Greenoaks, Bishopscourt was designed by Edmund Blacket. A cottage originally occupied the site, and the owner, Thomas Sutcliffe Mort, built the sandstone Gothic Revival mansion around this building, circa 1850-1860. Further extensions were made in 1935 after being designed by Leslie Wilkinson. The exterior features Tudor windows and carved doors and crests. The interior was based on the Palace of Westminster and is considered to be an outstanding example of Blacket's work, with stained-glass windows, tiled floors, an elaborate staircase and panelled library. =Thomas Sutcliffe Mort= In 1845 Thomas Sutcliffe Mort leased the land, purchasing it in 1846 for A¬£2,500, and then in the late 1850s/60s commenced work on a house he called Greenoaks.Lawrence, 1993 -55 alterations were made by architect J. F. Hilly and Mr Page was the builder. These included stables, bays to the morning room (G11), the drawing room (G9), a staircase (the position of Hilly's staircase is uncertain - it may have been in rooms G6 and F11). The position of a label mould indicates an early stair in that area but its date and origin are unclear), stained glass windows to the stairhall and old study (G14 and G13), and an extension to the south (G5, G4B). In 1853 Hilly called for tenders for a new stables and coach house for premises at Darling Point. Stained glass for Greenoakes was ordered from Hardman's of Birmingham. A further tender notice by Hill which may relate to Greenoaks (11/7/1854) was for \\"additions to residence, Darling Point\\". Tender notice for plasterers of January 1855 may relate to Greenoakes. An estimate for or ornament was received (12/1858) from George Jackson & Son of London. Mort, businessman and horticulturist, was born at Bolton, Lancashire, England and worked as a clerk, seizing the chance to migrate to Sydney in 1838 to bolster the family fortunes. In 1843 he set up as an auctioneer, becoming an innovator in wool sales. His pastoral interests included Franklyn Vale, in the Darling Downs, Queensland and Bodalla at the mouth of the Tuross River, South Coast, NSW. By the end of the 1840s his fortune was made, but he restlessly pursued other projects, some ill-starred. In 1841 he married Therese, daughter of Commissary-General James Laidley. Mort pioneered weekly wool auctions and the refrigeration of food, was involved in moves for the first railway in NSW, and was a founder of the AMP Society. He was instrumental in construction of Mort's Dock at Balmain in 1854, which gave Sydney a dry dock for repairing ships. His wealth facilitated his considerable horticultural ambitions. Greenoaks, his Darling Point property, set the tone among fashionable villas of this choice Sydney resort. Mort used architect F. J. Hilly who transformed the original cottage Percyville (which stood in more than of ground) into a two storied Gothic Revival gentleman's residence. Mort renamed it Greenoaks and also transformed its grounds from 1846.Tanner & Begg, 1976, p.31Morris, 2002 Mort enjoyed his wealth and it gave rein to a natural flamboyance which, often hidden in his personal dealings, was epitomized in his house where it flowered in Academic Gothic Revival extravagances. In his 1857-59 visit to England he attended a sale at the earl of Shrewsbury's Alton Towers. Among other acquisitions were Elizabethan armour, old English coats of mail, a cabinet that had belonged to Marie Antoinette, antique oak furniture and about 120 pictures. On his return he engaged architect Edmund Blacket to make additions to the house (including a covered carriageway, stables and kitchens) and an art gallery which, with his gardens, were open to the public. 1860 additions and alterations were made by Blacket to the southern wing (possibly incorporating the ground floor kitchen and including construction of a southern basement), a picture gallery (single storey), nursery, second entrance and porte cochere, some applied decoration and embellishment to existing interiors and a new staircase and stair hall. A keen gardener, Mort won many prizes at the flower shows in the 1840s and 1850s. In 1851 he served on the committee of management of the Australasian Botanical and Horticultural Society and in the 1870s became president of the Horticultural Society of New South Wales. He was also a vice-president of the Agricultural Society in 1861-78. He was a commissioner for the 1873 London International Exhibition and in 1876 for the Philadelphia and Melbourne International Exhibitions. At meetings of the Australasian Botanic and Horticultural Society in Sydney Mort first met newly-arrived Irish-English nurseryman and landscape designer Michael Guilfoyle. Greatly impressed with his knowledge and experience and having heard something of the prowess of the Guilfoyle family in England in such matters, he commissioned him to develop and landscape Greenoaks. The success of this, which occupied Guilfoyle for a period of some 12 months, together with the considerable influence that Mort exerted in the community, ensured that the future of Michael Guilfoyle in the field of landscape design and nursery practice was assured. The garden became famous in its time and was regarded as one of the finest in Sydney.Pescott, 1974, 6 Mort and Guilfoyle created a celebrated landscape garden from 1849. Guilfoyle used the steep sloping site to provide a wild, romantic setting for the medieval mansion, and a wide variety of plants to provide botanical and visual interest, most likely supplied from his \\"Exotic Nursery\\" in Double Bay, which adjoined Greenoaks to the south. When the Duke of Edinburgh first visited Sydney in 1853, he made a special journey \\"along New South Head Road to visit Mr Mort's garden, and there tasted a rare date plum (probably a Diospyros lotus, date plum from America), grown only by Mr Guilfoyle.\\"Daily Telegraph, 2007, 30Read, S., pers. comm. =Michael Guilfoyle= Michael Guilfoyle (-1884), nursery proprietor and landscape gardener, received his early training in London and rose to the position of foreman at the Royal Exotic Nursery, King's Road, Chelsea. This nursery, established in 1808 by Joseph Knight (and later owned by the famous Veitch family of nurserymen) specialised in greenhouse and stove plants. Knight had such faith in Guilfoyle's abilities that he sent him to many parts of the Kingdom to lay out or remodel parks and gardens frequently without even inspecting his work. In 1849 Guilfoyle and his family emigrated to Sydney, and established a nursery in Kellick Street, Redfern, which soon failed. He then gained the patronage of T. S. Mort. Greenoaks grounds became the \\"leading and model private garden of NSW\\", described at length in the \\"Horticultural Magazine\\" 1865. As noted above, Mort was president of the Horticultural Society of NSW, publisher of the magazine, and Guilfoyle was listed in it as one of the \\"good and first rate gardeners\\" formerly employed at Greenoaks. Mort owned land down the hill from Greenoaks, in Double Bay, where he had his vegetable garden, and offices and Guilfoyle occupied a cottage there (at the corner of South and Ocean Streets). By 1851 Guilfoyle had established a nursery on of land belonging to Mort. He developed this site until 1875, still leasing it from Mort. In this nursery Guilfoyle stocked flowering and evergreen trees and a wide selection of conifers, \\"probably one of the most complete in the colony\\" (journal entry by exteemed visiting English nurseryman John Gould Veitch in 1864). His 1862 catalogue listed 2,500 plants. This nursery was described by esteemed English nurseryman Veitch in 1864, as \\"if not the largest, one of the best nurseries in the colony.\\" Veitch describes in the same journal entry, Mr Mort's garden of Darling Point as one of \\"few private gardens in Sydney where gardening is carried on with any spirit. Those of Mr Thomas Mort, of Darling Point, the late Mr William Macleay of Elizabeth Bay and Sir Daniel Cooper of Rose Bay, formerly contained good collections of native and imported plants, but now they are no longer kept up\\".Morris, 1994 Guilfoyle overcame the difficulty in propagating jacarandas (J.mimosifolia) in 1868, enabling the widespread use of this spectacular flowering tree for the first time. He raised new varieties of popular plants such as verbena, camellia, and azalea, and attempted to popularise both in Australia and Britain the plants introduced from the Pacific Islands by Charles Moore, then- Director of the Sydney Botanic Gardens, and his son William Robert Guilfoyle, on a voyage of 1868. He is known to have sought two cases of Norfolk Island pine (Araucaria heterophylla) from Charles Moore in 1855, (which may have been the source of the specimen depicted in an 1857 engraving of Greenoaks).Clough, 2002 In 1860 Mort acquired the Bodalla estate on the South Coast of NSW, where his gardener Michael Bell took up farm management, replaced at Greenoaks by George Mortimore. Both gardeners, like Guilfoyle and Mort, were active members of the Horticultural Society of NSW; Mort became its respected president in the 1862 Morris, 2002). He maintained his enthusiasm for horticulture over 30 years, first as an exhibitor and top prize winner in the Horticultural Society's shows, and later as an administrator. He retained the position of President until 1878Parsons/RHS NSW, 2012, 23 and pursued hybridisation of cacti in Sydney's premier garden. An 1857 engraving of Greenoaks shows the generous expanse of the pleasure garden at one of Sydney's most celebrated villa gardens, and indicates prickly pear bushes (Opuntia spp.) in the foreground, dense shrubberies and trees, and an emergent Norfolk Island pine (Araucaria heterophylla) near the house. Greenoaks Cottage (now at 3a Greenoaks Avenue) is a substantial Gothic Revival house built in the late 1860s by Mort intending to move into it while leasing Greenoaks. A strong high churchman, Mort was one of the most prominent Anglican laymen in Sydney. He gave the land for St Mark's Church, Darling Point, commissioned Edmund Blacket to design it and contributed generously to its building and upkeep as well as to the building of St Andrew's Cathedral and St Paul's College, University of Sydney. He was a founding fellow of the college and a warden of St Mark's. He was also the founder of Christ Church School in Pitt Street and a friend of Bishop Patteson.Alan Barnard, \\"Mort, Thomas Sutcliffe (1816 - 1878)\\", Australian Dictionary of Biography, Volume 5, Melbourne University Press, 1974, pp 299-301. Mort's wife Therese died in 1869. Tumbling wool prices forced him to mortgage Greenoaks. However following Theresa's death in 1869 from cancer, he did not make the move. In the front garden of 2D Greenoaks Avenue, next door, is the replica statue of \\"The Dying Gladiator\\", which once graced the garden of Greenoaks. In 1874 he married Marianne Elizabeth Macauley, who ran the St. Mark's Crescent School. Mort died in 1878 at Bodalla but his second wife lived at Greenoaks until 1892. The trustees of his will agreed to sell the property to a grazier, Michael Campbell Langtree, who then subdivided the estate. A statue to Mort was erected in Macquarie Place in 1883. The Governor's unveiling of the statue was witnessed by hundreds of workers who had voluntarily forfeited a day's pay in order that they might be present for this final tribute to their late employer.Parsons/RHS NSW, 2012, 25 The house was let to various tenants until 1910. It was offered for sale at public auction on 5 July 1910 by Richardson & Wrench and passed in, failing to meet its reserve.NBRS 2014, 7 Anglican Church Campbell Langtree agreed to subdivide and sell part of Greenoaks to the Church of England (for A¬£6,750 in 1910Chancellor, 25_26/9/10 as a residence for the Archbishop of Sydney. Then Archbishop John Wright found his Randwick residence \\"too far from the centre of things to be a city dwelling and not far enough out to be a country retreat\\".McKenny, 2013 The house was renamed Bishopscourt and was dedicated as the home of the Anglican Archbishop of Sydney on 24 October 1910. In 1910 Greenoakes Avenue was partly constructed. On 6 & 7 December 1910 the contents of the house were sold at auction. On 8 December 1910 Greenoakes was conveyed by Mort's Trustees to Langtree for A¬£15,000 and part by him to the Church of England on the same day for A¬£6,750. The major subdivision of the property (the residue of Mort's estate), when Greenoaks Avenue was put through, took place in 1911. The subdivision and sale was at auction on the proviso: \\"Any building erected on the land must be of brick or stone with roof of slates, tiles or shingles and most cost and be of a value of not less than A¬£750\\". A service of dedication was held for Bishopscourt on 26 August 1911. From 1911 until 2015 it was the residence of eight Anglican Archbishops including Sir Marcus Loane, Donald Robinson, Harry Goodhew, Peter JensenChancellor, 2010 and Glenn Davies. It is regarded as the finest Gothic Revival residence in New South Wales. Between 1911-13 renovations were undertaken for the church by architect, J. Burcham Clamp, replacing shingle roof with slates, installing electricity, new water and sewer servies, fixing and supplying outside Venetian blinds, fences to boundary lines, entrance gates, stone steps to the lawn, erection of a tennis screen, repairs to the tank over the main laundry, erection of a summer house on the western boundary, converting the small chapel into a library, removing the kitchen (basement to ground floor level), erecting balconies, probably over the northern verandah, removed in 1927), partial subdivision of the picture gallery, construction of a small bathroom extension (G1), replacing some window sashes, general repairs - some internal rearrangement of the Blacket wing, new window to the library. The contractors were Messrs Robert Watt & Sons with the grounds, gates and walls done by Mr Neal. In 1927 additions and alterations designed by H. E. Ross & Rowe were approved (11/7/1927) for the removal of the timber stair and further subdivision of the picture gallery (a new concrete stair), a new kitchen at ground floor, new stone balcony to the north, alteration of the first floor accommodation, alteration to windows in the kitchen and servery. The southern block was divided into two parts, offered for sale to fund alterations but due to problems of land access the land was withdrawn from sale on 20/10/1927 having failed to reach its anticipated price. In 1935 a chapel was constructed on the western facade by R. H. Ross & Rowe (supervising architect: R.Lindsay Little), the oriel window was partially removed at this time. The house was later (1935) remodelled and extended at a cost of ¬£10,000 by Prof. Leslie Wilkinson, head of the Architecture Faculty at Sydney University. Wilkinson had a marked effect on Sydney's architecture and built over 50 houses in the eastern suburbs. a brick enclosure was built in the basement (B4) and a back screen to the door for use as an air raid shelter. Further alterations and additions were made in 1959 by R. Lindsay Little: work on the drainage system, retaining walls, redecoration of the interior (including removal of some original decorative elements in the drawing room and stair hall), a new hot water system, alterations to cloak room and toilet facilities and removal of outdoor fencing. Further alterations and additions were made in 1965 by Fowell Mansfield Maclurcan in conjunction with Professor Wilkinson: removal of the Blacket Porte Cochere and first floor servant accommodation and construction of private accommodation for the Archbishop, extensive garden remodelling, further subdivision to the nursery to provide separate accommodation, shortening of the stables and coach house, and relocation of windows. Nurseryman and garden designer Claude Crowe (of Berrima Bridge Nurseries) worked on numerous gardens allied to different churches, including Bishopscourt.Webb, 2012, 22 The Church contemplated selling Bishopscourt in 1963, 1982, 1991 and most recently in 2001. A subdivision off Bishopscourt's southern side was approved in 1990 and since then multi-storey terraced apartments have been built in the early 2000s in some proximity to Bishopscourt's southern side. The property still displays prominently some of the larger trees of the original Guilfoyle planting. In 1985 an interim conservation order (no. 445) was gazetted over the property. In 1990 the site was subdivided.Pescott, 1974, 8 In 2006 tree pruning, removal of selected trees and adaptation of the external drainage system was undertaken. In 2007 a master plan was prepared for the grounds and garden by David Beaver, landscape architect and heritage consultant. In 2009 conservation of the slate roof, installation of copper roof, conservation of sandstone chimneys was done. In 2010 refurbishment of a shower room in the first floor of the stables building was undertaken.NBRS 2014, 8 Private ownership The Church's governing body ended decades of debate by voting to sell the property in 2012. The estate was listed on the real estate market and sold in December 2015, ending 105 years of ownership by the Anglican Church. A local buyer exchanged on $18 million for the residence. The estate was sold by Ray White Double Bay agent Craig Pontey. \\"Several million dollars would be required in the near future for renovations and as the agreed price is at the upper end of valuations, the Trust acted prudently to conclude a sale,\\" said the chairman of the Anglican Property Trust, Dr Robert Tong. Buyer feedback has reportedly factored in costs to refurbish the property of more than $10 million.Macken, SMH, 15/12/2016 The sale returns to private hands one of the great heritage estates of the eastern suburbs, comparable to the nearby, much larger Swifts mansion which was formerly home to the Catholic Archbishop before it was bought by the Moran family. The Anglican church made the decision to sell Bishopscourt at the 2012 Synod, with 452 votes out of 579 in favour, with a five-year window in which to sell the property. Former Archbishop Peter Jensen vacated it when he retired in July 2013 and it was formally listed to expressions of interest two months later; however his successor Glenn Davies moved back in in 2014 after the property originally failed to sell. Original hopes of $25 million were revised down after it went to auction in March 2015, at which it was passed in after interest by local buyers stalled at the $20 million level. The Church sold the property in December 2015 for . Chinese billionaire Wang Qinghui took possession. Wang debuted on the Forbes Rich List of China in 2014 as a result of his early investment in the Beijing Zinwei Telecom Technology Group. This company was designated by five central government ministries to be a key software enterprise for state planning.Macken, 26-27/3/2016 In 2019 it was reported that Wang had on-sold the property to his teenage son Caleb. Fire Fire broke out in Bishopscourt in January 2019. Fire crews attended and managed to control the fire, preventing extensive damage. The fire was believed to have spread from a fireplace.  Description  Developing the site from 1846, Mort built a mansion designed by F. J. Hilly with later additions by Edmund Blacket in academic gothic style. It is a very fine domestic Gothic house built 1850s around an already existing cottage considerably enlarged by Hilly, Blacket and others, and features: * dressed sandstone with steep pitched slate roof, projecting attics, interesting stepped gable topped by two freestanding chimneys * windows and doors finely carved in Victorian Tudor design, * porte cochere in form of Gothic chapel added by Blacket in 1860. * grand stair hall with stained glass window * elaborate ceilings * fine Gothic fireplaces The coat of arms of the Mort family are carved on the sandstone walls. Mort had a private gallery which had 200 works of art, suits of English armour, and war weapons collected on a trip to England. The gallery, one of several private galleries in colonial NSW, was opened to the public once a month. The garden was said to be one of the finest in Sydney. Greenoaks set the tone among the fashionable villas of this choice Sydney resort. Mort employed the newly arrived landscape designer and nurseryman Michael Guilfoyle, and created a celebrated landscape garden from 1849. Guilfoyle used the steep sloping site to provide a wild, romantic setting for the medieval mansion, and a wide variety of plants to provide botanical and visual interest, most likely supplied from his \\"Exotic Nursery\\" in Double Bay, which adjoined Greenoaks to the south. Mort pursued hybridisation of cacti in Sydney's premier garden. An 1857 engraving of Greenoaks shows the generous expanse of the pleasure garden at one of Sydney's most celebrated villa gardens, and indicates prickly pear bushes (Opuntia spp.) in the foreground, dense shrubberies and trees, and an emergent Norfolk Island pine (Araucaria heterophylla) near the house. A number of specimen trees and shrubs have been planted by Archbishops and their wives over the years, presented as gifts etc. Coral trees (Erythrina sp.) on eastern side/bank near house were supposedly planted by one of the then Archbishop's sons, c.1950s. The house, from Greenoaks Avenue, is still shrouded by trees and there is wild growth among the coral trees and Moreton Bay figs. Golden nasturtiums tumble over the paling fence set on the surrounding stone wall. There is a huge Moreton Bay fig (Ficus macrophylla) with sculptural roots stretching to the earth.  Modifications and dates  The following modifications to the property were made: *1841a holding of purchased by Thomas Woolley, who built a two-storey stone cottage Percyville. Most of the front of the present house is the original design. *1845Thomas Sutcliffe Mort leased the land, purchasing in 1846 and then in the late 1850s-60s commenced work on transforming the original cottage into a two storied Gothic Revival gentleman's residence. *Lateradditions were made by architect Edmund Blacket to include a covered carriageway, stables, and kitchens. *1849Michael Guilfoyle commenced to create a celebrated landscape garden at Greenoaks. *1892sold to a grazier, Michael Campbell Langtree, who then subdivided the estate. Later Langtree agreed to sell part of Greenoaks to the Church of England. The house was renamed Bishopscourt and dedicated as the home of the Anglican Archbishop in 1910. The house was let to various tenants until 1910. *1911major subdivision of the property, when Greenoaks Avenue was put through *1935Professor Leslie Wilkinson designed a western two storey wing with garages below *NSW Land & Environment Court approved construction of ten penthouse style apartments on a subdivision of Bishopscourt directly south of the mansion, fronting Greenoaks Avenue (7/17 Greenoaks Avenue). Stepped up slope, with extensive basement car parking, requiring deep excavation. *2009Three Coral trees & European olives removed on eastern side: replaced with three Illawarra flame trees and underplanting per Beaver CMP.  Further information  Coral trees (Erythrina sp.) on eastern side/bank near house were supposedly planted by one of the Archbishop's sons, c.1950s.  Heritage listing  As at 3 June 2016, the historic core of a large early villa estate comprising an exceptionally fine mansion and grounds of prime historic interest built for Sydney's leading businessman, entrepreneur, horticulturist, and pioneer of exporting frozen meat, Thomas Sutcliffe Mort. Thomas Sutcliffe Mort pioneered weekly wool auctions and the refrigeration of food, was involved in moves for the first railway in NSW and was also one of the founders of the AMP Society. He was instrumental in construction of Mort's Dock at Balmain in 1854, which gave Sydney a dry dock for repairing ships. Mort was friend and patron of Edmund Blacket, in the late nineteenth century Sydney's leading architect, and Blacket designed what is probably the best Gothic picturesque house in New South Wales. Greenoaks retains the core of a once celebrated landscape garden created by Mort and nurseryman and landscape designer Michael Guilfoyle from 1849, which in its heyday became the \\"leading and model private garden of NSW\\", and set the tone in this fashionable Sydney resort.

Marriage Daughter of Anna von Miltitz and Hans von der Saale, she met the married Landgrave Philip at the age of seventeen. Philip wished to marry Saale morganatically rather than keep her as a mistress, as adultery would blacken his religious reputation, but he did not wish to divorce his consort, Christine of Saxony, as he believed that a divorce was equally sinful. On 10 December 1539, he received support from Martin Luther, with the argument that of two evil things, bigamy was better than divorce. The bigamous wedding ceremony took place on 4 March 1540 in Rotenburg Castle in the presence of Martin Bucer and Philipp Melanchthon. Saale never attended court but resided in a house beside the square in Spangenberg. The bigamy between Margarethe and Philip had a negative effect upon the reformation.

Plot Australian stuntman Grant Page accepts a job on an American television series and travels to Los Angeles, where he reunites with his cousin, Sorcery band member Curtis Hyde. Hyde performs with a heavy metal band called Sorcery, playing the part of The Prince of Darkness who is locked in cosmic combat with the King of the Wizards. While the band plays out the story with its signature brand of theatrical but muscular hard rock, Page's first stunt for the cameras goes awry and he is hospitalized, but defies his doctors by escaping out a fifth story window to get back to the set. Such reckless behavior attracts the attention of newspaper reporter Lois, who is writing an article about the career-obsessed, and co-star Monique van de Ven, who both gravitate towards the stuntman's professional fearlessness. Together they attend Sorcery concerts, enjoy Hollywood parties with the band and explore the nature of extreme living.

Eureka!\\"Brian Trenchard- Smith on Stunt Rock at Trailers From Hell He wrote a six-page outline in half an hour, motivated in part by a desire to launch Grant Page as an international star. He sent the outline to a European distributor who had bought Trenchard-Smith's previous film, Deathcheaters and who agreed to finance provided the film could be made in six months. Trenchard-Smith hurriedly went to America to look for a band. Foreigner was interested but were on a tour and would not be back in time. Trenchard-Smith luckily found the Los Angeles-based band Sorcery. Sorcery was signed to do the picture in Dec. 1977, and signed with EMI Records in January 1978. The soundtrack album was recorded at the Warner Bros. Burbank CA. studios in March 1978. It was produced by Jimmy Haskell, and released on EMI records in the summer of 1978. The director says he also had to rewrite the script to incorporate a Dutch actress for the Dutch market, and the making of the film was intensely political and happened in far too quick period of time. \\"It was a film that went from six page treatment to stereo answer print in 4 1/2 months. That is no way to make a feature and, when you see the film, you will answer why.\\" Stunt Rock includes footage from other films in which Grant Page appeared such as Mad Dog Morgan (1976). Reception In 1980 Trenchard-Smith said in an interview that the film had \\"sold very well, even though it is probably the worst film I have made. Such is life. All I can say to other filmmakers is never let yourself be pressured into making a deal rather than a film, which is what happened to me. However his opinion seemed to soften and in 2010 he said the film \\"holds a special place for me\\".\\"My Interview with Brian Trenchard Smith\\", Soldier of Cinema, 26 December 2010 accessed 8 February 2013 Stunt Rock disappeared from theaters shortly after its release, and was not seen by the general public for nearly 15 years. In 1997, a DVD of the film was released and distributed via the World Wide Web. As sales of that DVD increased, clips of the film began appearing on the web, including \\"You-Tube\\" sites, up-loaded primarily by Sorcery (Band) fans. As time passed, more people began to discover the film for the first time. That created the interest that motivated the \\"Code-Red\\" company to re-issue the film on DVD in 2009. The 2/disc DVD includes interviews with the films Producer Martin Fink, Director Brian Trenchard-Smith, Richard Blackburn,(who plays Monique's agent\\"), and who directed of the great film \\"Lemora\\" : A Child‚Äôs Tale of the upernatural (1973) plus interviews with SORCERY band members Richard Taylor(Guitarist) and Perry Morris(drummer). In 2006 Trenchard Smith tracked down a reel that was buried in someone's garage. The film has been restored and has been shown in a number of theaters around the world since then. Stunt Rock is also available on DVD.

I'm Trapped in My Teacher's Body! is a light-hearted children's science fiction novel by Todd Strasser, first published in 1993. It is the first book in his Help! I'm Trapped... series, many of which have a similar body swap premise. Plot summary Jake Sherman is sitting in his sixth grade science class with his friends Josh Hopka and Andy Kent. The class is taught by the boring teacher Mr. Dirksen, who does nothing but lecture the students, and never does anything fun. As he lectures them, Jake and his friends load spitball shooters and shoot them at Mr. Dirksen. Andy and Josh manage to hide their shooters, but Jake is caught by Mr. Dirksen. After class, Mr. Dirksen talks with Jake. He informs him that he is not going to be given detention, since Mr. Dirksen does not believe it will do any good. He says instead that Jake will, as punishment, carry a heavy box home for him. After school, Mr. Dirksen and Jake walk home to Mr. Dirksen's house. As they reach it, a storm begins to come in. Mr. Dirksen shows Jake an invention that he is building in his garage. He calls it the Dirksen Intelligence Transfer System, and hopes that it will one day gain the ability to transfer intelligence from one being to another, thus eliminating the need for education or training. As he finishes explaining his invention, a bolt of lightning strikes the house, knocking Jake and Mr. Dirksen unconscious. Jake wakes up and notices things are very different. He suddenly has an aching back and things look fuzzy. He looks across the garage to see himself looking back at him. The truth suddenly hits him: Mr. Dirksen's machine has caused Jake and his teacher to swap bodies. Mr. Dirksen (in Jake's body) informs Jake that he refuses to leave his student's body, and heads home to Jake's house. Jake (in Mr. Dirksen's body) follows, but is only thrown out of his house when his father does not recognize him and threatens to call the police. The following day, Jake takes over teaching his science class. He suddenly realize that, being in Mr. Dirksen's body, he can make the class fun. During the lesson, he teaches the students how to build bombs, much to their excitement. While Jake (Mr. Dirksen) has to write \\"I will not ask stupid questions in class.\\" 100 times on the chalkboard instead of making the bombs. While trapped in his teacher's body, Jake attempts to make life miserable for Mr. Dirksen in hopes that he will agree to switch back, but to no avail. Eventually, \\"Mr. Dirksen's\\" lessons to his science class prove so exciting that the impressed Principal Blanco praises him for them and declares him a model teacher. To celebrate this, Jake's other teacher, Mrs. Rogers, takes him out to breakfast, where she begins to fall in love with Jake in Mr. Dirksen's body and proposes marriage to him. She invites him to have a romantic dinner at her house where he can discuss the matter. Jake eventually is able to convince his sister Jessica of his predicament and gets her to help him. None of her efforts to make the intruder miserable, however, prove effective. Mr. Dirksen, however, learns of a fact that makes him decide to switch back: that if he is Jake, he will have to spend the weekend in a cabin with Andy and Josh. Jake, Mr. Dirksen, and Jessica head to Mr. Dirksen's home. Mr. Dirksen points out that if there is no bolt of lightning to strike his home, there is no hope of the machine working. Jake attempts to fly a kite up to the power line and run the rope down to the machine, but the kite crashes. Jake then gets the idea to use a baseball instead. He and his sister are not able to do it, so he leaves it up to Mr. Dirksen. Mr. Dirksen makes Jake promise that if he switches back, Jake will be a model student. Jake agrees, so Mr. Dirksen throws the ball. It succeeds in wrapping around the line. The trio hurry to the garage and attach the line to the machine. Soon, another lightning bolt strikes the house, knocking Jake and his teacher unconscious. When they wake, they are back in their bodies. Mr. Dirksen agrees to make his classes more exciting from then on and heads to his dinner date with Mrs. Rogers. In an epilogue, Jake talks with Mrs. Rogers, who reveals she and Mr. Dirksen are engaged.

Built in 1797, it is an unusually high quality and high style Federal period in an area that was very much a frontier at the time. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. Description and history The Alden House stands on the south side of Common Road, a short way west of its junction with Maine State Route 131 in the center of the rural community of Union. It is a 2-1/2 story brick and wood frame structure, with a side gable roof, and clapboarded sides with quoined corners. A single-story shed-roof addition and 1-1/2 story ell extend from its east side. It has three principal facades with entrances at their centers. Two of them have surrounds of pilasters topped by half-round transoms and gabled pediments, while the third has an entablature and flat cornice. Windows are sash throughout, and the end gables are pedimented. The interior of the house features high quality carved woodwork, executed by the builder and owner, master carver Ebenezer Alden. The house was built by Alden in 1797, when Union (settled in 1774) was little more than a frontier settlement. Its designs appear to be based in part on plans from plate 40 of William Pain's Practical House Carpenter, published in 1794. Other design elements may have been derived from Alden's work on Montpelier, the mansion of General Henry Knox in nearby Thomaston. It is said that General Knox was dining here in 1806 when he swallowed a chicken bone, leading to infection and his eventual death. The house remained in the hands of Alden's descendants until 1965.

Ratcliffe attended Reed College for one and a half years before transferring to the University of California at Berkeley to finish his bachelor's degree and complete his PhD. He was also a Stegner Fellow at Stanford in 1974-75. The focus of Ratcliffe's early academic career was on Renaissance poetry.Stephen Ratcliffe / Jeffrey Schrader: Interview 7.19.08. Note: this interview is appearing in Jacket2, a remodeled version of Jacket (magazine), an on-line literary periodical Ratcliffe has pointed to his work on Thomas Campion during this time period as a defining event in his artistic development and poetic practice up to this point. By the early 1980s, Ratcliffe had begun to read and ‚Äòlearn‚Äô about, and from, the Language poets after his friend Bill Berkson, a fellow poet from Bolinas, gave Ratcliffe his set of original L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E magazines. Ratcliff draws much of his inspiration from where he lives in Bolinas, Califonia. Poetics and recent work Ratcliffe recognizes that his own particular commitment to writing has, over the years, displayed itself as something which works \\"serially\\": Ratcliffe's writing from the past decade, beginning with 2000's Listening to Reading and stretching towards his most recent, ongoing Temporality project, becomes the insistent 'capture' of what, following on Merleau-Ponty, it could mean for us to be \\"meeting time on the way to subjectivity\\".Merleau-Ponty, Maurice. Phenomenology of Perception. London & New York: Routledge Classics, 2002; p. 476 From this perspective, Ratcliffe's work not only addresses (tacitly) the concept of the \\"postmodern\\" 'crisis of the subject', but continues to invest itself, with increasing compactness and stability, in themes and obsessions he has delineated throughout his career, vocation, and a life devoted to \\"making\\" or poiesis. Such an intense avowal implicates Ratcliffe's project within a timeline moving forward from the Renaissance poets to St√©phane Mallarm√© and Henry James, or moving backward in time from Leslie Scalapino to the Language poets and Gertrude Stein. Along the way, in either direction, Ratcliffe may take instruction from practices as widely divergent as the radicalized \\"quietude\\" of Yvor Winters, or the aleatoric music and chance procedures of John Cage.the jacket cover of Ratcliffe's 1992 publication spaces in the light said to be where one/ comes from features Cage's engraving \\"Changes and Disappearances, #35\\" (see also: Aleatoricism) Ratcliffe never strayed far from the themes of \\"music\\" and \\"being in number\\" discovered in his initial \\"Campion project\\". He has not abandoned the touchstone that is Mallarm√©, whose work he appropriated mid- career, culminating with 1998's Mallarm√©: Poem in Prose. Ratcliffe's discussions of his writing processes, both in his interviews and essays, continue to acknowledge, along with Mallarm√©, that: Selected bibliography ;Criticism * Campion: On Song (Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1981)dissertation at Berkeley * Listening to Reading (Albany, NY: SUNY Press, 2000) * Reading the Unseen: (Offstage) Hamlet (Denver, CO: Counterpath Press, 2010) ;Poetry * New York Notes (Tombouctou Books, 1983) * Distance (Bolinas, CA: Avenue B, 1986) * Mobile/Mobile (Los Angeles, CA: Echo Park Press, 1987) * [where late the sweet] BIRDS SANG (Oakland, CA: O Books, 1989) * Sonnets (Elmwood, CT: Potes & Poets Press, 1989) * Talking in Tranquility: Interviews with Ted Berrigan (edited by Ratcliffe & Leslie Scalapino).

The PandaBoard ES is a newer version based on the OMAP4460 SoC, with the CPU and GPU running at higher clock rates. Like its predecessor, it is a community supported development platform. Features Description of the PandaBoard The OMAP4430 SoC on the PandaBoard features a dual-core 1 GHz ARM Cortex-A9 MPCore CPU, a 304 MHz PowerVR SGX540 GPU, IVA3 multimedia hardware accelerator with a programmable DSP, and 1 GiB of DDR2 SDRAM. The PandaBoard ES uses a newer SoC, with a dual-core 1.2 GHz CPU and 384 MHz GPU. Primary persistent storage is via an SD Card slot allowing SDHC cards up to 32 GB to be used. The board includes wired 10/100 Ethernet as well as wireless Ethernet and Bluetooth connectivity. Its size is slightly larger than the ETX/XTX Computer form factor at . The board can output video signals via DVI and HDMI interfaces. It also has 3.5 mm audio connectors. It has two USB host ports and one USB On- The-Go port, supporting USB 2.0.  Operating systems The device runs the Linux kernel, with either traditional distributions or the Android or Mozilla Firefox OShttps://developer.mozilla.org/en- US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS/Pandaboard user environment. Optimised versions of Android and Ubuntu are available from the Linaro Foundation. Linaro has selected the PandaBoard to be one of the hardware platforms they support with monthly build images. OpenBSD supports PandaBoard. FreeBSD added PandaBoard support in August 2012.http://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/freebsd- hackers/2012-August/040263.html The Genode Operating System Framework added support in release 12.05 (May 2012). A version of is actively developed. QNX Neutrino 6.5.0 SP1 and 6.6.0 have Board Support Packages for the PandaBoard and PandaBoard ES.  Graphics  The PandaBoard has an integrated SGX540 graphics processor and provides 1080p HDMI output. This GPU supports OpenGL ES 2.0, OpenGL ES 1.1, OpenVG 1.1 and EGL 1.3. The situation for Linux - x11 utilizing hardware floating point libraries is PowerVR's SGX540 GPU hardware is unusable without a GPU driver. Furthermore, PowerVR will not release documentation so that an open source driver could be produced. This all adds up to the GPU hardware being unavailable, so the above-mentioned features of course will not function. To be perfectly clear, a Pandaboard es will not play any low quality video, so 1080p output via the HDMI is certainly and proven not possible. Due to PowerVR making the driver unavailable, and withholding the documentation on the GPU hardware, the only alternative is the difficult and inefficient reverse engineering method to develop a GPU driver.

He is the producer and host of the Television series Chasing Monsters, an adventurous fishing related show where viewers follow his adventures in search of the largest fishes in the world... Cyril‚Äôs growing interest in fishing started as a young child and soon became a boundless passion. Originally from Haute Savoie in France, it was in this mountainous region that he grew up and got his start in fishing by targeting pike from the surrounding lakes and ponds. His quest for underwater creatures continues to this day. With adventure sports such as surfing and diving as hobbies, Chauquet shows a true interest and dedication for angling. After achieving a Bachelor‚Äôs degree in Business Administration from Webster University, Cyril started his career as an agent for a sport-fishing tour operator, he worked as a freelance journalist for fishing magazines and even became a sport fishing guide. He then founded and ran a sport fishing lodge called ‚ÄúMorocco Fishing Adventures‚Äù. In the early 2000s, Chauquet arrived in Toronto, eventually settling in Quebec where he began working on his broadcast project. In 2005, Cyril kickstarted his television career in the show titled Fishing Adventurer, he established himself as the television host of his own documentary series in which he embarks on extreme fishing adventures in the most remote locations around the globe. With around 100 episodes produced in several languages, the charismatic ‚Äúglobetrotter angler‚Äù has been chasing, catching and releasing the world‚Äôs most colossal, dangerous and bizarre underwater creatures. The show considers itself half fishing/half adventure, documenting fascinating and untold stories as he goes along. The arrival of season 4 in 2013 marks a turning point for the show. Cyril Chauquet decides to reduce the format to 12 episodes per season, at a rate of one season every 2 years. At the same time, the team is choosing to focus more and more on the adventure, travel and exceptional fish aspects of the show. The success of the 4th season sparked the interest of new TV channels around the world. The show was then renamed Chasing Monsters internationally. Chasing Monsters is an adventure show that uses fishing as an inspiration. Cyril is compared to the Indiana Jones of fishing. In 2015 his new show titled Chasing Monsters made its debut. Season 1 of Chasing Monsters aired in 2016. The format remains 12 episodes per season and the show becomes increasingly adventure-oriented. This change in narrative allows Chasing Monsters to captivate a much larger audience which appeals to more than just fisher people. This change is what helped Chasing Monsters find its way to big channels such as BBC and even Netflix. In 2017 season 2 was released and then in August 2018, Season 3 of Chasing Monsters containing 12 episodes was released in Canada as well as in Asia. Season 4 of Chasing Monsters containing only 6 episodes is on course to be released by the end of the year 2020. Cyril has an impressive track record of world record-sized catches including a 550lb giant river Stingray (Himantura Chaophraya) in Thailand, a massive 200lb-plus Arapaima (Arapaima Gigas), a 100lb Barramundi (Lates Calcarifer) in India, a 400lb-plus Goliath Grouper (Epinephelus Itajara) in Florida, a 100lb Giant Trevally (Caranx Ignobilis) in the South Pacific and a 200lb-plus Wels Catfish (Silurus Glanis) in Spain.

Martian gullies are small, incised networks of narrow channels and their associated downslope sediment deposits, found on the planet of Mars. They are named for their resemblance to terrestrial gullies. First discovered on images from Mars Global Surveyor, they occur on steep slopes, especially on the walls of craters. Usually, each gully has a dendritic alcove at its head, a fan-shaped apron at its base, and a single thread of incised channel linking the two, giving the whole gully an hourglass shape. They are estimated to be relatively young because they have few, if any craters. A subclass of gullies is also found cut into the faces of sand dunes, that are themselves considered to be quite young. Linear dune gullies are now considered recurrent seasonnal afeatures. Most gullies occur 30 degrees poleward in each hemisphere, with greater numbers in the southern hemisphere. Some studies have found that gullies occur on slopes that face all directions; others have found that the greater number of gullies are found on poleward facing slopes, especially from 30¬∞ to 44¬∞ S. Although thousands have been found, they appear to be restricted to only certain areas of the planet. In the northern hemisphere, they have been found in Arcadia Planitia, Tempe Terra, Acidalia Planitia, and Utopia Planitia. In the south, high concentrations are found on the northern edge of Argyre basin, in northern Noachis Terra, and along the walls of the Hellas outflow channels. A recent study examined 54,040 CTX images that covered 85% of the Martian surface found 4861 separate gullied landforms (e.g., individual craters, mounds, valleys, etc.), which totaled tens of thousands of individual gullies. It is estimated that CTX can resolve 95% of gullies.Harrison, T., G. Osinski1, and L. Tornabene. 2014. GLOBAL DOCUMENTATION OF GULLIES WITH THE MARS RECONNAISSANCE ORBITER CONTEXT CAMERA (CTX) AND IMPLICATIONS FOR THEIR FORMATION. 45th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference. pdf This article gives a history of the discovery and research on gullies. As research progresses, the cause of Martian gullies has shifted from recent liquid water to pieces of dry ice moving down steep slopes, but research continues. On the basis of their form, aspects, positions, and location amongst and apparent interaction with features thought to be rich in water ice, many researchers think that the processes carving the gullies involve liquid water.Luu, K., et al. 2018.

INSIGHTS INTO THE FORMATION OF GULLIES IN ASIMOV CRATER, MARS. 49th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference 2018 (LPI Contrib. No. 2083). 2889.pdf However, this remains a topic of active research. Because the gullies are so young, this would suggest that liquid water has been present on Mars in its very recent geological past, with consequences for the potential habitability of the modern surface. On July 10, 2014, NASA reported that gullies on the surface of Mars were mostly formed by the seasonal freezing of carbon dioxide (CO2), and not by that of liquid water as considered earlier. Formation Group of gullies on north wall of crater that lies west of the crater Newton. The alcove and apron of one gully are labelled. These gullies are associated with moraine-like ridges at their downslope ends, which suggests they have formed at the site of a now-absent flowing ice. Note that they are cut into a mantle, which is much smoother than the rough-textured underlying material. Image taken by Mars Global Surveyor. After being discovered, many hypotheses were put forward to explain the gullies.http://www.psrd.hawaii.edu/Aug03/MartianGullies.html However, as in the usual progression of science, some ideas came to be more plausible than others when more observations were made, when other instruments were used, and when statistical analysis was employed. Even though some gullies resembled debris flows on Earth, it was found that many gullies were on slopes that were not steep enough for typical debris flows. Calculations showed that the pressure and temperatures were not right for liquid carbon dioxide. Moreover, the winding shape of the gullies suggested that the flows were slower than what would be produced in debris flows or eruptions of liquid carbon dioxide. Liquid carbon dioxide would explode out of the ground in the thin Martian atmosphere. Because the liquid carbon dioxide would throw material over 100 meters, the channels should be discontinuous, but they are not. Eventually, most hypotheses were narrowed to involve liquid water coming from an aquifer, from melting at the base of old glaciers (or snowpacks), or from the melting of ice in the ground when the climate was warmer.Forget, F. et al. 2006. Planet Mars Story of Another World. Praxis Publishing. Chichester, UK. Close- up images with HiRISE showed details that support the idea that a fluid was involved. Images show that channels were formed a number of times. Smaller channels were found in larger valleys, suggesting that after a valley formed another formed at a later time. Many cases showed channels took different paths at different times. Streamlined forms like teadrop-shaped islands were common in some channels.Head, J., D. Marchant, M. Kreslavsky. 2008. Formation of gullies on Mars: Link to recent climate history and insolation microenvironments implicate surface water flow origin. PNAS: 105 (36), 13258‚Äì13263. The following group of pictures of gullies illustrate some of the shapes that lead researchers to think that water was involved in creating at least some of the gullies.

Note: this is an enlargement of the previous image by HiRISE under HiWish program. Location is Eridania quadrangle. However, more studies open up other possibilities; a study released in October 2010, proposes that some gullies, the ones on sand dunes, may be produced by a buildup of solid carbon dioxide during cold winter months.NASA/Jet Propulsion Laboratory. \\"Study links fresh Mars gullies to carbon dioxide.\\" ScienceDaily 30 October 2010. 10 March 2011 On July 10, 2014, NASA reported that gullies on the surface of Mars were mostly formed by the seasonal freezing of carbon dioxide (CO2 ice or 'dry ice'), and not by that of liquid water as thought earlier. The exact cause/causes of these gullies is still under debate. A study supported formation by the melting of ground ice or snowpack as the chief cause. Over 54,000 CTX images were examined which covered about 85% of the surface of the planet.Harrison, T., G. Osinski, L. Tornabene, E. Jones. 2015. Global documentation of gullies with the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter Context Camera and implications for their formation. Icarus: 252, 236‚Äì254. Aquifers Most of the gully alcove heads occur at the same level, just as one would expect if water came out of an aquifer. Various measurements and calculations show that liquid water could exist in aquifers at the usual depths where gullies begin. One variation of this model is that rising hot magma could have melted ice in the ground and caused water to flow in aquifers. Aquifers are layers that allow water to flow. They may consist of porous sandstone. The aquifer layer would be perched on top of another layer that prevents water from going down (in geological terms it would be called impermeable). Because water in an aquifer is prevented from going down, the only direction the trapped water can flow is horizontally. Eventually, water could flow out onto the surface when the aquifer reaches a break‚Äîlike a crater wall. The resulting flow of water could erode the wall to create gullies.Mars Gullies Likely Formed By Underground Aquifers. Leonard David, 12 November 2004 (Space.com) Aquifers are quite common on Earth. A good example is \\"Weeping Rock\\" in Zion National Park Utah.Harris, A and E. Tuttle. 1990. Geology of National Parks. Kendall/Hunt Publishing Company. Dubuque, Iowa However, the idea that aquifers formed the gullies does not explain the ones found on isolated peaks, like knobs and the central peaks of craters. Also, a type of gully seems to be present on sand dunes. Aquifers need a wide collecting area which is not present on sand dunes or on isolated slopes. Even though most of the original gullies that were seen seemed to come from the same layer in the slope, some exceptions to this pattern have been found.Foget, F. et al. 2006. Planet Mars Story of Another World. Praxis Publishing. Chichester, UK Examples of gullies coming from different levels is shown below in the image of Lohse Crater and the image of gullies in Ross Crater. Image:Wide view of gully on hill.JPGCTX image of the next image showing a wide view of the area. Since the hill is isolated it would be difficult for an aquifer to develop. Rectangle shows the approximate location of the next image. Image:Gully on mound.JPGGully on mound as seen by Mars Global Surveyor, under the MOC Public Targeting Program. Images of gullies on isolated peaks, like this one, are difficult to explain with the theory of water coming from aquifers because aquifers need large collecting areas. Image:Context for Gullies in Ross crater.jpgCTX image of part of Ross Crater showing context for next image from HiRISE. Image:Gullies in Ross Crater.JPGGullies in Ross Crater, as seen by HiRISE under the HiWish program. Because the gullies are on the narrow rim of a crater and they start at different heights, this example is not consistent with the model of gullies being caused by aquifers. ESP 039621 1315gullies2levels.jpgGullies in two levels of a crater wall, as seen by HiRISE under HiWish program. Gullies at two levels suggests they were not made with an aquifer, as was first suggested. Location is Phaethontis quadrangle. Image:Lohse Crater.JPGLohse Crater Gullies on Central Peak. Image located in Argyre quadrangle. Having gullies on a central peak runs counter to the idea that they were formed by an aquifer, as was first suggested. Snowpacks As for the next theory, much of the surface of Mars is covered by a thick smooth mantle that is thought to be a mixture of ice and dust. This ice-rich mantle, a few yards thick, smoothes the land, but in places it has a bumpy texture, resembling the surface of a basketball. The mantle may be like a glacier and under certain conditions the ice that is mixed in the mantle could melt and flow down the slopes and make gullies.Martian gullies could be scientific gold mines. Leonard David, 11/13/2006. Calculations show that a third of a mm of runoff can be produced each day for 50 days of each Martian year even under current conditions. Because there are few craters on this mantle, the mantle is relatively young. An excellent view of this mantle is shown below in the picture of the Ptolemaeus Crater Rim, as seen by HiRISE. The ice-rich mantle may be the result of climate changes.Melting Snow Created Mars Gullies, Expert Says Changes in Mars's orbit and tilt cause significant changes in the distribution of water ice from polar regions down to latitudes equivalent to Texas. During certain climate periods water vapor leaves polar ice and enters the atmosphere. The water comes back to ground at lower latitudes as deposits of frost or snow mixed generously with dust. The atmosphere of Mars contains a great deal of fine dust particles. Water vapor will condense on the particles, then fall down to the ground due to the additional weight of the water coating. When Mars is at its greatest tilt or obliquity, up to 2 cm of ice could be removed from the summer ice cap and be deposited at midlatitudes. This movement of water could last for several thousand years and create a snow layer of up to around 10 meters thick. When ice at the top of the mantling layer goes back into the atmosphere, it leaves behind dust, which insulates the remaining ice. When the slopes, orientations, and elevations of thousands of gullies were compared, clear patterns emerged from the data. Measurements of altitudes and slopes of gullies support the idea that snowpacks or glaciers are associated with gullies. Steeper slopes have more shade which would preserve snow. Higher elevations have far fewer gullies because ice would tend to sublimate more in the thin air of the higher altitude. For example, Thaumasia quadrangle is heavily cratered with many steep slopes. It is in the right latitude range, but its altitude is so high that there is not enough pressure to keep ice from sublimating (going directly from a solid to a gas); hence it does not have gullies. A large study done with several years worth of data from Mars Global Surveyor showed that there is a tendency for gullies to be on poleward facing slopes; these slopes have more shade that would keep snow from melting and allow large snowpacks to accumulate. In general, it is now estimated that during periods of high obliquity, the ice caps will melt causing higher temperature, pressure, and moisture. The moisture will then accumulate as snow in midlatitudes, especially in the more shaded areas‚Äîpole facing, steep slopes. At a certain time of the year, sunlight will melt snow with the resulting water producing gullies. Melting of ground ice The third theory might be possible since climate changes may be enough to simply allow ice in the ground to melt and thus form the gullies. During a warmer climate, the first few meters of ground could thaw and produce a \\"debris flow\\" similar to those on the dry and cold Greenland east coast. Since the gullies occur on steep slopes only a small decrease of the shear strength of the soil particles is needed to begin the flow. Small amounts of liquid water from melted ground ice could be enough. Recent changes in gullies As soon as gullies were discovered, researchers began to image many gullies over and over, looking for possible changes. By 2006, some changes were found. Later, with further analysis it was determined that the changes could have occurred by dry granular flows rather than being driven by flowing water. With continued observations many more changes were found in Gasa Crater and others.NASA/Jet Propulsion Laboratory. \\"NASA orbiter finds new gully channel on Mars.\\" ScienceDaily. ScienceDaily, 22 March 2014. . Channels widened by 0.5 to 1 m; meter sized boulders moved; and hundreds of cubic meters of material moved. It was calculated that gullies could be formed under present conditions with as little as 1 event in 50‚Äì500 years. So, although today there is little liquid water, present geological/climatic processes could still form gullies.Dundas, C., S. Diniega, and A. McEwen. 2014. LONG-TERM MONITORING OF MARTIAN GULLY ACTIVITY WITH HIRISE. 45th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference. 2204.pdf Large amounts of water or great changes in climate are not needed. However, some gullies in the past may have been aided by weather changes that involved larger amounts of water, perhaps from melted snow.Dundas, C., S. Diniega, C. Hansen, S. Byrne, A. McEwen. 2012. Seasonal activity and morphological changes in martian gullies. Icarus, 220. 124‚Äì143. With more repeated observations, more and more changes have been found; since the changes occur in the winter and spring, experts are tending to suspect that gullies were formed from carbon dioxide ice (dry ice). Recent studies describe using the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) camera on MRO to examine gullies at 356 sites, starting in 2006. Thirty-eight of the sites showed active gully formation. Before-and-after images demonstrated the timing of this activity coincided with seasonal carbon dioxide frost and temperatures that would not have allowed for liquid water. When dry ice frost changes to a gas, it may lubricate dry material to flow especially on steep slopes.http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2014-226http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_032078_1420http://www.space.com/26534-mars- gullies-dry-ice.html In some years frost, perhaps as thick as 1 meter, triggers avalanches. This frost contains mostly dry ice, but also has tiny amounts of water ice.http://spaceref.com/mars/frosty-gullies-on-mars.html Observations with HiRISE show widespread activity in southern hemisphere gullies, especially in those that appear fresh.

These observations support a model in which currently active gully formation is driven mainly by seasonal CO2 frost. Simulations described in a 2015 conference, show that high pressure CO2 gas trapping in the subsurface can cause debris flows.http://www.uahirise.org/ESP_044327_1375 The conditions that can lead to this are found in latitudes where gullies occur.C. Pilorget, C., F. Forget. 2015. \\"CO2 Driven Formation of Gullies on Mars.\\" 46th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference. 2471.pdf This research was described in a later article entitled, \\"Formation of gullies on Mars by debris flows triggered by CO2 sublimation.\\" In the model, CO2 ice accumulates in the cold winter. It piles up on a frozen permafrost layer that consists of ice-cemented dirt. When the higher intensity sunlight of spring begins, light penetrates the translucent dry ice layer, consequently warming the ground. The CO2 ice absorbs heat and sublimates‚Äîthat is changes directly from a solid to a gas. This gas builds up pressure because it is trapped between the ice and the frozen ground. Eventually, pressure builds up enough to explode through the ice taking with it soil particles. The dirt particles mix with the pressurized gas and act as a fluid that can flow down the slope and carve gullies.CNRS. \\"Gullies on Mars sculpted by dry ice rather than liquid water.\\" ScienceDaily. ScienceDaily, 22 December 2015. . Using data from the Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars (CRISM) and High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter researchers studied over 100 Martian gully sites and found no evidence for specific minerals being more likely to be associated with gullies, or with the formation of hydrated minerals that would have been made by recent liquid water. This research adds evidence that liquid water was not involved with gully formation.http://spaceref.com/mars/todays-gullies-on-mars-are-probably-not- formed-by-liquid-water.html Some researchers believe that gully formation may involve both dry ice and liquid water.M. Vincendon (2015) JGR, 120, 1859‚Äì1879.Dundas, C. 2016. Nat. Geosci, 9, 10‚Äì11S. J. Conway, J., et al. 2016. MARTIAN GULLY ORIENTATION AND SLOPE USED TO TEST MELTWATER AND CARBON DIOXIDE HYPOTHESES. 47th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference (2016). 1973.pdf How changing tilt affects the climate It is estimated that a few million years ago, the tilt of the axis of Mars was 45 degrees instead of its present 25 degrees. Its tilt, also called obliquity, varies greatly because its two tiny moons cannot stabilize it, like our relatively large moon does to the Earth. During such periods of high tilt, the summer rays of the sun strike the mid-latitude crater surfaces straight on, thus the surface remains dry. Image:Marssummersun.jpgThe straight on rays of the sun prevent snow from accumulating in mid-latitude craters when the tilt of Mars is high. Note that at high tilt, the ice caps at the poles disappear, the atmosphere thickness, and the moisture in the atmosphere goes up. These conditions cause snow and frost to appear on the surface. However, any snow that falls at night and during the cooler parts of the day disappears when the day warms. Things are quite different as fall approaches, for the pole-facing slopes remain in the shade all day. Shade causes snow to accumulate through the fall and winter seasons. Image:Mars fallsunt.jpgShade on the pole-facing wall of a mid- latitude crater promotes snow accumulation. Note the snow will be grey to black due to dust. Image:Winterhightiltmars.jpgBy winter a large mass of snow has accumulated in the pole-facing pole of a crater. As the seasons warm, this snow deposit will melt to produce gullies. In the spring at certain point, the ground will be warm enough and the air pressure high enough for liquid water to form at certain times of the day. There may be sufficient water to produce gullies by erosion. Or, the water may soak into the ground, and later move down as a debris flow. Gullies on Earth formed by this process resemble Martian gullies. The great changes in the tilt of Mars explain both the strong relationship of gullies to certain latitude bands and the fact that the vast majority of gullies exist on shady, pole-facing slopes. Models support the idea that pressure/temperature changes during high obliquity times are enough to allow liquid water to be stable in places where gullies are common. Research published in January 2015 suggests that these seasonal changes could have happened within the last two million years (between 400,000 and two million years ago) creating conditions suitable for formation of the gullies through ice melt. Sharp-featured recent gullies (blue arrows) and older degraded gullies (gold) in the same location on Mars. These suggest cyclical climate change within the last two million years Associated features of gullies Some steep slopes show other features in addition to gullies. At the base of some gullies there may be curved ridges or depressions. These have been named \\"spatulate depressions.\\" Along walls, like crater walls, ice often accumulates during certain phases of the Martian climate cycle. When the climate changes, this ice can sublimate into the thin Martian atmosphere. Sublimation is when a substance goes directly from a solid state to a gas state. Dry ice on Earth does this. So when the ice at the base of a steep wall sublimates, a spatulate depression results. Also, more ice from higher up the wall will tend to flow downward. This flow will stretch the surface rocky debris thereby forming transverse crevasses. Such formations have been termed \\"washboard terrain\\" because they resemble the old fashioned washboards.Jawin, E, J. Head, D. Marchant. 2018.

Gullies on dunes Gullies are found on some dunes. These are somewhat different than gullies in other places, like the walls of craters. Gullies on dunes seem to keep the same width for a long distance and often just end with a pit, instead of an apron. They are often just a few meters across with raised banks along the sides.https://scitechdaily.com/linear-gullies-on-mars-caused-by-sliding-dry- ice/Dundas, C., et al. 2012. Seasonal activity and morphological changes in martian gullies. Icarus: 220, 124-143. Many of these gullies are found on dunes in Russell (Martian crater). In the winter dry ice accumulates on the dunes and then in the spring dark spots appear and dark-toned streaks grow downhill. After the dry ice is gone, new channels are visible. These gullies may be caused by blocks of dry ice moving down the steep slope or perhaps from dry ice starts the sand moving.https://www.uahirise.org/ESP_051770_1345McEwen, A., et al. 2017.

Probably built in the 1770s, it is one of the oldest surviving buildings in Knox County. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1969. Description The Conway House stands near the southern border of Camden and the northern border of Rockport, on the northwest side of United States Route 1 between it and Conway Road. Its access road is on US 1. The house is a 1-1/2 story Cape style wood frame structure, four bays wide, with a central chimney. It was apparently built on the foundation of an older house, possibly dating to the early 18th century. The timber framing of the house is rough, with tree bark evident on some of its beams, and axe and adze markings on the beams and some trim elements. History Conway House was built around 1770 by Robert Thorndike, the first White settler in Camden. Thorndike's son Robert Jr. was born in the house in 1773, who was one of the first White children born in the area. He bought the lot for $65 and lived in the home until 1825, when Frederick Conway bought the home. It stayed in the Conway family until 1916. It was the home of US Navy quartermaster William Conway. By 1961, the property was in rundown condition and was purchased by Ambrose Cramer and donated to the Camden-Rockport Historical Society, who subsequently restored and furnished the building with 18th and early 19th century items. It was opened to the public as a museum in 1962. The Camden Garden Club landscaped the property and restored the plants common to the area prior to 1860.Camden-Rockport Historical Society Conway Homestead & Cramer Museum Today the Camden-Rockport Historical Society operates the museum as the Conway Homestead & Cramer Museum. The property includes the Conway House, the Cramer Museum with displays from the Society's collections of local historic artifacts, a barn with a display of carriages, sleighs and tools, a blacksmith shop, a maple sugaring house, and an education center.

It was originally formed in 1915 during the First World War as part of the all- volunteer Australian Imperial Force (AIF) and saw service on the Western Front before being disbanded in 1919. It was re-raised in 1921 but was later amalgamated with the 51st Battalion in 1930. In 1935 the two battalions were delinked and the 30th re-raised in its own right. During the Second World War it undertook garrison duties in Australia before undertaking active service in New Guinea in 1944‚Äì1945. After the war, it was disbanded in early 1946. In 1948, the battalion was re-raised again and remained on the order of battle until 1960 when it was absorbed into the Royal New South Wales Regiment. History=First World War The 30th Battalion was originally raised for service as an Australian Imperial Force (AIF) unit during the First World War, as part of the 8th Brigade. Formed in Australia in early August 1915, the battalion concentrated at Liverpool, New South Wales and drew most of its personnel from various parts of New South Wales, with a large contingent coming from Newcastle, although one company was formed from Victorian men who had volunteered to transfer from the Royal Australian Navy to serve in the infantry. Upon the battalion's arrival in Egypt, the 8th Brigade had been unattached at divisional level, but in early 1916, it was assigned to the 5th Division, after a reorganisation that saw the AIF expanded from two infantry divisions to five... The battalion was not formed in time to see action at Gallipoli and instead they remained in Egypt until June 1916 when the battalion was transferred to the European theatre along with the rest of the 5th Division. For the next two and half years they served in the trenches along the Western Front in France and Belgium. The battalion's first major action came at Fromelles on 19 July 1916 where they were initially tasked to provide a supporting role, carrying ammunition to the assault troops, but they were later committed to the fighting as the situation deteriorated for the Australians. After the battle, the 30th were employed in mainly defensive duties holding parts of the line for the rest of 1916. In early 1917, after the Germans withdrew to the Hindenburg Line to shorten their lines, the Australian units conducted a brief advance to follow them up, during which the 30th entered Bapaume. After this, for the remainder of the year the battalion had a relatively quiet time but nevertheless took part in two main engagements‚ÄîBullecourt and Polygon Wood‚Äîwhere they were employed mainly in flank protection. When the Germans launched their Spring Offensive in early 1918, the 30th found itself in reserve for the majority of the time along with the rest of the 5th Division. Once the offensive was defeated, a brief lull followed in June and July during which the Allies sought to regain the initiative, launching a series of \\"Peaceful Penetration\\" operations;. at this time, the 30th undertook a number of raids around Morlancourt before conducting an attack there on 29 July. On 8 August, they joined the Allied Hundred Days Offensive that was launched at Amiens on 8 August 1918, spearheading the 5th Division's attack up the Morcourt Valley. A series of advances followed as the Allies gained momentum, pushing their way through the Hindenburg Line defences around the Somme. The 30th's final involvement in the fighting came in late September ‚Äì early October 1918 when they took part in the Battle of St. Quentin Canal, which saw a joint Australian and American force breach the Hindenburg Line. Following this, the units of the Australian Corps, which had been severely depleted during the fighting in 1918, were withdrawn from the line for rest and re-organisation at the request of the Australian prime minister, Billy Hughes.. As a result, they were still out of the line when the Armistice was declared on 11 November 1918. Following this the demobilisation process began and slowly the battalion's numbers were reduced as men were repatriated back to Australia in drafts. Finally, in March 1919, the 30th Battalion was disbanded. During the war the 30th Battalion‚Äôs casualties amounted to 458 men killed and 1,207 wounded. Members of the battalion received the following gallantry and distinguished service decorations: six Distinguished Service Orders (DSOs), one Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE), 19 Military Crosses (MCs), 15 Distinguished Conduct Medals (DCMs); 84 Military Medals (MMs) with three Bars, four Meritorious Service Medals (MSMs); 30 Mentions in Despatches (MIDs) and four foreign awards. The battalion received a total of 16 battle honours for its involvement in the war; these were bestowed in 1927. Inter-war years 30th Battalion at the Highland Gathering, at the Sydney Showground, January 1939 The battalion was re-raised as part of the Citizens Force, based around Sydney, New South Wales, as the Army undertook a reorganisation designed to perpetuate the battle honours and numerical designations of the AIF in 1921.. At this time the 30th Battalion was reformed from elements drawn from two Citizens Forces battalions: the 2nd Battalion, 4th Infantry Regiment and the 2nd Battalion, 30th Infantry Regiment. These units were able to trace their lineage back to the 25th Infantry Regiment and beyond that to the New South Wales Scottish Rifles, which had been formed in 1885 and had provided personnel to serve during the Boer War, for which they had received the \\"South Africa 1899‚Äì1902\\" battle honour. Upon formation, the battalion was once again assigned to the 8th Brigade, within the 2nd Military District. In 1927, territorial designations were introduced and the 30th Battalion adopted the title of the \\"City of Sydney Regiment\\". The battalion's motto ‚Äì In Ommi Modo Fidelis ‚Äì was also authorised at this time. Two years later, in 1929‚Äì30, as a result of the economic hardships of the Great Depression and the manpower shortage that resulted from the decision to suspend the compulsory training scheme, the number of personnel available fell and it was decided to amalgamate a number of infantry battalions.. As a result, in 1930 the 30th Battalion was amalgamated with the 51st Battalion to form the 30th/51st Battalion. In 1935, the two battalions were split once more and the 30th Battalion was re-raised. In order to maintain the Scottish heritage of the battalion's predecessor units, the 30th Battalion adopted the designation of the New South Wales Scottish Regiment at this time. It was also issued with Scottish military equipment including kilts, and adopted the tartan of the Black Watch, a Scottish unit of the British Army. Second World War Because the provisions of the Defence Act (1903) prohibited sending the Militia to fight outside of Australian territory, at the outset of the Second World War the Australian government decided to raise an all-volunteer force, known as the Second Australian Imperial Force (2nd AIF), for service overseas.. While the Militia would provide a core of experienced personnel from which to recruit this force, their main role was to improve the nation's level of military preparedness by managing and administering the training of conscripts following the re-introduction of the compulsory training scheme in January 1940.. In order to meet this requirement, Militia units were progressively called up to undertake brief periods of continuous service throughout 1940 and 1941. At this time, the 30th Battalion was again attached to the 8th Brigade and undertook garrison duties in New South Wales. In March 1942, the 30th Battalion occupied defensive positions in North Sydney including beach defences to respond to possible Japanese landings at Manly, Freshwater Beach, and Curl Curl. Later the 30th was sent to Greta, where it concentrated with the rest of the 8th Brigade before being transferred to Western Australia. The 30th Battalion remained there until late 1943 when they were moved to Queensland to undertake training for possible deployment overseas. In early 1944, the units of the 8th Brigade were dispatched to New Guinea in support of the 9th Division which was taking part in the Huon Peninsula campaign. During this time, the 30th Battalion's most notable involvement came during the Battle of Sio. Further operations saw the battalion advance along the coast and occupy Madang and Alexishafen, before returning to garrison duties in the Madang‚ÄìHansa Bay area following the completion of the campaign. Later, in June 1945, the 30th Battalion was moved to Wewak where they provided a supporting role to the 6th Division‚Äôs campaign, conducting patrols around Mount Tazaki and Mount Shiburangu. During this time they were involved in a number of minor engagements with Japanese forces in the area, with the most notable coming in July when the battalion helped repel a Japanese attack on Australian positions around Mount Tazaki. Following the end of hostilities, the battalion was disbanded at Chermside, Queensland in March 1946. 21 men from the 30th Battalion were killed in action or died on active service during the war, while another 20 men were wounded. The following decorations were bestowed upon members of the 30th Battalion for their service during the war: one Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE), one MC, one British Empire Medal (BEM), three MMs and 14 MIDs. Post war By 1948 the demobilisation of Australia's wartime army had been completed. At this time the decision was made to re-raise the part-time military forces‚Äîthis time under the guise of the Citizens Military Force (CMF)‚Äîand on a reduced establishment of just two complete divisions.. The 30th Battalion was re-raised at this time, and was entrusted as custodian of the battle honours of the 2/30th Battalion, the 2nd AIF unit with which they were associated. Initially service in the post-war CMF was on a voluntary basis. In 1951, however, the compulsory training scheme was reintroduced and as a result the size of many CMF units swelled;. nevertheless, the scheme was suspended in 1959. and this led to a significant decrease in the strength of many units. The following year, the Army introduced the Pentropic divisional structure and a wide-reaching re-organisation of the CMF structure was undertaken that saw a number of infantry battalions amalgamated or disbanded altogether as the regionally based single battalion regiments were replaced by six new multi- battalion State-based regiments.. As part of this change, the 30th Battalion was reduced to a company-level organisation within the Pentropic 2nd Battalion, Royal New South Wales Regiment, forming 'A' Company (The New South Wales Scottish Company). Highland Laddie was approved as the battalion's regimental march in 1953 and in 1961 the battalion was awarded its Second World War battle honours, receiving four for their direct involvement in the conflict. At the same they were also entrusted with the four battle honours that the 2/30th Battalion received for its involvement in the fighting in Malaya and Singapore. In 1965, the Australian Army's experiment with the Pentropic structure was abandoned and the CMF was once again reorganised. This reorganisation saw many of the Pentropic battalions, including the 2nd Battalion, Royal New South Wales Regiment, being once again split to form additional battalions.. The 30th Battalion, however, was not re-raised at this time. The Queen's and Regimental Colours of the 30th Battalion were laid up and are on display at St Stephen's Uniting Church, Sydney.

WILA was formed at the beginning of the 2010‚Äì2011 academic year in order to name a champion (which does not involve a tournament), players of the week, and an all-league team at the end of the season. With no automatic qualifiers (AQ) currently in NCAA Division II men's lacrosse, conferences play a different role than in Division III. The WILA is a loose confederation that not only assures games for its members, but also hopes to act as a catalyst for other NCAA Division II institutions looking to make a move to varsity lacrosse and eyeing stability. \\"It's what you need to do in non-traditional areas,\\" said Notre Dame de Namur men's lacrosse coach Steve Dini. The WILA schedule features home-and-home contests with all schools. The 2010‚Äì2011 season included Adams State, Fort Lewis, Colorado Mesa and Regis competing in women's lacrosse, while Adams State, Dominican, Grand Canyon, Colorado Mesa and Notre Dame de Namur competed in men's lacrosse. Lindenwood University joins the conference beginning with the 2011‚Äì2012 academic year with both men's and women's teams. They replaced Grand Canyon University, which left the conference at the end of the 2010‚Äì2011 season, after the university announced that their program would compete at the club level in the Men's Collegiate Lacrosse Association. The WILA concluded its second season in April 2012. Colorado Mesa won the association's men's championship with a conference record of 6-2; the championship was the first for Colorado Mesa in the program's second year of NCAA lacrosse competition. On the women's side, Lindenwood won the 2012 WILA women's lacrosse championship in the program's first season of NCAA competition. The Lady Lions recorded an 8-0 conference record en route to the title. The season saw additional membership changes when Lindenwood announced its men's program would join the new ECAC Division II Lacrosse League starting in the 2012‚Äì2013 academic year. The announcement was followed a week later by the addition of McKendree University's new women's lacrosse program starting in the 2012‚Äì2013 academic year. Men's lacrosse was added as an official Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference sport starting in the 2015‚Äì2016 school year, essentially absorbing the WILA.

History Longstanding poverty in this rural community meant that many residents had to rely on charity from Christian organizations. Around 1998 the leaders of the Town of Tutwiler decided to permit construction of a private prison in their jurisdiction, hoping it would provide jobs to area residents. Originally, the prison was planned to house Mississippi state prisoners as well as others from other states. To help facilitate construction of the prison, the Town of Tutwiler constructed a sewage lagoon and a water tower for infrastructure. The State of Mississippi and Tallahatchie County paid half of the cost to train correctional officers for the new prison, in order to support improving the local economy.Kilborn, Peter T. \\"Delta Town's Hopes Are as Scarce as Inmates.\\" The New York Times.

He is said to have received some architectural training from a local architect This is likely to have been William Lumby, a Lincoln architect, who was also the Cathedral surveyor.E. J. Willson Lincolnshire Collection in the Society of Antiquaries Organcase, Lincoln Cathedral designed by Willson By 1817 Willson had established himself as an architect when he was engaged by Archdeacon Henry Vincent Bayley in the restoration of Messingham church. This was followed by his superintendence repairs or restorations of churches at Haxey, Louth, West Rasen, Saundby, Staunton, South WillinghamRebuilt tower and possibly the Nave of South Willingham Church , Lincolnshire Chronicle - Friday 02 November 1838 pg.2. and other churches in Lincolnshire and Nottinghamshire. He designed St John the Evangelist's Catholic Church, Nottingham and other Roman Catholic chapels at Hainton, Louth, Melton Mowbray, Grantham, and which are early examples of the Gothic revival. St Saviour, Retford (1829) His first major project was the Grade II listed St Saviour's Church, Moorgate, Retford, 1829, which was the first of four parish churches he designed. The building has largely survived intact. In 1826 he designed the organ case for Lincoln Cathedral. Following his appointment as Surveyor to the County Committee in 1833‚Äò‚ÄòColvin ‚Äú(1995) 1061 he was between 1834 and 1845 responsible for he restoration of the keep, towers, and walls of Lincoln Castle. The Pelham Column, 128 feet high, on a hill at Cabourne between Caistor and Grimsby, was designed by Willson for the Earl of Yarborough. He was honoured as a citizen in Lincoln, and became a city magistrate in 1834 and mayor in 1852. Family and pupils Willson died at Lincoln on 8 September 1854. He married, in 1821, Mary, daughter of Thomas Mould of Snarford and Hainton and who was related to the Heneage family.Obituary of Thomas John Willson By her he had two surviving sons. One of his sons Thomas John Willson (1824-1903) also became a successful architect in London, mainly building Roman Catholic churches.Brodie 1018-19 Edward Willson and his wife, who died the year before him, were both buried at Hainton. He trained Frederick James Jobson as an architect before the Jobson embarked on a career in the Methodist ministry. Jobson praised his works and writings as contributing to the Gothic Revival, particularly in Lincolnshire.F.J. Jobson, Chapel and School Architecture as Appropriate to the Buildings of Nonconformists Particularly to Those of the Wesleyan Methodists: With Practical Directions for the Erection of Chapels and School-Houses (London, 1850). Also the notable Pre-Raphaelite painter James Smetham was articled to Willson in the 1830s. York Herald - Saturday 11 March 1893, pg.12 Architectural history and local history The importance of Willson as an Architectural historian was recognised by Nikolaus Pevsner in 1972.Pevsner N (1972), Some Architectural Writers of the Nineteenth Century, Oxford Unvesity Press p.25. Initially, Willson had been collecting material for a history of Lincoln and Lincolnshire. This was published in 1816 with a dedication to Lady Monson, under the title The History of Lincoln; containing an account of the Antiquities, Edifices, Trade, and Customs, of that Ancient City; an introductory sketch of the County; and a description of the Cathedral. By 1818 he had supplied his friend John Britton with accounts of Lincoln Cathedral, Boston church, St. Peter's, Barton on Humber, and Beverley Minster for volume 5 of Britton‚ÄôsArchitectural Antiquities, although this volume was not published until 1826.Britton J. (1805-1826), Architectural Antiquities of Great Britain, 5 vols Willson also contributed to Britton‚Äôs Cathedral Antiquities (1814‚Äì35) and Picturesque Antiquities of English Cities (1830). As a result of his association with Britton Willson became a member of the Architects and Antiquaries Club in 1819. Amongst the members of the club was Augustus Charles PuginSweet R. (2004), Antiquaries; The Discovery of the Past in 18th century Britain Hambledon, London, pg. 267 This resulted in Willson writings the text to Specimens of Gothic Architecture, with illustrations by Pugin which was published in two volumes in 1821 and 1822. He then wrote jointly with Pugin Examples of Gothic Architecture, consisting of Plans, Sections Elevations and Details which was published in two volumes in 1830 and 1836. Following his death in 1854, John Britton wrote a lengthy obituary on the career and work of Willson, with an appraisal of numerous books written by him. This was published in the Builder.The Builder [London], Vol. xiii, 6 January 1855, p. 4-5 The Lincolnshire Topographical Society Willson appears to have been the moving spirit behind the Lincolnshire Topographical Society, a learned society which took a particular interest in archaeology and architectural history. The only publication of the Topographical Society, appeared in 1843, indicates that the Society was probably formed in 1840 and Willson gave the introductory address on 23 February 1841.A selection of papers relative to the County of Lincoln, read before the Lincolnshire Topographical Society, 1841-1842, Lincoln 1843. Willson outlined a wide-ranging number of objectives for the Society, mentioning that it should follow the example of a Topographical Society recently formed in Wiltshire, presumably by his friend John Britton. In 1843 there were 69 members of society many of whom were of considerable note, including the mathematicians George Boole and Sir Edward Bromhead. Other local architects were well represented including William Adams Nicholson, Henry Goddard, James Sandby Padley and John Langwith of Grantham. However, either in 1844 or 1845 the Society faded out, but it was a precursor to the Lincolnshire Diocesan Architectural Society, which moved to Lincoln in 1856, and from which the Society for Lincolnshire History and Archaeology is directly descended. Archaeological and antiquarian collections During his lifetime Willson built up a very notable collection of Lincolnshire antiquities and items connected with Lincolnshire History. Shortly after his death in 1854, a printed Catalogue of the extensive and valuable collection of books, prints, paintings, ancient and medieval remains, antique porcelain, household furniture and other effects of the late Edward James Willson was prepared.Printed by W & B Brooke - Lincolnshire Archives Reference Name R Box L.017.3 CAT It is assumed that many of his possessions were disposed of at this time and the bulk of his notable collection of archaeological finds were acquired by the Duke of Northumberland and are now on display in the Museum at Alnwick Castle. It may also be at this time that the Lincoln Cathedral Library obtained three folio volumes of monochrome drawings: City and County. Churches, Ruins, Fragments, Miscellaneous Antiquities, Views of Ancient Buildings in Lincoln by R. Cattermole, A. Pugin, F. J. Dobson and others, and The Works Chantry, the Vicars‚Äô College, and outbuildings, the Chancery, the Deanery, Surveys, drawings, notes. The latter consist of medieval and some post-medieval buildings with scale plans, details and mouldings. However, there was a further sale of his manuscripts and drawings at Sotheby's in 1888Sotheby, Wilkinson and Hodge, Sale Catalogue, 30th May 1888, pp16-32 The greater part of these papers, contained in 31 volumes or albums and 3 portfolios, were acquired by the Society of Antiquaries of London, and microfilm copies of these are also available at the Lincolnshire Record Office.Lincolnshire Record Office, Archivist's Report 1982-3, pp. 20-21 Architectural work St.Mary's church, Welton, Lincs Hainton Church - geograph.org.uk - 186087 Church restoration *Messingham.

The resolution was drafted by Turkey. Resolution=Observations In the preamble of the resolution, the Council reiterated its support for the eradication of international terrorism. It determined that the Afghan authorities were ultimately responsible for maintaining order in the country and the assistance provided by ISAF in this regard. The Council recognised that advances in areas relating to security, governance, human rights, law enforcement, development, anti-narcotics, anti-corruption and accountability were all linked. Furthermore, it recognised the support of the international community for a phased transition of responsibilities from NATO to the Afghan authorities, and the role of the international community in training and supporting the Afghan National Security Forces. The United Nations, through its Assistance Mission in the country, would play a role in promoting peace and security. Meanwhile, the Security Council was concerned about and condemned the increased violence and terrorism in the country by the Taliban, Al-Qaeda and other groups, as well as stronger links between terrorism and the illegal drug trade. It urged greater efforts by the Afghan government to tackle drug trafficking. There was also concern at the high number of civilian victims of the conflict, caused primarily by the Taliban, Al-Qaeda and other groups according to the Council, while progress was noted in reducing civilian casualties by ISAF and other international forces. Additionally, the Council expressed concern at the use and recruitment of child soldiers by the Taliban, and the use of civilians as human shields was strongly condemned. The Council acknowledged progress with security sector reform, though it determined that more progress was necessary with regard to impunity, strengthening judicial institutions, prison sector reform, human rights (particularly those of women and girls) and the rule of law. It also urged Afghan political parties to engage in political dialogue. Acts Acting under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, the authorisation given to ISAF to operate in Afghanistan was extended for an additional year, until October 13, 2011, with all states participating in the force authorised to use \\"all necessary measures\\" to fulfil its mandate. The Council requested further contributions towards ISAF in order for it to meet its operational requirements. Meanwhile, the resolution emphasised the importance of strengthening the Afghan security sector and urged troop-contributing countries to continue training Afghan security forces. It welcomed the increasing responsibility of the Afghan security forces with the aim of a self-sufficient and accountable security sector. Finally, the Security Council was to be kept informed on developments in Afghanistan through the ISAF leadership and the United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.

Plato is generally not regarded as the editor of all of Definitions. Some ancient scholars attributed Definitions to Speusippus.John Madison Cooper, D. S. Hutchinson (1997), Plato ‚Äì Complete Works. Hackett Publishing. pp. 1677‚Äì1687. In modern scholarship, Definitions is thought to have little philosophical value. Given the sophistication of Plato's and Aristotle's efforts in the area of definition, this collection seems to be an elementary text produced by second-rate philosophical study. Its early date, however, does give it some importance as a source for the history of ancient Platonism.Hans G√ºnter Zekl (ed.): Aristoteles: Organon, v. 2, Hamburg 1998, pp. LXIV, LXX‚ÄìLXXII.  Content  Definitions is a list of 184 terms important in early Platonism together with one or more brief definitions. Though not in alphabetical or any other simple order, it is possible to discern some features of the organization of the collection. Definitions 1‚Äì20 consist chiefly of terms from natural philosophy. Definitions 21‚Äì107, the main section of the collection, contain concepts from ethics (affects and virtues), political theory, logic, grammar, and epistemology. Definitions 108‚Äì184 are a final appendix that contains a mixture of concepts which sometimes duplicate earlier terms and therefore was probably added at a later date. There are few terms drawn from metaphysics. It is probable that the collection underwent changes through the centuries since the number of definitions in the surviving manuscripts varies.Luc Brisson: Platon: Dialogues douteux et apocryphes. In Richard Goulet (ed.): Dictionnaire des philosophes antiques, v. 5, part 1, Paris 2012, pp. 833‚Äì841: 839; Joseph Souilh√© (ed.): Platon: ≈íuvres compl√®tes, v. 13, part 3, 2nd edition, Paris 1962, p. 157ff. Methodologically, Definitions is related to the Platonic Method of Division (diairesis) that progresses from the more general to the more specific, i.e., from 'above' to 'below.' Definitions were constructed by first giving the genus of the thing to be defined and then giving more and more of its special characteristics (its differentia) until it was fully distinguished from other members of the genus. Such a definition therefore gives the lowest species for the thing defined. In Definitions, for example, the word definition is defined as an expression that is composed of genus and differentia.Definitions 415a. Many definitions in Definitions follow these principles and define terms by giving their genus and distinguishing characteristics. A human, for example, is a two-footed animal without wings.Definitions 415a. Here, two-footed animal is the lowest genus that contains humans and without wings distinguishes humans from all the other two- footed animals, i.e., from birds. Other definitions, however, consist only of lists of characteristics or are trivial explanations of words. Many concepts are defined simply by giving the distinguishing characteristic. Humans, for example, are also defined as the only rational animal.  Author and time of composition  There is a scholarly consensus that Definitions cannot be ascribed to Plato. However, many individual points rest on his doctrines and it is probable that the way of defining various concepts goes back to this teaching. It is thought certain that Definitions originated in the circles around the school of philosophy founded by Plato, i.e., in or around the Academy. The definitions were probably collected at the time of the Early Academy, and indeed in the period immediately following Plato's death, that is, in the second half of the fourth century or the first third of the third century BCE. Key Aristotelian terms such as 'potential' and 'actuality' are not conspicuous in Definitions. It was conjectured that Definitions is a selection from a larger collection that was available in the Academy in that period, and may have been the foundation of a lost collection made by Speusippus, Plato's nephew and the second head of the Academy.Hans Kr√§mer: Die √Ñltere Akademie. In Hellmut Flashar (ed.): Grundriss der Geschichte der Philosophie. Die Philosophie der Antike, v. 3, 2nd edition, Basel 2004, pp. 1‚Äì165: 96; Hans G√ºnter Zekl (ed.): Aristoteles: Organon, v. 2, Hamburg 1998, p. LXIX. Joseph Souilh√© (ed.) argues for a later date: Platon: ≈íuvres compl√®tes, v. 13, part 3, 2nd edition, Paris 1962, p. 157 ff.; cf. Margherita Isnardi: Nomos e basileia nell‚ÄôAccademia antica. In La Parola del Passato 12, 1957, pp. 401‚Äì438: p. 429 and note 2; Heinz Gerd Ingenkamp: Untersuchungen zu den pseudoplatonischen Definitionen, Wiesbaden 1967, pp. 106‚Äì110. Today, however, the hypothesis that the extant collection is related to Speusippus' is no longer defended.Leonardo Tar√°n: Speusippus of Athens, Leiden 1981, p. 197. Whether Definitions is a compilation made from older collections is debated by scholars.This is maintained by Heinz Gerd Ingenkamp: Untersuchungen zu den pseudoplatonischen Definitionen, Wiesbaden 1967, pp. 110‚Äì112. Konrad Gaiser rejects this in his review of von Ingenkamp's work in Gymnasium (newspaper) 76, 1969, pp. 543‚Äì546: 544 ff.  Reception  The existence of Definitions is first attested in the Roman imperial period. Until late antiquity, no one else but Plato was named as the author,Heinz Gerd Ingenkamp: Untersuchungen zu den pseudoplatonischen Definitionen, Wiesbaden 1967, p. 112 ff. but the prevailing opinion was that the collection did not originate with him. It was not included in the tetralogical arrangement of Plato's works. The anonymous Prolegomena to Platonic Philosophy, which is dated to late antiquity, designates Speusippus as the author.‚ÄûProlegomena zur Philosophie Platons‚Äú 26, ed. by Leendert G. Westerink: Prol√©gom√®nes √† la philosophie de Platon, Paris 1990, p. 38 ff. The earliest, surviving manuscript is from the ninth century CE.Joseph Souilh√© (ed.): Platon: ≈íuvres compl√®tes, v. 13, part 3, 2nd edition, Paris 1962, p. 158 ff. Definitions was unknown to the Latin- speaking, scholarly world of the Middle Ages and was first rediscovered by Renaissance humanists. In the fifteenth century, the humanist Marsilio Ficino believed the collection's author was Speusippus.For Ficino's hypothesis see Antonio Carlini: Alcune considerazioni sulla tradizione testuale degli scritti pseudoplatonici. In Klaus D√∂ring et al. (ed.): Pseudoplatonica, Stuttgart 2005, pp. 25‚Äì35: 31f; James Hankins: Plato in the Italian Renaissance, 3rd edition, Leiden 1994, p. 307. Ficino translated Definitions into Latin and published his translation in Venice in 1497 with Aldus Manutius, and named Speusippus as the author in the introduction.James Hankins: Plato in the Italian Renaissance, 3rd edition, Leiden 1994, p. 742 ff. The first edition of the Greek text was brought out in Venice by Aldus Manutius in September 1513 as part of the complete works of Plato edited by Markos Musuros.

Magazine was published from the beginning of 1942 until breakdown of the Independent State of Croatia in May 1945. Founding and breakdown Since the establishment of the Independent State of Croatia the leading Croatian dailies, have become; Hrvatski narod and Nova Hrvatska, the leading ideological weekly newspaper of general type was Spremnost. Other newspapers that are coming out then were; weekly humorous magazine ≈†ilo, newspapers Gospodarstvo (Economic Affairs), Hrvatski radnik, Plug, Plava revija, Hrvatska revija and Vienac. Newsmagazine Spremnost was initiated only when the Usta≈°a regime mastered the methods of total control of the press. The initiator and main organizer was Ivo Bogdan and chief editor was Tias Mortigjija (until 1944). In addition with Mortigjija and Bogdan, in magazine regularly publish articles on politics; Milivoj Magdiƒá, Saviƒá ≈†tedimlija and Ante Ciliga (since 1943). Magdiƒá was responsible for the critique of Marxism‚ÄìLeninism, ≈†tedimlija was some kind of specialist in Balkans issues, especially for the Chetnik movement, and Ciliga wrote about the Soviet Union (he was spent in Russia about 10 years). Other important collaborators were: Ljubomir Marakoviƒá (literature), Ton Smerdel, Radoslav Glava≈°, Albert Haler, Antun Barac and Mihovil Kombol. Overall Spremnost was a typical puppet news magazine of this time with a strong nationalistic note, - defended the policy of its sponsors, and critical writing about politics of Allies tried to show his politics as disastrous for Europe. Allies are generally portrayed as unnatural interest coalition of Jews, Freemasonry and Communists. Thus, to illustrate the Spremnost published on 13 September 1942.

He became a controversial figure in Norway after stating that the country is at war with Muslims and warning the Norwegian people with an 11 September happening on Norwegian soil. Since then, his media profile has risen following a series of statements regarding Norway, homosexuality and Islamism. He was formerly a Sharia student at the Islamic University of Madinah in Saudi Arabia, until he was deported from the country in 2011.  Early life and education  With a family background from Iraq, Mohammad was born in Manchester, England in 1986. His family migrated to Norway in 1989, and Mohammad settled with his family in Larvik. In September 2006, he legally changed his name to \\"Giovanni\\", the Italian equivalent to English \\"John\\" but claimed to mean \\"God is gracious\\". For unknown reasons, he reverted to his original name in January 2007. Mohammad started studying Islamic Sharia law at the Islamic University of Madinah in Saudi Arabia in September 2009. In March 2010, he was expelled from the university for being considered \\"politically active.\\" Mohammad however appealed the verdict, and was allowed to continue studying at the university. Upon Mohammad's arrival in Medina on 8 September 2011, he was arrested by Saudi authorities. According to Saudi police, his arrest came as a result of \\"information\\" from Norwegian authorities, although it was not clear what his charges were. He returned to Norway on 12 September 2011.  \\"Profetens Ummah\\" and later life = Muhammad cartoon demonstration  Mohammad became noted in the Norwegian public after holding a speech during an illegal demonstration of 3,000 Muslims in Oslo on 12 February 2010, against the newspaper Dagbladet after it had printed a cartoon depicting Muhammad as a pig writing the Quran in the context of illustrating a link by a user the newspaper criticised on the Norwegian Police Security Service's Facebook page. In his speech Mohammad proclaimed: \\"When will the Norwegian government and their media understand the serious matter of this? Perhaps not before it's too late. Perhaps not before we get an 11 September on Norwegian soil. This is not a threat, but a warning.\\" His speech was condemned by the Islamic Council Norway, and reportedly by \\"a wide aspect\\" of the Norwegian Muslim community. A demonstration of Muslims against Mohammad's comments resulted in nine people showing up, some of whom held posters protesting the publication of the cartoon.  The Syrian civil war  Mohammad traveled to Syria in 2012, to participate in the Syrian civil war. Although it did not become known publicly until October that year, when he posted a series of photographs on-line, with himself posing alongside armed jihadists. One month later, he posted a video on the YouTube-website, where he, armed with automatic weapons warned Norwegian authorities against \\"spreading lies\\". Authorities speculated that he was a part of at least 30 Norwegian Islamists volunteering in the war. Upon returning to Norway sometime during the winter of 2012, he continued being active in raising funds for the Islamist rebels, alongside members of Profetens Ummah. Controversies Mohammad responded to a question from the newspaper Klassekampen on 16 February 2009 about the stoning of a person in Somalia with: \\"As far as I know the person was homosexual, that was the punishment he deserved.\\" The remarks caused furore, and the Norwegian National Association for Lesbian and Gay Liberation called it \\"probably the most extreme we have heard in this country for many years\\" and filed a formal complaint with the police, requesting that they investigate the incident. On 5 November 2009, Mohammad stated on Facebook that infidels should be decapitated, and he also honored Osama Bin Laden and other notable Islamists. After the death of four Norwegian soldiers in Afghanistan, Mohyeldeen posted a message on his Facebook saying: \\"Allahu Akbar! Norwegian terrorists killed in Afghanistan! Alhamdulillah, praised be Allah, this will be celebrated!\\". When Mullah Krekar allegedly threatened two Kurds who had burnt a Koran with death in April 2010, Mohammad referred to it as \\"our uncle's FatwƒÅ.\\" On 10 September 2011, Klassekampen reported that Mohammad had published a video on YouTube, in which he fires an air rifle and shouts \\"Allahu Akbar!\\". The video was titled \\"Jihad Norge\\" (Jihad Norway). Legal issues On 17 February 2010, Mohammad was arrested and briefly detained by police in connection with alleged threats against journalists from the daily Dagbladet. He was questioned and formally charged before being released. Approximately 18 months after being deported from Saudi Arabia, he travelled to Tunisia, and was arrested by Tunisian security police at the airport in the capital Tunis, and after a three-hour interrogation, he was again deported. Mohammad was arrested by the Norwegian Police Security Service (PST) on 1 February 2012. The background was a hate video published on YouTube, in connection with an Islamist demonstration outside the Norwegian Parliament two weeks earlier, in which Mohammad participated together with Arfan Qadeer Bhatti. Mohammad and another 21-year- old Islamist were released on 3 February, although they were still under investigation. He was again arrested by heavily armed security police in May 2013, on suspicion of carrying a gun. He was later fined and released after signing a written promise to stay away from the capital Oslo during the Norwegian Constitution Day celebrations. After failing to pay the fine of NOK 12.000, the case subsequently went to court. On 21 August 2014, Mohammad along with Ubaydullah Hussain was named in a criminal complaint filed to the police prosecutor in Oslo by The Iraqi Society in Norway, an organisation representing Iraqis in Norway. The complaint was filed after Mohammad, on social media had praised the beheading of American journalist James Foley. Personal life Mohammad has not been registered with an occupation in Norway since mid-2009. He married his first wife in the spring of 2011, but the marriage ended in separation after three months.

The film, set in the world of horse racing, was based on the 1924 novel of the same name by the prolific Edgar Wallace. It is one of five films starring Miller which is not known to be extant, and is classed as \\"missing, believed lost\\". A sequel Thank Evans was released in 1938; it too is missing. The story was later adapted into a BBC television series Educated Evans in 1957. The film was made at Teddington Studios, with sets designed by Peter Proud. Plot Cockney racing tipster Evans (Miller) is asked by a nouveau riche and socially aspirant couple to train a racehorse they have bought. The couple know nothing about horse racing, but believe that ownership of a successful racehorse will be their entr√©e into the high society racing set. Evans does not own a stable, so the horse has to live with him and his two lodgers in an urban mews. He has to keep constantly on his toes, as circumstances continually threaten to reveal to the horse's owners the ramshackle conditions in which the animal is kept. Despite its less than ideal training environment, the horse turns out to have a natural talent and great racing potential. It does well in its outings, and is entered for a prestigious race. Shortly before the big day, disaster strikes when the horse is stolen. Evans has to track down and outwit the crooks, and manages to recover the horse in the nick of time. Feeling confident of the horse's chances, Evans places a substantial bet on it to win the race. In his excitement however, he makes a mistake and accidentally lays the bet on a no- hope nag at ridiculously long odds. The race turns out to be a sensation, with all the favourites including Evans' horse failing to finish for one reason or another. The hopeless carthorse Evans backed in error crosses the line first and he makes a huge financial profit.

This was Miller's seventh film, and it had previously been a commonly held opinion that the line in fast-talking patter which had made Miller a stage star did not necessarily translate effectively to the screen, particularly as Miller reportedly refuted any suggestion that he should try to slow down or moderate his delivery to better suit the cinema vernacular; however critics seemed to agree that on this occasion it worked very well. Kine Weekly termed the film \\"an excellent popular booking... already past the box-office post\\". McCarthy's Report agreed that \\"though a one man show, there is plenty of popular entertainment to be found in the dialogue, the animated racecourse scenes and many tricks of the trade\\". As one of the most favourably received of Miller's films in its day, Educated Evans is included on the British Film Institute's \\"75 Most Wanted\\" list of missing British feature films.

He continued his military service and was in the Judge Advocate General Branch of the Utah Army National Guard for 25 years. He retired in 2006 and currently is a Colonel and the State Staff Judge Advocate. He received the Legion of Merit and the Army Meritorious Service Medal with two oak leaf clusters in recognition of his long-term service, including his work in mobilizing members of the Guard for service in Operation Desert Storm.justice.gov  Assistant Utah Attorney General  In 1982, Warner was appointed as an Assistant Attorney General of Utah. He served nearly six and one-half years in that office. He was a member of the litigation division for four years, three of which he served as division chief. He then served for two and one-half years as Associate Chief Deputy Attorney General. While employed in the Attorney General's office, he was primarily involved with state law and public policy issues. Warner worked on numerous high-profile cases, including the Hi-Fi murders. This was a criminal case in which three United States Air Force airmen committed murder, rape, and robbery in the Hi-Fi shop in Ogden, Utah. William Andrews and Dale Selby Pierre took five people hostage at the store and killed three of them. Pierre raped one of the female hostages before killing her. The two who survived had significant injuries. Keith Roberts assisted Pierre and Andrews with the robbery, but not with the other crimes. After the trial, Andrews and Pierre were found guilty and sentenced to death. Warner also worked on the Arthur Gary Bishop murder cases. Bishop had a history of molesting children for many years before he was caught. His crimes advanced to murder, and he confessed to murdering five young boys from 1979 to 1983. He was tried and found guilty of five counts of aggravated murder, five counts of aggravated kidnapping, and one count of sexually abusing a minor, and was sentenced to death. Bishop was executed by lethal injection at Utah State Prison in Point of the Mountain on June 10, 1988.  U.S. Attorney  Warner joined the United States Attorney's Office for the District of Utah in 1989. He held the positions of First Assistant United States Attorney, Chief of the Criminal Division, and Violent Crimes and Hate Crimes Coordinator. On July 29, 1998 he was nominated by President Bill Clinton and supported by Senator Orrin Hatch to be the United States Attorney for the District of Utah.Congressional Record Paul Warner was confirmed by the United States Senate and was sworn in on July 31, 1998. He was one of the only two U.S. Attorneys nationwide to be retained by President George W. Bush after Bush's election. Warner's taking office created a vacancy in the Criminal Chief's position, and he appointed veteran prosecutor Richard Lambert to the post. He also named Carlie Christensen as the new Civil Chief. She was the first female division chief in the office's history. He was Chairman of the United States Attorney General's Advisory Committee of U.S. Attorneys from 2001-2003. Warner was the U.S. Attorney during the September 11 attacks in 2001, and played an important role in advising the government on counter terrorism issues following the terrorist attack. Warner's office had a major role in the security planning of the events during the Salt Lake City 2002 Olympic Winter Games. Because the Olympics were held four months after 9/11, there was a tremendous public safety effort on the federal, state and local level.The Free Library Regarding illegal immigration, Warner had proposed an emphasis on prosecuting aggravated re-entry cases when he was criminal chief. The office's effort expanded over time into cases involving more conduct such as alien smuggling, alien harboring, transporting, and passport fraud. In addition to \\"Operation Safe Travel\\" and the commercial driver's license initiative, the Office mounted a consistent on-going immigration enforcement effort.  Utah State Bar and service to the legal profession  Paul Warner served on the Utah Supreme Court Advisory Committee on the rules of Civil Procedure, and he is on the Utah State Bar Mentoring Committee. Paul Warner has been involved in numerous professional organizations, including serving as a Master of the Bench in the American Inns of Court and Chairman of the Board of Visitors for the BYU Law School. He has received multiple military and civilian professional awards, including his election as a Fellow in the American College of Trial Lawyers. Judicial career In December, 2005, Warner accepted an appointment as the fourth United States magistrate judge in the District of Utah. He was sworn in on February, 2006. As a Magistrate Judge, Warner hears discovery disputes and other non-dispositive civil motions and lesser criminal offenses. Under a pilot program adopted by the federal judges in Utah, Warner has presided over civil trials with the consent of all parties. Notable cases/rulings= U.S. Attorney/Prosecutor cases  In 2002 the U.S. Attorney's Office filed the nation's first-ever Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) prosecution of a street gang on drug-related charges. The case was \\" _United States of America v. Tyrese Sharod Smith_ \\", 413 F.3d 1253 (10th Cir. 2005). The RICO conspiracy statute proved to be a particularly potent tool against two virulent criminal gangs. Ten members or significant associates of the King Mafia Disciples, a street and prison gang patterned after the Gangster Disciple Nation of Chicago, were indicted in 2002, charged with violations of the RICO conspiracy statute and with violent crime in aid of racketeering activity. KMD members engaged in drive-by shootings, walk-up shootings, home invasion robberies, drug trafficking crimes, and ordering murders from behind prison walls. One of the predicate acts, a murder ordered by the leader of KMD, was committed by members who killed a 19-year-old-boy with a sawed-off shotgun. This boy was mistakenly identified as a member of a rival gang. The leader of KMD was convicted after an eight-day trial and sentenced to life imprisonment. The nine other defendants pleaded and were sentenced to long terms. Litigation involving the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument was a significant civil case that was during Warner's time. The case was \\" _Utah Association of Counties v. George W. Bush_ \\", 455 F.3d 1094 (10th Cir. 2006). President Clinton's controversial creation of the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument turned into litigation as several states-rights advocacy groups sued to have the designation reversed. Division Chief Carlie Christensen headed a team with DOJ attorneys who, in multi-year litigation, gained a favorable judgment in the District Court and an affirmance by the Tenth Circuit.The Free Library Warner also prosecuted a case involving a bombing at Dixie State College in St. George, \\" _U.S. v. Robert Allen Little Jr._ \\", 132 F.3d 43 (10th Cir. 1997),Justia. U.S. Court of Appeals Cases and Opinions. and a case involving cross burning in Salt Lake City His specialty as a prosecutor was civil rights cases.  Magistrate Judge cases  Judge Warner presided over various proceedings in the case \\"United States of America v. Jeffrey Mowen\\", 2:09-CR-00098 (Utah 2010), which involved a man who used Morse code to allegedly order murders. Jeffrey Lane Mowen appeared before Warner, seeking a release from custody pending his trial on charges of wire fraud, witness tampering and retaliating against a witness, and solicitation to commit a crime of violence. Mowen had been arrested after scamming investors out of more than $18 million in a Ponzi scheme. Federal prosecutors stated that Mowen attempted to have four former investors murdered by a white supremacist so they couldn't testify against him while he was in the Davis County Jail. Prosecutors also stated that Mowen used Morse code in one instance to dictate a letter to another inmate ordering the murders. Judge Paul Warner denied Mowen's request for pretrial release. Deseret News Judge Warner also presided over many drug and child pornography prosecutions. In one case, a TV producer was arrested in 2007 at the Salt Lake City International Airport after child pornography was found in his luggage. Kevin Stewart McMahan was charged in federal court with one count each of possession and transportation of child pornography. Judge Warner agreed to release McMahan from custody pending trial under strict guidelines, such as wearing an ankle monitoring bracelet, because McMahan's job required extensive traveling, and he was not deemed to be a flight risk.Deseret News Another case involved Idaho State University history professor Thomas Francis Hale who was accused of a hantavirushoax in 2006. Federal prosecutors said the professor sent a fax suggesting that federal bankruptcy trustee Elizabeth Loveridge should check out the \\"Hazmat\\" that would be coming in an orange envelope. A few days later, an envelope arrived with \\"caution\\" written on it. There was a note inside that said \\"Termites or hantavirus from mice?\\" Assistant U.S. Attorney Trina Higgins said the note was wrapped around what was believed to be termites, and it didn't contain the hantavirus. The note was part of a federal indictment that was handed down against Hale, charging him with making the phony hantavirus hoax, lying to federal authorities and hiding assets during bankruptcy proceedings. Hale was arrested by the FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Force at the Salt Lake City International Airport after stepping off a flight from Chicago. Hale appeared before Judge Paul Warner, and he pleaded not guilty to the charges. Judge Warner ordered Hale to be released from the Salt Lake County Jail with a number of conditions of release, including that he have no contact with Loveridge except through her attorney and that he undergo mental health therapy.Deseret News In another case, a Southwest Airlines co-pilot faced federal DUI charges in 2006. A federal complaint was filed against Carl Fulton, who was accused of operating a plane under the influence of alcohol. Fulton was pulled from the cockpit of a Southwest Airlines Flight preparing to leave Salt Lake City bound for Phoenix after a Transportation Security Administration screener detected alcohol on his breath. The screener followed Fulton and watched him board the flight. Airport police were called and Fulton was asked to step outside the plane, according to a complaint filed in federal court. Fulton made an appearance before Judge Paul Warner, and he was charged with one count of operation of a common carrier under the influence of alcohol or other drugs. The charge carries a maximum penalty of 15 years in prison and up to $250,000 in fines./ Personal life Warner is married and has four children; two boys and two girls.

Through her mother‚Äôs previous marriages, she had various maternal half- brothers and sisters and two full blooded brothers who served as Seleucid kings Antiochus V Eupator and Alexander Balas. In 152 BC, Laodice became one of the supporters for her brother Alexander Balas, who revolted and overthrew the Seleucid king Demetrius I Soter, who was their maternal half- brother/cousin. The other alternative is Laodice appears to have come from obscure origins, connected with the same impostorship as Alexander Balas. Laodice could have been a supposed daughter of the Seleucid King Antiochus IV Epiphanes.Grainger, A Seleukid prosopography and gazetteer p.50 This is based on the assumption that the sister of Alexander Balas who appeared in Rome with him in 153 BC as a genuine daughter of Antiochus IV Epiphanes was the Laodice who married Mithridates V.Grainger, A Seleukid prosopography and gazetteer p.50 Antiochus IV Epiphanes had two daughters who were Laodice VI from this marriage to his sister-wife Laodice IV https://www.livius.org/la- ld/laodice/laodice_iv.html and his other daughter was Antiochis the child from his concubine.2 Maccabees 4:30 However this assumption shows that Antiochus IV Epiphanes may have had another daughter called Laodice, however this is not certain.Grainger, A Seleukid prosopography and gazetteer p.50 The assumption shows that there could some confusion about the identity of this Laodice VI. After 152 BC, Laodice married King Mithridates V of Pontus,Walbank, Cambridge ancient history: The hellenistic world, Volume 7 p.491 who reigned from 150‚Äì120 BC. Mithridates V and Laodice VI were related, as her husband had lineage from the Seleucid dynasty. Little is known regarding her relationship with her husband or her reign as Pontian queen. During their marriage, Laodice bore Mithridates V seven children: Laodice of Cappadocia, Mithridates VI of Pontus, Mithridates Chrestus, Laodice, Nysa (sometimes spelt as Nyssa), Roxana and Statira. Nysa, Roxana and Statira were put to death after the fall of the Kingdom of Pontus in 63 BC. Mithridates V was assassinated in about 120 BC in Sinope poisoned by unknown persons at a lavish banquet which he held.Mayor, The Poison King: the life and legend of Mithradates, Rome‚Äôs deadliest enemy p.68 In the will of Mithridates V, he left the kingdom to the joint rule of Laodice, Mithridates VI and Mithridates Chrestus. Both of her sons were underage to rule and Laodice retained all power as regent.Mayor, The Poison King: the life and legend of Mithradates, Rome‚Äôs deadliest enemy p.69 Laodice in her regency favored her second son over her first son. During her regency 120‚Äì116 BC (even perhaps up to 113 BC), Mithridates VI escaped from the plotting of his mother and had gone into hiding.

Biography = Early years  Manuel Antonio Cordero y Bustamante was born in 1753 in the Andalusian province of Cadiz, Spain. At age 19 he joined the Spanish army, beginning his career as a cadet on December 1, 1767. He only spent four years in this army and by 1771 he was living in Mexico, where he joined the army. Over seven years he served in various Spanish armies, such as the Corps of Zamora, the Dragoons of Spain and New Spain, and companies of the presidio of Janos and San Buenaventura. Eventually, he attained the rank of lieutenant colonel.Pares, Ross (1976). The Governors of Texas. Pages 44 and 45. Between 1777 and 1790, he fought in many wars in the Provincias Internas (Interior Provinces), a province consisting of Alta and Baja California, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Nueva Vizcaya and Coahuila, and other regions of northern Mexico. There he had his first contact with Texas and Coahuila, two places where later he would occupy the governor's office. He participated in a total of twenty-five military campaigns in the region. However, in four of them, he operated only as a subordinate, but in the others he served as commander. In 1787, Cordero y Bustamante signed a peace treaty with several Native American people of the zone: the Mimbre√±os (an Apaches tribe) and the Gilena. Between 1790 and 1791, while he occupied the post of commander of the Nueva Vizcaya, he began to persecute the marauders and punish Native Americans who had rebelled against the Spanish and were threatening the ranches of the settlers. In 1794, Bustamante returned to fight againts the Mimbres and Gilena peoples, who had attacked the Presidio of Janos. In 1795, he led the first expedition to the Presidio del Norte (North Presidio), where he faced the Mescaleros. Between 1795 and 1800, Bustamante founded many settlements and towns in Coahuila. On December 27, 1796, he began leading the troops from the border of Coahuila. In January 1797, the King of Spain appointed him governor of Texas to replace Manuel Mu√±oz in his later years. However, during this time he fought the Apaches, and so was unable to fill the position. Later, on March 27 of that year, the king of Spain named him acting governor of Coahuila. Cordero sent a letter to Manuel Mu√±oz indicating he had been appointed acting governor of that city. However, in 1805, while Cordero governed Coahuila, he was also appointed acting governor of Texas and he had to leave the government of Coahuila.  Government in Coahuila and Texas  In September 1805, during his administration in Texas, he came to San Antonio because he had received orders to strengthen several military posts in Orcoquisas, Nacogdoches, and Los Adaes. Cordero y Bustamante led troops in Nacogdoches to protect the eastern frontier of Texas (which was a target of the American government, which wanted to occupy the region). However, in the fall of 1806, Bustamante left the region because the zone located between the Sabine and Arroyo Hondo ceased to be disputed, as it was declared neutral zone. In addition, he promoted the emigration to Texas, mainly of craftsmen, to build a fort against American invasion. He convinced people of the interior provinces of modern Mexico to emigrate to San Antonio, but he also tried to get North American immigrants to leave San Antonio and he established a law that freed those slaves who emigrated from Louisiana to Texas. Moreover, he promoted friendly between the soldiers and settlers with the Native Americans for defending the frontier. In 1806, Cordero y Bustamante ordered the construction of the first hospital in Texas, which was intended chiefly for soldiers. Cordero y Bustamante governed Texas until November 7, 1808. In this year, he finished his term, being replaced by Manuel Mar√≠a de Salcedo (appointed governor of Texas on April 24). In 1809, Cordero y Bustamante was appointed governor of Coahuila. However, under a royal order, he had to continue living temporarily in Texas to help Salcedo in his new duties as governor and help in the defense of the borders of the province. He remained there until 1810. Also, during this time, he planned to create settlement areas in Colorado, San Marcos de Reve, Brazos, Trinity, and the Guadalupe River. However, he only managed to establish settlements in San Marcos and Trinidad, in addition to another settlement: Palafox Villa. He moved to Coahuila in 1810, beginning his term as governor of that province. In 1813, Cordero was governor of the province of Sonora and Sinaloa; Almada, Francisco R. (2010).

In 1817, he stepped down as governor of Coahuila and in 1819 he again became governor of Sonora and Sinaloa.  Last years  Later, in 1822, Cordero was appointed commanding general of the Western Interior Provinces.

He refused to endorse the Plan of Casa Mata, which did away with the first imperium, and resigned from office on March 6, 1823. He died a few days later. He was buried on March 25, 1823. Cordero y Bustamante wrote a very important monograph about the Comanches.Letras Mexicanas XVII: Apaches (in Spanish: Mexican letters XVII: Apaches). Consulted in May 3, 2015.  Personal life  The America explorer Zebulon Pike made an interesting physical and personal description of Cordero. According to him, the Spanish political and soldier was blond, his eyes were blue, his complexion was clear, and he was about five feet and ten inches tall. As for his behavior, he believed that the military man had great confidence in himself and he was one of the most capable commanders on the Spanish Texas border.

Their capture led to the unveiling of a vast family fortune spread around the world amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars. A report by the U.S. General Accounting Office indicated that over $90 million were transferred out of Mexico and into private bank accounts in Switzerland and London, through a complex set of transactions between 1992 and 1994, using a private investment company named Trocca, all with the help of Citibank and its affiliates. In 2008, the government of Switzerland turned over $74 million, out of the $110 million in frozen bank accounts held by Trocca to the government of Mexico. The Swiss Justice Ministry indicated that the Mexican government had demonstrated that $66 million of the funds had been misappropriated, and the funds, with interest, were returned to Mexico. The bank accounts were held at Pictet & Cie, Citibank Zurich, Julius Baer Bank, and Banque priv√©e Edmond de Rothschild in Geneva and Zurich.

There are many local walks where evidence of human activity going back to the Stone Age can be found. Salen has for centuries been one of Loch Sunart's safest anchorages. The stone pier was built when Salen was one of the main ports in the 19th century visited by steamers and other vessels. In 2011 the facilities at the pier were enhanced with a nine berth pontoon. The Salen Hotel was built by C.D. Rudd, the diamond millionaire, who along with Cecil Rhodes each bought a quarter share of De Beers gold mine and diamond fields. During the Second World War, due to the remoteness and ease with which the peninsula could be cut off, the entire area was used for Special Forces military training.

Biography The Battle of Smolensk by Langlois (1812) Langlois was born in Beaumont-en-Auge. He graduated from the √âcole Polytechnique in 1806 and fought, as an infantry officer at the battles of Wagram, Gerona and Waterloo with a bravery that had him seriously injured and appointed colonel at the young age of twenty-six. After he retired on half- pay, Langlois devoted himself to painting. Studying with Girodet-Trioson, he specialized in landscapes, painting battles only, for he considered these to embody the most intense experiences life could offer. His paintings include the Fire of Moscow, the Battle of Eylau, the Battle of the Nile, the Battle of Montereau, the Battle of Borodino, the Battle of Wagram. He also used photography to document the Crimean War where he traveled with photographer L√©on-Eug√®ne M√©h√©din. He specialized in panoramic painting after having seen the Panorama of Athens by the first French panorama painter Pierre Pr√©vost. Many of his panoramas were destroyed during the Siege of Paris (1870‚Äì1871). In 1873, Langlois' family bequeathed 256 paintings representing battles and military panoramas to the mus√©e des Beaux-Arts de Caen.R√©my Desquesnes, Caen 1900-2000 : un si√®cle de vie, F√©camp, √âditions des Falaises, 2001.

In 1948, Niiler, his six siblings and parents arrived in Pittsburgh from a displaced persons camp in Germany where they had lived after fleeing Estonia during World War II. His father, Herbert Niiler, coached the Estonia national basketball team at the 1936 Olympic Games and later ran a YMCA camp near Zelienople, Pa. Peter Niiler studied engineering at Lehigh University and graduated in 1960. In 1964 he received doctorate from Brown University where he studied applied mathematics and fluid mechanics. He was a Fulbright fellow at Cambridge University and postdoctoral fellow at Harvard. In 1966, he joined Nova University where he studied the Florida Current and the Gulf Stream. He became professor of oceanography at Oregon State University in 1974. He became professor at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in 1982 where he worked in the Physical Oceanography Research Division. He was a Scripps Distinguished Professor. Status of the global drifter array 3 days after Niller's death on October 18, 2010 Niiler designed ocean drifters for measuring direct circulation flow and other instruments for ocean observations. He was the scientific father of the Global Drifter Program and one of the persons responsible for organizing a Boulder, Colorado, meeting in 1982 which initiated the program itself. One of his more clever designs was an ocean drifting measurement device he called the holey sock. Beginning in 2002, Niiler became involved in tropical hurricane research and his group deployed the first groups of thermistor chain drifters before approaching hurricanes. His final field project was related to tropical hurricanes influence on ocean mixing in the Western Pacific. The project was ongoing when he died, and he coordinated deployment of the thermistor chain drifters of his design during that project. His thermistor chain drifters sampled Typhoon Fanapi in September 2010. Niiler was particularly interested in typhoon cold wake to study relaxation of the mixed layer temperature after cyclone passage. His interests included measurements of flow and theory of variability of eastern boundary current systems, relationship of heat flux to global sea surface temperature variability, Lagrangian circulation measurements in mixed layers of the world ocean, and response of upper ocean to tropical storms. He was named fellow of the American Geophysical Union in 1986. He was a Distinguished Visiting Scientist at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in 1979. He was married to Ann Easton in 1960 and had two sons, Eric and Benjamin. They divorced in 1974. His second marriage was to Nancy McCaleb. Their daughter is Ashley. According to Scripps News \\"He had a passion for architecture and designed numerous homes and several buildings. He played a leading role in creating the distinctive design of the W.M. Keck Foundation Center for Ocean Atmosphere Research, in which his office was housed. He was a painter, a gourmet chef, and an aficionado of wine and travel.\\" He was also supporter of the dance company founded by his wife, Nancy McCaleb.

The conflict was initiated when the Moroccan ruler Mohammed ash-Sheikh refused to give allegiance to the Ottomans. Hasan Pasha, the son of Barbarossa, was named by the Ottoman Empire beylerbey of the Regency of Algiers in June 1557, in order to continue the fight against the Moroccan ruler. He had Mohammed ash-Sheikh assassinated in October 1557 by one of his bodyguards.

In the 1970s, it found itself in direct competition with K-tel and other compilation labels. In the 1980s, the original company was sold to Dutch entrepreneur Herman Heinsbroek, who expanded it into a worldwide multi-media company. History Arcade Records was founded in 1972 by Laurence Myers, a British music industry professional who had been working in music management and production for various top British artists such as The Animals, David Bowie and The Rolling Stones. In the early 1970s, he realised that many music consumers were hometaping their favourite songs in order to create a mixtape of current top hits or the best songs by one artist.Billboard Magazine, 24 April 1982 Myers copied this trend by releasing multi-artist and one-artist compilation albums. The idea of issuing several hit songs on one album was not new to the UK market, which had been flooded by cheap compilations like Top of the Pops on budget labels like Hallmark or MFP, most of which contained cover versions by anonymous artists, rather than the original hit versions. Although these albums were very successful - three of them had reached number one in 1971 alone - Arcade decided to pick only original songs and artists for their releases. Arcade relied heavily on promotion through TV and radio ads, an idea conceived by Myers' business partners (and his brothers-in-law) Michael and Larry Levene, who had made their fortunes selling kitchen appliances through TV commercials. Arcade's first release was 20 Fantastic Hits, released in the summer of 1972. It rapidly rose to the top of the UK LP chart, where it replaced K-tel's 20 Dynamic Hits, which had been K-tel's first number one album. Despite this promising start, Arcade eventually only managed to release a handful of multi-artist compilation hits (fewer than K-tel had), while it had some success with its range of one-artist compilations. In the UK, it had four number one albums: * 20 Fantastic Hits - Various Artists (1972) * 40 Golden Greats - Jim Reeves (1975) * The Best of Roy Orbison - Roy Orbison (1976) * 40 Greatest Hits - Elvis Presley (1977) By the early 1980s, Arcade's UK division was close to dormant, while its international activities - most notably in the Benelux, operated by Arcade Records Benelux in the Netherlands - remained active and successful. In 1983, the head of the Benelux operations, Herman Heinsbroek, bought Arcade's international parent company and began to rebuild the brand. Other divisions soon started in Germany, France, Spain, Italy, Denmark, Sweden and Norway. Heinsbroek also bought Arcade International, which handled publishing and copyrights obtained by Arcade. The \\"new\\" Arcade was instantly successful, thanks to the upcoming CD market from the mid-1980s onwards. Many consumers who had owned their favourite music on vinyl for years began to replace it on the new digital format. Arcade stepped into this new market by releasing many compilation albums, which catered for those consumers who would prefer to buy a Best Of-CD from their favourite artist, rather than their entire back catalogue. By the early 1990s, Arcade even returned to the UK market, where it found a lot of success with its compilations of house music (e.g. the Ghetto Groove series). By now the company had become a multi-media operation, with interests in publishing, broadcasting (both radio and TV), retail and video. It had also acquired several local and international record labels, such as Dutch CNR Music. In 1998 the parent company in the Netherlands, until then still owned by Herman Heinsbroek, was sold to Dutch publishing house Wegener. However, the compilation market had become saturated by the late 1990s, while the biggest- selling compilations were either issued by large conglomerates (e.g.,the Now That's What I Call Music! series, which was released by majors such as EMI or Virgin) or by an artist's own record label. Arcade's fortunes began to dwindle, which resulted in Wegener eventually selling Arcade's music interests. Eventually, Arcade formed a joint venture with Roadrunner Records in 2000 as Roadrunner Arcade Music, thereby becoming one of the world's largest indie record companies. It released everything from Nu-Metal to Nu- NRG. Later, all divisions (except CNR Music and Arcade's Belgium division) were sold to Roadrunner Records. The Arcade moniker completely disappeared and CNR Music was revived as a fully independent company. After several attempts to revive the label (only domestically in the Netherlands and with only modest success), Arcade currently serves as a digital platform which compiles playlists for Spotify based on Arcade's catalogues.Current Arcade website (in Dutch) Meanwhile, Herman Heinsbroek was an Economic Affairs Minister in a short-lived Dutch coalition government in 2001, led by Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende.

Plot Four years ago, border patrol agent Jim Rhodes (Steve Austin) was stationed in Texas. Jim and his partner, his longtime friend Lee Davis (Eric Roberts), are staking out what looks like an empty trailer. As a gift, Lee gives Jim a watch that has a band made from climbing rope. The band can be unraveled and used in case of emergency. After Jim calls for backup, Jim and Lee decide to go in. What they find is a meth lab that looks abandoned. But two men come up from a door that was built into the trailer's floor, and they open fire, shooting Lee. Jim kills the two men, and another man opens fire from under the trailer. Jim makes the man come up through the same door the other two came through, and the man sets the trailer on fire. Lee kills the man, and Lee tells Jim to run, just before Lee dies. Reluctantly, Jim leaves Lee behind, running out of the trailer as it explodes because of the highly volatile chemicals used for producing meth. Now, Jim and his rebellious teenage daughter Kim (Marie Avgeropoulos) are living in the mountains in Lowery, Montana. In Reno, Nevada, a man named Lawson (Michael Hogan) and his crew of thieves have just robbed the Hotel Palacio casino. Lawson takes the millions of dollars in bearer bonds they stole, and leaves a bomb behind in a warehouse to kill the rest of the thieves, who include his psychopathic right-hand man Banks (Gil Bellows). Banks defuses the bomb, and with the help of a tracking device, Banks thinks he knows exactly where Lawson is going. Banks and the other thieves‚ÄîJensen (Gary Daniels), Geary (Michael Eklund), Crab (Adrian Holmes), and Dominika (Emilie Ullerup)--vow to find Lawson and get the bonds back. In Montana the next day, Kim says she's going to her friend Megan's house to help Megan pack for a trip. Later, Jim gets a call from Sheriff Westlake (Donnelly Rhodes), who says he has Kim in his office for shoplifting. Jim goes to Westlake's office, and finds Banks and his crew there, beating Westlake up. Banks believes that Lawson is in Montana, and is planning to cross into Canada by foot. Banks wants to find Lawson and get the bonds, and Banks says that Westlake is not being very accommodating. Banks kills Westlake. Banks wants Jim to guide them through the mountains, to find Lawson. In order to make Jim do it, Banks takes Kim hostage. Banks tells Jim that if Jim screws up in any way, Kim dies. In the mountains, it's a grueling trek. At one point, Crab tries to rape Kim, and Jim beats Crab up, breaking several of his bones. After that, Jensen fatally shoots Crab. After they find Lawson and the money, and Dominika fatally shoots Lawson, Banks sends Jim plunging off a cliff, and leaves him to die. Jim survives, and while Banks is forcing Kim to guide him and his crew, Jim carves some sharp points into some branches to make spears out of them, and finds a bag with a crossbow in it. Jim starts hunting Banks and his crew, who have left a wounded Geary behind after Banks beat Geary up for arguing with him. Jim shoots Geary three times with the compound bow. Geary tells Jim that Banks has taken over Lawson's plan to go into Canada. As Geary begs Jim not to shoot again, Jim shoots an arrow into Geary's chest, killing Geary. Next, Jim tracks the others down and confronts Jensen, who is a martial arts expert. Jim ends the grueling fight by fatally stabbing Jensen with a broken tree branch. Banks wonders where Jensen is at, and Banks is feeling uneasy. Dominika, who is using a rope to hold on to Kim so she does not get away, tells Banks that they have to keep moving. Jim tracks them down, and throws one of the wooden spears he carved. Banks jumps out of the way, and the spear hits Dominika, killing her. That infuriates Banks. Kim tries to escape, but Banks doesn't let her. Taking Kim with him, Banks finds an outpost where there are three Canadian cops, and three ATVs. Banks kills the three cops, punches Kim and knocks her down, and then takes off on one of the ATVs. Jim finds Kim, and he tells her to take one of the remaining two ATVs and go for help while Jim goes after Banks with the other one. Jim chases Banks down, and they fight. Jim chases Banks down a hill and into what looks like an abandoned factory. Banks even fires a flare gun at Jim. They try to hit each other with shovels. Banks hits Jim a couple of times, and then Jim beats Banks up and hits Banks in the face with a shovel, knocking Banks down. Jim thinks it's over, but Banks gets back up and tries to shove Jim through the nearby catwalk's guard rail. Jim turns the tables, and shoves Banks down onto the pile of wooden skids below. Jim, taking the bonds with him so he can return them, goes outside and sees Kim, who says she couldn't leave him. Banks stumbles outside, and he says \\"Did you think you could take my money?\\" Jim tells Kim to get back, and Jim gets on one of the ATVs. Banks says \\"You can't kill me!\\" Jim says \\"When I hunt, I hunt to kill.\\" And then Jim floors it, and rams the ATV right into Banks, pinning Banks up against a wall just inside the building, and gas is leaking from the ATV. Jim starts walking away. Again, Banks says \\"You can't kill me!\\" Kim urges Jim to kill Banks for what he's done. Jim fires the flare gun at the ATV, causing an explosion that kills Banks. Jim and Kim are glad they've survived, but they know they have a long walk home.

It was founded in 1937 as CNR Records by Cornelis Nicolaas Rood, who made his fortune as a producer of lampshades and other lighting materials. Rood regarded his record label merely as a hobby, but things changed for the better in the early 1950s when CNR bought distribution and marketing rights for several foreign pop and classical record companies. He also signed up several local artists. One of CNR's first major successes was Dutch singer Gert Timmerman, who became one of the Dutch top selling male artists from the end of the 1950s. In the 1960s, CNR enjoyed major successes with artists like Trio Hellenique, Gert Timmerman (who was also part of a duo, Gert & Hermien) and Heintje, a Dutch teenage singer who sold millions of singles and albums in Europe between 1966 and the early 1970s. By this time, CNR had grown into one of the Dutch major independent record labels. It mainly focussed on local talent such as Andr√© van Duin, Benny Neyman and Tol Hansse, but it also had hit singles with licensed international productions like Baccara's Yes Sir, I Can Boogie and Sorry, I'm a Lady. Local success continued well into the 1980s with artists including Stars on 45. CNR began distributing the up-and-coming Jive Records label in 1982. In the budding video market, CNR had a major presence with its CNR Video label, which specialised in kids material (Bassie & Adriaan). In 1988 Rene Froger released his first top 10 hit (\\"Winter in America\\"), a Doug Ashdown cover on the CNR label. The singer would record two successful albums: Who Dares Wins (1988) and You're My Everything (1989). Both were certified with a golden award and his first number one hit in Dutch. The singer then signed to Dino Music and became the best selling Dutch musician of the early nineties. In the early 1990s, CNR had become a subsidiary of Arcade Records, which was then a major compilation label in the Netherlands. However, Arcade was on the brink of bankruptcy and warned that all its signed artists could lose their recording contracts if the bankruptcy went ahead. Arcade survived, but CNR's output and success diminished drastically later in the decade. It also underwent several management, licensing and name changes, including a joint venture with American rock label Roadrunner Records in 1998. CNR is billed as CNR Entertainment, with the emphasis on local product, kids material, comedy and TV series. It has resurrected the Arcade compilation label and distributes several smaller labels. Until the end of 2012 it holds the distribution and marketing rights for Roadrunner acts such as Lenny Kravitz, Young the Giant, and Nickelback. In August 2011, CNR announced a joint venture with the Dutch branch of Rough Trade to oversee the distribution of their material. The joint venture was launched as Tone Entertainment.

He was senior rabbi at Congregation Emanu-El in San Francisco for 19 years. Family Joseph Asher was born Joseph Ansbacher on January 7, 1921, in Heilbronn-am-Neckar, Germany. He changed his surname as early as 1947. He was the sixth generation of rabbis in his family. His father, Jonah Ansbacher (1880‚Äì1967) was an Orthodox rabbi who had received a doctorate from the University of Erlangen, writing a thesis on a 13th-century Arab cosmologist. His father was ordained by Rabbi Solomon Breuer and he was an ardent follower of Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch, founder of the Torah im Derech Eretz trend in Judaism. Joseph Asher left the Orthodox Judaism of his ancestors and later became a Reform rabbi. Education After his father received a rabbinic appointment, the Ansbacher family moved to Wiesbaden in 1925, where Joseph attended the Staatliche Gymnasium. When the Nazis took power in Germany in January 1933, he was one of only seven Jews in a student body of around 600, and the only Jew in his class. He endured three years of harassment including an antisemitic insult carved into the top of his desk, and other students singing popular songs calling for the murder of the Jews. In 1936, all Jewish students were expelled from the public schools, and his parents sent him to the Talmud Torah school in Hamburg, led by Rabbi Joseph Carlebach, where he graduated in spring, 1938. Among the frequent guest lecturers in his senior year was Martin Buber. Because of the severely deteriorating conditions for Jews in Germany, his family had obtained exit visas in 1933 to be used at the appropriate time. His family sent Joseph to London after his graduation in 1938 to begin rabbinical college. He attended Etz Chaim Yeshiva in London and Jews' College (now the London School of Jewish Studies). After the war, he finished his studies at Hebrew Union College in Cincinnati, Ohio. His semikhah described him as shalselet rabbanim, that is, a member of a chain of rabbis in a long family tradition. World War II On Kristallnacht, November 9, 1938, the Nazis began open war against the Jews, and his father's synagogue in Wiesbaden was vandalized and shut down. While heading to the railroad station in an attempt to escape, his father was arrested by the Gestapo, confined to Buchenwald for ten weeks, and then released when he agreed to use his visa and leave Germany forever. His parents arrived as refugees in London in February 1939. After the British defeat at Dunkirk on June 4, 1940, a wave of xenophobia against German refugees swept across Great Britain, and all of them were arrested, including the Jews and other anti-Nazis. His father was interned on the Isle of Man. Joseph was confined in an internment camp at Huyton, and shortly thereafter loaded onto the troop ship HMT Dunera, along with over 2,000 other anti-Nazi refugees. The ship sailed for Australia on July 10, 1940. He described conditions on the 57-day voyage as \\"cruel and sadistic\\" as British guards frequently beat prisoners with rifle butts, and plundered their belongings. It was \\"the most horrendous experience of his life.\\" After the emaciated prisoners arrived in Sydney, they were confined to internment camps until the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and the Philippines in December 1941. The prisoners were then allowed to enlist in the Australian Army, where Joseph served as a chaplain. He met his wife Fae in Australia. Rabbinic career Upon his discharge from military service, he served at the Melbourne Liberal Synagogue as assistant to Rabbi Hermann Sanger, who helped resettle Jewish refugees in Australia. He then went on to serve the Hobart Hebrew Congregation, where he was introduced at a centenary celebration for the synagogue. Asher immigrated to the United States in 1947, and served at synagogues in Olean, New York; Sarasota, Florida; and then in Tuscaloosa, Alabama from 1956 to 1958. He served as rabbi of Temple Emmanuel in Greensboro, North Carolina from 1958 to 1968, and at Congregation Emanu-El in San Francisco from 1967 until his retirement in 1986 as rabbi emeritus. German-Jewish relations after the Holocaust Left to right: Rabbi Zvi Helfgott (later Rabbi Zvi Asaria), Joseph Rosensaft and Rabbi Joseph Asher, members of the Central Jewish Committee for the British Zone of Germany. Photo taken at Bergen-Belsen, probably in 1947. In London, Asher had established a friendship with Lily Montagu CBE of the World Union for Progressive Judaism. In 1947, she recommended him to Leo Baeck, the organization's president, as an emissary to visit various German cities to investigate the status of the Jews in the immediate postwar period. He spent six weeks assessing the needs of displaced persons, including a lengthy visit to Bergen-Belsen. Everywhere, he found nothing but devastation and despair. \\"The human eye cannot fathom such horrible sights as I had to see\\", he later wrote about that trip. A 1955 trip to Germany led him to begin to consider a \\"re-orientation of the Jewish relationship with Germany\\". In 1961, motivated by the worldwide attention paid to the Adolf Eichmann trial in Israel, he began openly speaking about the Holocaust and the future of the relationship between Germany and the Jews. Asher visited Germany again at the invitation of the German government in 1964, to learn what the German educational system taught students about the Jews. He visited his alma mater gymnasium, as well as the Max Planck Institute, and met with the Commissioners of Education of the Federal Republic of Germany. He described his experiences in an article he wrote for Look magazine, called \\"A Rabbi Asks: Isn't It Time We Forgave the Germans?\\" Although many people criticized Asher for this article, Berlin Mayor Willy Brandt responded favorably, as did the Union of American Hebrew Congregations. In 1965, Rabbi Asher led a contingent of four German-speaking rabbis, who met with over 8000 German teachers in training, and helped the German school system develop its first curriculum for secondary schools covering the Holocaust. He explained the thinking behind his work in Germany in an interview published in the Aufbau on March 11, 1966: \\"A new generation is growing up that was not born when the horrible crime was committed and for which they cannot be held responsible. The only positive thing we can do is to acquaint them with the Jews, their teachings, customs, and history, which they have not had the opportunity to know.\\" As the years passed, he repeatedly visited Judaic studies programs in German universities, and late in life became a visiting professor at the Kirchliche Hochschule in Berlin. He served on an international committee of scholars to help design a memorial at the Wannsee Villa, where the Nazi leadership planned the Final Solution in January 1942. In 1989, the German government awarded him the Grand Cross of Merit. In 1980, he was appointed to the United States Holocaust Memorial Council chartered by the U.S. Congress to plan the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. The museum opened in Washington, D.C., in 1993, three years after his death. Civil rights movement In 1958, he became rabbi of Temple Emanuel in Greensboro, North Carolina. On February 1, 1960, the Greensboro sit-ins began, an effort to desegregate the lunch counter at the local Woolworth's store. He was one of only two local white clergymen who collaborated with black community leaders and black clergymen in support of racial tolerance and desegregation, including the sit-ins. This sit-in movement spread throughout the southern states, leading in many communities to progress toward desegregation, and increasing political pressure on the federal government. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 made segregation of public accommodations illegal. As a rabbi in the deep South, he did not hesitate to speak out against racial discrimination in the workplace, even when the employers were Jewish.http://library.uncg.edu/dp/crg/personBio.aspx?c=18 Rabbi Asher was wary of militant extremism. In San Francisco, he refused to share a podium with radical minister Jim Jones, who went on to mass suicide at Jonestown. Israeli-Palestinian conflict Rabbi Asher supported reconciliation between Israelis and Palestinians. He participated in Breira, an organization that advocated Israeli territorial concessions in the period following the Yom Kippur War. He also served on the advisory boards of Friends of Peace Now and the New Israel Fund. His support for these organizations resulted in harsh criticism and accusations of anti-Zionism. Death and legacy Asher died of prostate cancer on May 29, 1990. A festschrift honoring Joseph Asher and his life's work was being edited by Moses Rischin and his son Rabbi Raphael Asher at the time of his death, and was published in 1991. The book is entitled The Jewish Legacy and the German Conscience, and includes essays by 23 scholars, including Gunther Plaut, David Ellenson, David G. Dalin, Immanuel Jakobovits, Jakob Josef Petuchowski, Paul R. Mendes-Flohr, and Gerhard Weinberg. Elie Wiesel wrote the afterword. His successor at Congregation Emanu-El in San Francisco, Robert Kirschner, wrote that Rabbi Asher \\"embodied those attributes of German Jewry of which his generation was the last living witness: dignity, sobriety, erudition, and a singular elegance. Historian Fred Rosenbaum wrote that: \\"His deep learning, his continental manner, and above all his personal integrity afforded many congregants a sense of stability in a tumultuous world.\\" His son, Rabbi Raphael W. Asher, served as the rabbi at Congregation B'nai Tikvah in Walnut Creek, California until his retirement in 2014. Congregation Emanu-El in San Francisco sponsors an annual Rabbi Asher Memorial Lecture, usually featuring a scholar who has continued Joseph Asher's life's work on Germany and the Jews.

The name Ill Bethisad itself is Brithenig for the universe, a calque from Welsh bydysawd or Latin baptizatum. In addition, many other languages from our world have been changed in some way, although some, like German, Italian, or Russian, appear to be exactly the same. In many cases, as with Spanish, English, or Japanese, the changes are relatively slight and mainly affect orthography or Romanizations. One example is the language of Galicia, which is called Ruthenian (rather than Ukrainian) and is written with Polish orthography (rather than Cyrillic; see Ukrainian Latin Alphabet for real-world examples). Others are more drastic; Ill Bethisad Croatian, for example, is an invented Slavic language that in many respects is closer to Czech than our world's Croatian, and the Dalmatian of Ill Bethisad seems to be influenced by Slavic languages more than its real world counterpart was. Points of divergence The central point of divergence of Ill Bethisad is a stronger Roman Empire. Nevertheless, history runs mostly parallel to the history of the real world, so that many countries and regions have their own separate points of divergence: * Latin developed into a Romance language in the British Isles (Wales and western England) and Central Europe (Poland and Slovakia) as it did in France and continental Europe. * The Partitions of Veneda (historical alternative to Poland) were stopped by Napoleon, and the Venedo-Lithuanian Commonwealth exists to date as the Republic of the Two Crowns. Its present territory is roughly the same as the combined territories of Poland, Lithuania, and East Prussia during the period between the First and Second World War. It also has a colony in Africa, Gambia (part of which, in real-world history, belonged to a prince who was a vassal of seventeenth-century Poland). Another difference is that while the Veneds are Catholics like the Poles, most Lithuanians still confess to paganism, which today has developed into a form similar to that of the Romuva religion of our world. * A Czech-like Germanic language developed in Bohemia and Silesia under pressure from the Habsburg nobility, who wanted a unified language for the territory. * The Bolsheviks in Russia were defeated by the White Army, producing a nationalistic government. * The Kingdom of Castille and the Aragonese Crown never joined in Spain. * Napoleon did not attack Russia, nor was he defeated at Waterloo.Jakub Kowalski, Wymy≈õlone jƒôzyki , on: Relaz.pl, 2 March 2007. * The American Revolution did not happen and therefore the United States as we know it does not exist. Instead, there is a North American League, each state of which is still subject to a European crown. In general, there are more independent countries than there are in the real world, and constitutional monarchies, federations, colonies, and condominia are far more numerous. The history of Ill Bethisad, on the whole, often sees extinct or minority languages such as Catalan, Low Saxon, Crimean Gothic as well as others remaining more widely spoken in their respective regions than they have become in real-world history. Also, technologies that have either fallen out of favor or failed to develop in our world are explored and broadly utilized. For example, zeppelins and ekranoplans or ground-effect vehicles are still in use, both for military and civil purposes. Computers are not highly developed and there is no 'Silicon Valley' of North America, but information technology centres are instead found in Ireland.  Appearances in real world  A Russian website fighting state propaganda reported that the Oscar winning director and strong backer of Putin's politics Nikita Mikhalkov used a map image depicting alternate history's Russia from the Bethisad realm as a real evidence claiming western countries' desire to dismember Russia into smaller states. The map image was demonstrated live in a TV program hosted by Mikhalkov broadcast on one of the major Russian TV networks (Russia 24). The related portion of the video can be viewed on the Russia 24 YouTube channel.

The rollers freely rotate about three parallel axes, which are arranged with uniform horizontal spacing. Two outer rollers, usually immobile, cradle the bottom of the material while the inner roller, whose position is adjustable, presses on the topside of the material. Roll bending may be done to both sheet metal and bars of metal. If a bar is used, it is assumed to have a uniform cross-section, but not necessarily rectangular, as long as there are no overhanging contours, i.e. positive draft. Such bars are often formed by extrusion. The material to be shaped is suspended between the rollers. The end rollers support the bottomside of the bar and have a matching contour (inverse shape) to it in order to maintain the cross-sectional shape. Likewise, the middle roller is forced against the topside of the bar and has a matching contour to it.  Operation  After the bar is initially inserted into the jig, the middle roller is manually lowered and forced against the bar with a screw arrangement. This causes the bar to undergo both plastic and elastic deformation. The portion of the bar between the rollers will take on the shape of a cubic polynomial, which approximates a circular arc. The rollers are then rotated moving the bar along with them. For each new position, the portion of the bar between the rollers takes on the shape of a cubic modified by the end conditions imposed by the adjacent sections of the bar. When either end of the bar is reached, the force applied to the center roller is incrementally increased, the roller rotation is reversed and as the rolling process proceeds, the bar shape becomes a better approximation to a circular arc, gradually, for the number of passes required to bring the arc of the bar to the desired radius.221x221px  Plastic and elastic deformation  Close up of the roll bender jig The plastic deformation of the bar is retained throughout the process. However, the elastic deformation is reversed as a section of bar leaves the area between the rollers. This spring-back needs to be compensated in adjusting the middle roller to achieve a desired radius. The amount of spring back depends upon the elastic compliance (inverse of stiffness) of the material relative to its ductility. Aluminum alloys, for example, tend to have high ductility relative to their elastic compliance, whereas steel tends to be the other way around. Therefore aluminum bars are more amenable to bending into an arc than are steel bars.

Families whose incomes were dependent on the employment opportunities provided by the shows had traditionally found it difficult to access mainstream educational services leading in some cases to interruption or abandonment of education at an early age and in others either the splitting up of families as one parent or carer stayed on the circuit whilst another settled in one place on a permanent basis or cessation of the occupation by parents and carers. A sub-section of the Brisbane School of Distance Education (BSDE), the actual school consisted of two mobile classrooms which were transported separately each week to a new location (usually the grounds of a primary school). The site of the temporary locations was dictated by the routes followed by the show circuits. The school maintained an administrative office on the BDSE campus in the Brisbane suburb of Coorparoo.  Genesis  In Australia distance education is both well established and well regarded. Standard distance education programs had been regularly utilised by show people up to degree level but it was felt that it was necessary to provide an educational methodology that both followed a mainstream formal curriculum and allowed the students to maintain a distinctive cultural identity. After sustained lobbying by representatives of the Australian Romani community and the Showman's Guild of Australia, the Queensland government agreed to establish a specially developed distance learning curriculum for the children in 1989. Following the success of this program it was decided in 1999 to set up a mobile school with transportable classrooms which could accompany the show people on their circuits and provide a more structured learning environment. The school first opened its doors to pupils for an initial trial period in January 2000.  Operation  The school operated three \\"runs\\". Two of which, the \\"Northern\\" and the \\"Lower\\", conducted classes in specially adapted semi-trailers which were hauled from location to location by a prime mover driven by a staff member. Each Prep (i.e. \\"K\\") to Year 7 semi trailer travelling classroom was staffed by two teachers and supported by one operations officer. A third run operated as and when required at locations where there were sufficient students whose families were working off the main show circuits who could attend classes. This run typically conducted classes in rooms at a local host school. For example, in one week in October 2011, one trailer was located in the Mount Gambier Showgrounds in South Australia, the other was at a school in Bendigo, Victoria whilst the \\"third run\\" conducted classes in a classroom provided by a school in Hobart, Tasmania. Whilst at a location the operation of the QSTSC was autonomous from a host school though it may have been physically located within the school grounds and the pupils may have been invited to participate in activities with those of the host school. In 2010 the school had a total enrolment of 40 of whom 15% were self identified as indigenous. There were 7 teaching staff and 3 non-teaching staff. The attendance rate was 95%. In 2011 enrolments had risen to 54 of whom 7% were indigenous. The number of teachers on staff was 6 supported by 4 non-teaching staff.http://www.myschool.edu.au QSTSC attempted, so far as was practicable, to provide students with an emulation of school life as experienced by students who attended a \\"normal\\" school. Thus students followed a curriculum which conforms to the standards laid down by Education Queensland and participated in activities such as \\"Learn to Swim\\" schemes and NAPLAN testing, as well as being expected to conform to the usual uniform, attendance, punctuality and behavioral standards. Parents and Citizens Association As with most state schools in Australia, QSTSC was supported by an active P&C; which raised funds to buy additional equipment and facilities for the use of the school community. Typically the actual meetings were to be held in the locations being used by one of the runs and parents on the other run or at remote locations participated through a teleconferencing facility provided by the school. Closure The school closed in at the end of the 2012 school year, despite reported offers of funding from the Australian Federal Government and Government of New South Wales. The education minister cited poor attendance, poor results in standardized testing and the fact that most students were from outside Queensland as primary reasons for closing the school.

It was designed by the Sydney architect John Verge who also designed Camden Park and Elizabeth Bay House. The house has had some very notable residents. The building is now used as Mater Dei Special School, an inclusive school for children with intellectual disabilities, and is administered by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Wollongong. The building is open for inspection by the public. House =Sir Charles and Lady Eliza Cowper Charles Cowper built Wivenhoe in 1837 and lived there for about 30 years. During his residence at Wivenhoe he served as Premier of New South Wales five times between 1856 and 1870. Cowper was born in 1807 in Lancashire in England and was the third son of William Cowper and Hannah Horner who migrated to New South Wales when Charles was only two years old. His father was assistant colonial chaplain. Charles was educated privately and at the age of 18 he entered the Commissariat Department of the Government of New South Wales. In 1831 he married Eliza Sutton daughter of Daniel Sutton who lived in the village of Wivenhoe in Essex. The couple had six children, two sons and four daughters.NSW Births Deaths and Marriages between 1834 and 1844 In 1836 Cowper began building Wivenhoe at Camden on land that had originally been granted by the Governor of New South Wales, Lachlan Macquarie, to his father. Sketch by Conrad Martens of Wivenhoe in 1858 Soon after the house was built the Cowpers planted a vineyard which was one of the earliest in the colony. By 1850 the Wivenhoe wines were becoming celebrated with several very favourable mentions in the newspapers. In 1856 one newspaper described the wines that were produced there. These were Muscat, Riesling and red wine which they said was similar to Rhine Valley wines and Madeira which they thought was like Frontiniac. In 1858 Conrad Martens sketched of the house. In 1866 Wivenhoe was advertised for sale and the property was described in the following terms: In 1870 Cowper became Agent-General for NSW which was a position situated in London. He and Eliza sailed for England with their youngest daughter, Rose, early in 1871. Charles Cowper's health deteriorated over the next few years and in 1875 he died in Kensington, London. Lady Cowper and Rose returned to Sydney and both resided at Bowral for many years. Lady Cowper died in 1884 and was buried at St Paul's Church near Wivenhoe. Henry and Caroline Thomas Advertisement for wines produced at Wivenhoe in 1876 Henry Arding Thomas was born in 1819 in India. His father was Robert Arding Thomas, a Major in the British Army, who served in India. His mother was Caroline Gilbert. In 1856 Henry married Caroline Frances Husband in Sydney.NSW Births Deaths and Marriages Caroline was born in Devon, England, in 1833. After their marriage the couple went to live in Armidale on a property called Saumarez and had a family of five boys and six girls. While he was in Armidale, Thomas was a local magistrate, foundation president of the pastoral and Agricultural Society and involved with Anglican Church affairs. In 1874 Henry sold Saumarez and the following year he bought Wivenhoe. In 1876 an advertisement appeared in The Sydney Morning Herald for some of the wines that were produced from the Wivenhoe Vineyard. Henry died in 1884 and his widow, Caroline continued to live at Wivenhoe until her death in 1903. Walter Watt and Muriel Watt Walter Oswald Watt was born in 1878 in Bournemouth, England. His father was John Brown Watt, a merchant and a Member of the New South Wales Legislative Council, and his mother was Mary Jane Watt (n√©e Holden), who died when he was a baby. Walter Watt spent the first ten years of his life in Sydney and was sent then to be educated in England at Clifton College, Bristol, and Trinity College, Cambridge where he obtained his Bachelor and Master of Arts degrees. Watt returned to Sydney in 1900 and became second lieutenant in the New South Wales Scottish Rifles and in 1902 was appointed aide-de-camp to the Governor of New South Wales. In 1902 Watt married Muriel Maud Williams, the daughter of Sir Hartley Williams, a Justice of the Supreme Court of Victoria, and Edith Ellen Williams (n√©e Horne). The couple bought Wivenhoe in 1905 and in the same year had their only child, James. They owned the property until 1910 when they sold it to the Sisters of the Good Samaritan. In 1914, at the outbreak of World War I, Walter joined the French Foreign Legion and was awarded two military honours. In 1916 he transferred to the newly formed Australian Flying Corps and served there as captain. Orphanage and school When the Sisters of the Good Samaritan bought Wivenhoe in 1910 they made it an orphanage for the disadvantaged children in the inner city areas of Sydney. The house became part of Mater Dei, an organisation that was established by the Good Samaritan Sisters. In 1957 the Mater Dei Special School commenced using Wivenhoe as a school for children with intellectual disabilities and still serves this function today.

The New York Times, 10 March 2010. was an Anglo-American writer, teacher, and translator. The son of Dorothy Shakespear and her husband, Ezra Pound, Pound was the author of Arabic & Persian Poems (1970) and co-author of Wyndham Lewis: A Descriptive Bibliography (1978). He also wrote poems of his own and published material about his parents.Pound, Omar (2005). \\"Pound, Omar Shakespear (b. 1926)\\". In Demetres P. Tryphonopoulos and Stephen Adams (eds.). The Ezra Pound Encyclopedia. Westport, CT: Greenwood Publishing Group, 239. Early life and education Omar was born in the American Hospital of Paris, the son of artist Dorothy Shakespear and wife of the poet Ezra Pound, who were living in Italy at the time. The couple had been in Paris since June for the opening of Ezra's opera Le Testament de Villon, and had stayed on after the performance because Dorothy wanted the baby to be born at the American Hospital. Ernest Hemingway, who lived in Paris and was a friend of the Pounds, drove her there for the birth. Ezra signed the birth certificate the following day at the town hall and wrote to his father, \\"next generation (male) arrived. Both D & it appear to be doing well.\\" Omar was born 14 months after the daughter of Ezra and his mistress, violinist Olga Rudge. Dorothy took Omar to London when he was 18 months old, where she stayed for a year, then left him in the care of his maternal grandmother, Olivia Shakespear. He was sent to live in the Norland Institute, which trains nannies and used to look after young children for parents who were overseas. Ezra's parents visited Omar there in 1931. Omar lived there until 1933 before moving to the home of Ruth Ethel Dickie, the former matron of Norland, in Felpham, Sussex. In 1933 he attended a Montessori School, also in Sussex, then a local prep school. When Olivia Shakespear died in 1938, Omar met his father for the first time; Ezra was in London settling Olivia's affairs. In 1940 Omar became a boarder at Charterhouse School. He survived a bombing during World War II and the London Blitz. Career and writing=Military service After leaving Charterhouse in 1942 to train in hotel management, Pound volunteered for the U.S. Army in 1945 and served in France and Germany. He travelled to Italy looking for his father when Ezra was arrested there for treason in 1945, although he was not able to see him, and he visited his father briefly that year when Ezra was held in St. Elizabeths psychiatric hospital in Washington, D.C. He was present during one of the subsequent court hearings. Teaching and later education Later Pound attended Hamilton College in New York, his father's old college, where he studied anthropology and French, graduating in 1954 with a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree. He also studied Persian and Islamic history at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London, and in 1958 he received a Master of Arts (MA) degree in Islamic Studies from McGill University in Montreal. Pound taught at the Roxbury Latin School in Boston; the American School of Tangier, which he founded in 1950, the Cambridgeshire College of Arts and Technology; and from 1980 Princeton University. Writing Pound is the author of Arabic & Persian Poems (1970) and co- author of Wyndham Lewis: A Descriptive Bibliography (1978). He was also a founding trustee of the Wyndham Lewis Memorial Trust. His own poetry was published in The Dying Sorcerer (1985), Pissle and the Holy Grail (1987), Poems Inside and Out (1999), Watching the Worlds Go By (2001), and in literary magazines. He also published material about his parents, including Ezra Pound and Dorothy Shakespear, Their Letters 1908‚Äì1914 (1984). Personal life Pound married Elizabeth Stevenson Parkin in 1955, and they had two children, Katherine Shakespear Pound and Oriana Davenport Pound. In his biographical entry in Contemporary Authors, Pound listed both his politics and his religion as \\"nil\\". He clarified in an interview that he considered himself \\"fundamentally a mystic\\", adding \\"Even saying one doesn't have a religion is an acceptance of the mysteries of life, and I think acceptance of mysteries gives one a sense of wonder.\\" Pound died aged 83 in Princeton, New Jersey.

He appears to have gone to Spain in the years afterwards. William Burke signed himself Lord of Bealatury in Spanish documents of 1616.

The vast majority of the community works for Toyota Kirloskar, Honda, Fujitsu, Komatsu, Hitachi, Tsujikawa, Keihin, and 80 other Japanese corporates. Bangalore attracts over 1800 Japanese business visitors every month. The Karnataka government has announced to set up an industrial township on 1,000 acres of land outside Bangalore for Japanese manufacturers. The growing Japanese influence in Bangalore is exemplified by students learning Japanese at the Department of Foreign Languages at Bangalore University. Bangalore has a Japanese-influenced Sakra World Hospital, a Kenkos store for lifestyle products, and the Japanese-friendly Trio World Academy. Japan Habba (Japan Festival) has been held in Bangalore since 2005 and about 1,000 Japanese people from various parts of India travel to Bangalore to join in the festival. Many Japanese restaurants exist in Bangalore, and some are owned by Japanese people. Chennai Chennai is home to the largest Japanese community in India around 6500 members. Chennai has traditionally respected and valued Japanese culture and discipline. As of 2015, around 577 Japanese companies are present in Chennai, which represents more than a third of the Japanese companies in India. Japanese language centers have sprung up and American International School Chennai has opened a center that teaches the language; there are about 55 Japanese restaurants while hotels continue to add Japanese cuisine to their menus. The Japanese influence in the city has resulted in a keen interest in the Japanese language among the people of Chennai, who learn it to better understand Japanese culture and the language's traditional linguistic similarity to Tamil, the official language of Tamil Nadu. Some also learn Japanese to explore new business opportunities. The Indo-Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry (IJCCI) aims to increase cultural competence between India and Japan. They regularly host Japanese cultural events to expose the Chennai community to an otherwise unknown culture. Chennai has the largest number of JLPT test takers among the cities that offer the test in India. The number of Japanese expatriates is expected to rise with the development of a 1500-acre Japanese township on the outskirts of Chennai. Haldia The Japanese community of Haldia is mostly engineers and top executives at Mitsubishi Chemicals Corporation‚Äôs (MCC) PTA (Purified Terephthalic Acid) plant in the city. The community have been living in the mini Japanese township called Sataku (Japantown) for many years. Sataku has many Japanese restaurants and a local Japanese news station. Japanese movies are also shown in local theaters. Haldia is the only Indian city to have a Japantown. The only problem for tourists to this Japantown is that it is not open to public. You need to be invited as a guest of one of the residents to gain entry to the complex. Also, the exact location is not available on Google Maps and not known to most locals or local traffic police. The commissioning of the PTA plant and subsequent expansions have seen the arrival of many Japanese executives. While a few have returned, many stayed back in this quaint township, thousands of miles away from their home land. The next phase of expansion promises to bring in more Japanese expatriates to this new industrial hub in West Bengal.

It was released in 1975 by A&M; Records in both stereo (SP-4552) and CD-4 quadraphonic (QU-54552) versions. The album would peak at No. 2 on the Billboard 200 album chart, while the title song, \\"Love Will Keep Us Together\\", won the Grammy Award for Record Of The Year and was nominated for Song Of The Year. The cover of the album features a photo of Toni Tennille and Daryl Dragon sitting with two of their bulldogs. Songs The title song from the album, \\"Love Will Keep Us Together\\", was written by Neil Sedaka and Howard Greenfield, first appearing on Sedaka's 1973 LP The Tra-La Days Are Over. The Captain & Tennille cover (A&M; 1672-S b/w \\"Gentle Stranger\\") would reach No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 for the week ending June 21, 1975. It spent four weeks at number one and was ranked by Billboard as the number one single of the year, and also spent one week at number one on the Adult Contemporary chart. \\"The Way I Want To Touch You\\" (A&M; 1725 b/w \\"Broddy Bounce\\") became another million-seller, reaching #4 on the Hot 100 and topping the AC chart for two weeks. Both tracks were also top 40 hits in the U.K. although they did not replicate their Stateside success there. Dragon and Tennille first met in 1971 while Dragon was keyboardist for The Beach Boys, whom Tennille would soon join as an additional keyboardist. The album includes three songs written or co-written by (and for) The Beach Boys: \\"Cuddle Up\\", which was co-written by Dennis Wilson and Daryl Dragon in 1972; \\"God Only Knows\\", co-written by Brian Wilson and \\"Disney Girls\\", written by Bruce Johnston. The album includes the first album release of the song \\"I Write the Songs\\", also written by Beach Boy Bruce Johnston.

A fourth valley of the same name Antelope Valley lies in southern Eureka County, east of the Monitor Range. The Lander County valley lies south of the Humboldt River and with Antelope Creek, is a western tributary valley to the north-flowing Reese River. A much larger valley, of the same name in Elko and White Pine Counties, is a north-south valley surrounded by five mountain ranges, and lies on the east perimeter of the Antelope Range. A third valley that shares the name, lies in Douglas County and extends into California. Description Antelope Valley was so named on account of antelope which once roamed the area. Antelope Valley is short, about 25 mi long,Nevada Atlas & Gazetteer, DeLorme, c. 2010, p. 36-37. north- to-south, but curves slightly northeast. Antelope Creek flows through the valley north, its origins in the south where two mountain ranges merge, the New Pass Range southwest, and Ravenswood Mountain (Range), southeast. Antelope Creek disappears in flatlands in the northern third of the valley, where the valley widens somewhat, as the narrow and short, western perimeter Augusta Mountains turn slightly northwestwards. A separate creek originates from the flatland in the valley's north, Cain Creek and traverses about 12 mi northeast to the Reese River. A separate south-flowing creek flows into the Cain Creek headwaters (flatlands), the Cottonwood Creek from the southern, and central Fish Creek Mountains. The center-east of the valley is adjacent Antelope Butte, on a small separated ridge in the foothills from the northwest of Ravenswood Mountain. Access The shortest access to Antelope Valley is made from the south, Nevada Route 305, from Austin, Nevada. The route parallels the Reese River and the valley's north end lies about 40 mi north of Austin, then 10 mi west on unimproved roads.

The expanded use of the power under section 96 has added to Australia's vertical fiscal imbalance and enabled the Commonwealth to have a significant influence over matters that would otherwise be constitutionally State responsibilities.  Text Tied grants Section 51 of the Australian Constitution enumerates the legislative powers of Commonwealth, with the residual powers being those of the States. However, section 96 provides the Commonwealth with the power to grant money to any state. These monetary grants are typically tied to certain terms and conditions (often legislative) that the states must adhere to in order to receive the grant. As these grants are linked to a particular purpose, they are known as 'tied grants'. In practice, section 96 has provided the Commonwealth parliament with the ability to influence policy matters that lie within the residual powers of the States (e.g. education, health, water, etc.). Vertical fiscal imbalance Although the Australian Constitution allows both States and the Commonwealth to raise revenue, subsequent political developments and judicial interpretations have limited state taxing powers and led to Australia's vertical fiscal imbalance. The Commonwealth has significantly greater revenue- raising abilities than the states, which have spending responsibilities. The result is that states rely on Commonwealth grants to fund state-provided services such as schools and hospitals. The power to distribute funds to states on conditions has expanded the sphere of Commonwealth power through dictating policy through conditional grants. This limits the autonomy and power of the states in controlling policy. This is largely due to the uniform federal system of income tax that was introduced in 1942 in accordance with s51(ii). Additionally, Section 51(iv) grants the Commonwealth control over state borrowings, furthering the reliance of the States on Commonwealth funding. The vertical fiscal imbalance, alongside section 96 of the Australian Constitution has effectively extended the Commonwealth's powers beyond those enumerated in section 51 of the Australian Constitution and other explicit enumerations of Commonwealth legislative power (e.g. section 52 and section 90). Use of s.96 to take over State income taxing power Before 1942, consistent with the concurrent power in s51(ii), both the states and the Commonwealth levied income taxes. However, in 1942 the Commonwealth attempted to gain a monopoly on income taxes by passing the Income Tax Act 1942 and the States Grants (Income Tax Reimbursement) Act 1942. The Income Tax Act imposed a Commonwealth income tax, while the Grants Act provided Commonwealth funding to the States on condition that they do not imposed an income tax, based on section 96 of the Australian Constitution. The Income Tax Act 1942 set high tax rates that reflected the combined current Commonwealth and State taxes and made imposing State tax unattractive or impossible. This was because the Income Tax Assessment Act 1942 said that individuals had to pay Commonwealth tax before State taxes. In effect, the scheme meant either the States had to accept grants and stop taxing, or decline grants and try to collect tax at rates which were unsustainable. The High Court has interpreted the expression \\"terms and conditions\\" very broadly. In South Australia v Commonwealth (1942) 65 CLR 373 (the First Uniform Tax case) the scheme was upheld. There was an opinion that the scheme, introduced in 1942, was upheld on the basis of the defence power in section 51(vi). The Commonwealth re-enacted the scheme after the war.

It runs from Oberhausen via Duisburg-Meiderich to Duisburg- Ruhrort. The line is now classified as a main line, although it is not electrified and west of Duisburg-Meiderich Sud station it is entirely single- track. History  The Cologne-Minden Railway Company (C√∂ln-Mindener Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft, CME) opened the first railway in the Ruhr with the completion of its trunk line in 1847. This allowed coal mined in the Ruhr to be brought to consumers in the Lower Rhine. It entered into a contract with the Ruhrort-Crefeld District Gladbach Railway Company (Ruhrort‚ÄìCrefeld‚àíKreis Gladbach Eisenbahngesellschaft, RCG) to build a line to Ruhrort and to establish a train ferry between Ruhrort and Homberg. The RCG agreed to build a line from Homberg to M√∂nchengladbach. The CME opened its branch line from Oberhausen Station via Meiderich to Ruhrort on 14 October 1848. Under the contract the train ferry was to become operational within four years of the completion of the line. Development  After the Bergisch-M√§rkische Railway Company (Bergisch-M√§rkische Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft, BME) took over the RCG, together with the Aachen-Neu√ü-D√ºsseldorf Railway Company (Aachen-Neu√ü- D√ºsseldorfer Eisenbahngesellschaft) of the Royal Directorate of the Aachen- D√ºsseldorf-Ruhrort Railway Company (K√∂nigliche Direction der Aachen- D√ºsseldorf-Ruhrorter Eisenbahn) in 1866, it built a line to Ruhrort, starting from its M√ºlheim-Styrum station. This meant that BME lines connected to the ferry terminals on both shores, and so the CME line to Oberhausen abruptly lost its usefulness. After the Duisburg-Hochfeld rail bridge was opened over the Rhine on the Osterath‚ÄìDortmund S√ºd line, the old Ruhrort‚ÄìHomberg train ferry became completely run down and the line lost its national significance; instead, it was used for the transport of goods to the steel industry and the port of Duisburg-Ruhrort. Current situation  The railway lines built during the 19th century in areas that are now incorporated in the city of Duisburg do not reflect the current passenger traffic flows of the current population and this line has only limited usefulness for passenger transport. In the past, freight mainly ran on the line between Duisburg-Ruhrorter Hafen (harbour) freight yard and the large Oberhausen West freight yard (formerly the Oberhausen RHE station). The Duisburg-Wedau‚ÄìBottrop S√ºd line of the former Rhenish Railway Company (Rheinische Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft, RHE) connected the two freight yards. Today the harbour yard is only connected to the east to the Duisburg-Wedau‚ÄìBottrop S√ºd line. Rail service  The Regionalbahn service RB 36 (Ruhrort-Bahn) was, until recently, operated by the Prignitzer Eisenbahn (PEG), owned by Arriva. The travel time for the whole line is twelve minutes.

Personal life Alexander Bugge was son of the Norwegian philologist and historian Sophus Bugge and Karen Sophie, n√©e Schreiner. On 16 December 1903 he married Marie Magdalene Graff. Career In the biography written for Norsk biografisk leksikon, Claus Krag described Bugge as having \\"an open and restlessly seeking mind\\", a trait he shared with his father who according to Krag was \\"one of the few genuine scholars of genius in Norwegian science\\". After passing his university exams in language and history in 1894, Bugge obtained a university scholarship the following year. In 1898, at the age of 28, he became a member of Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters. In 1899 he published his thesis Studier over de norske byers selvstyre og handel f√∏r Hanseaternes tid (\\"Studies Concerning the Norwegian Cities' Autonomy and Trade Before the Time of the Hanseatic League\\"), and obtained his dr.philos. degree. Bugge won an essay competition sponsored by the Nansen Foundation in 1903 on the question \\"How or to which extend have the Norse, and particularly the Norwegians, culture, way of living and society been influenced from the Western Countries [i.e. the British Isles]\\". During his work with this he learned the Irish language and did extensive studies of archives in Dublin and London. Bugge succeeded Gustav Storm as professor of history at the Royal Frederick University in the summer of 1903. He published numerous scientific articles, his main sources being the early development of Norwegian cities and trade as well the cultural relations in the time of the Vikings. He also edited and translated into English the complex Irish tract Caithr√©im Chellach√°in Chaisil (The Victorious Career of Cellach√°n of Cashel), published in 1905. In addition to these scholarly works, he also contributed several popularly adapted works on history, such as his two volume work Vikingerne (\\"The Vikings\\") from 1905-06 and part of Aschehoug's Norges historie (\\"History of Norway\\"), published 1910-12 concerning the time before the Battle of Stiklestad in 1030. Despite recognition as an excellent scholar and popular author, Bugge was not comfortable with his work as professor. According to Halvdan Koht, \\"being a teacher cost him [Bugge] unspeakable hardships... ...in the end making him sick\\"Full quote in Norwegian: \\"Det kosta han eit useieleg strev √• vere l√¶rar, han kunde ikkje sleppe seg laus og gje seg fritt og friskt inn i arbeide med studentane, katetre vart beint fram ein redsel for han, s√• han til slutt vart reint sjuk\\" According to Claus Krag, he also in suffered periods of serious problems related to alcohol. Bugge resigned his professorship in 1912. He remained a scholar and writer, giving lectures and publishing popular works on Norwegian history. Among other works, he published Illustreret verdenshistorie for hjemmet (\\"Illustrated World History for the Home\\"), in 9 volumes with more than 4000 pages, in the period 1920-29.

The garden was opened on 24 November 2010 by then chief Minister Dr.M. Karunanidhi and is the first botanical garden in the city. The garden is located in the Cathedral Road‚ÄìAnna Salai junction, opposite the American Consulate, on the erstwhile Drive-in Woodlands Hotel. Encompassing an area of 20 acres (320 grounds), it was built at a cost of 80 million. More than 500 species of plants are being grown in the area, in addition to the 80 trees that was already in existence during the development of the park, some of them being more than 100 years old. The garden houses some of the popular exotic flora and rare plant species, medicinal and aromatic herbs. Many of the exotic plants are imported from countries like China and Thailand, including a plethora of bonsai varieties of ficus microcarpa and ficus ginseng. History Walkway at the park The area in which the botanical garden stands today was formerly the location of the Woodlands Drive-In restaurant, the city's first drive-in restaurant, and the Agri-Horticultural Society. In April 1962, the Agri-Horticultural Society sub-leased the 18-acre land to hotelier K. Krishna Rau, who started the Woodlands Drive-in Hotel on 15 April 1962. It was an extension of the \\"Woodlands\\" brand, then popular in the city as the only \\"Indian hotel.\\" In 1982, the annual Chennai Book Fair conducted by BAPASI was held in the hotel premises. Early in 1989, the Tamil Nadu Government had set in motion the closure of the restaurant. After almost two decades, the restaurant ended its operation on 12 April 2008, and through a High Court order after a prolonged legal battle, the land was handed over to the government, where it planned to set up the botanical garden, a research centre and a green house for developing rare species of medicinal and non-medicinal plants and flowers. On 13 November 2009, the Supreme Court gave its consent to the state government to set up the garden. The garden has been christened such to commemorate the Classical Tamil Conference, which was held earlier in 2010. The cost of the land was valued at more than 10,000 million at the time of opening. The government appointed a city-based firm of architects‚ÄîRajendra Associates‚Äîas consultant to design, supervise and manage the project. The garden Artificial pond at the garden Ducks swimming in the pond The garden features eight subgardens displaying flora of different varieties, such as a tree court, mural walk and bonsai, herbal and exotic gardens, in addition to an artificial duck pond. Incorporating elements of an Indian-Buddhist garden, the garden has a wide variety of indigenous species across 22 exclusive areas including palm court, tree court, golden garden (featuring plants that flower in different shades of gold), water and rock garden, butterfly garden, fern garden, sunken garden and theme garden. Twenty-five thematic gardens, including herbal, aromatic, maze and cascade adorn every corner of the park. The garden boasts several exotic herbal species and 90-odd spiral-shaped and multi-branched miniature trees grown in containers. The Bonsai garden is dotted with trees whose height range from 1 foot to 4 feet. At the fag end of the park is the Cascade garden. Flower at the garden The arch near the entrance plaza is a vertical garden which is a unique feature of the botanical garden. The vertical garden, with an inbuilt irrigation and drain system for easy maintenance, is 22 feet long and 14 feet high intended to improve the scenic beauty of the park at the entrance. The arch is covered by 7,000 plants from 35 different species including dracena, lilies, ophiopogon, schefflera, phyllodendron and flowering plants like krishnagantha. The 10-feet-high green wall has plants raised in a poly trace imported from Canada. Micro-tube irrigation has been arranged for watering the plants. The plants cling to the 700-sq.ft. wall, which serves as the entry point. A butterfly garden near the cascade fountains along the Anna flyover has been carved up into the shape of a butterfly, with flowering plants of more than 30 species completely fenced. The aroma garden acts as a welcoming greenhouse for winged visitors, with species like parijatham and pavalamalli (Nyctanthes arbor-tristis) found to flock the place in bulk. An amphitheatre with concrete benches and covered by ferns has been built on the rear side of garden to host social and cultural functions. Other features of the garden include disabled-friendly ramps, a mural walk-through, and areas dotted with fountains, vertical gardens, ponds and cascades. Poonga at night with dancing lights In the course of the construction, the garden has received nearly 800,000 worth plants from China. These include flowering cacti that have a velvety, light pink at the top, non- flowering cacti with diameters up to about 45 cm, 'lucky' bamboo, ficus and bonsai varieties. The cacti were planted in the cacti garden decorated with white marble chips, pebbles and rocks from Porbandar. The garden also received water lilies from Thailand and 12 varieties of orchids. There is also a plan to build a 10-ft-high monolithic structure, with 'Semmozhi Poonga' carved on it to welcome the visitors. There is an open auditorium in the garden, which is available on hire, to organise functions. Maintenance Located at the central business district of Chennai, the park attracts several visitor and film crews for filming in the location. This has created maintenance problem, whereby there are complaints that the cinema shooting crews made a dent in the park's salubrious environs by damaging tender plants. Visitor information The garden remains open for morning walkers from 6 am to 8 am. For visitors, the park remains open from 10 am through 8 pm on all days except Tuesdays. There is an open auditorium available within the garden which can be hired to organise functions. The garden has a parking lot that can accommodate around 100 cars and more than 500 two-wheelers. An entry fee of 15 is collected from all people above 10 years of age or 130 cm height. For the early morning walk, the entry is permitted only for monthly pass holders, for which 150 is charged.

It stars George Arliss (in his last feature film), Margaret Lockwood, Graham Moffatt and Ronald Shiner.BFI.org The film is based on the Doctor Syn novels of Russell Thorndike, set in 18th century Kent. The character of Syn and the events at the film's climax were both softened considerably in comparison to Thorndike's original story. Plot Led by Captain Collyer (Roy Emerton), a detachment of Royal Navy tax and revenue officers arrive in the village of Dymchurch on Romney Marsh. The area is notorious for liquor-smuggling and they are on the trail of the culprits. They find a village of apparently honest, pious and simple folk, looked after benevolently by their philanthropic vicar Doctor Syn (Arliss). Syn is in fact the leader of the smugglers of the parish, using his cover as a man of the cloth to run a profitable ring whose dividends are used to better the lives of the local community. Collyer gradually comes to suspect what is going on, and a series of chases and confrontations takes place across the marshes, in which Syn and the smugglers always narrowly outwit their pursuers. Collyer finally discovers that Syn is none other than the notorious pirate Captain Clegg, thought to have been executed many years earlier. Still one step ahead, Syn destroys all incriminating evidence and he and his men make their escape.

The Diamond coconut model is an economic model constructed by the American economist and 2010 Nobel laureate Peter Diamond which analyzes how a search economy in which traders cannot find partners instantaneously operates. The model was first presented in a 1982 paper published in the Journal of Political Economy. The main implication of the model is that people's expectations as to the level of aggregate activity play a crucial role in actually determining this level of aggregate economic activity. A frequent interpretation of its conclusion, as applied to the labor market, is that the so-called natural rate of unemployment may not be unique (in fact there may exist a continuum of \\"natural rates\\") and even if it is unique, it may not be efficient. Diamond's model was of interest to New Keynesian economists who saw it as potential source of coordination failure, which could cause markets to fail to clear.\\"Mankiw, N Gregory and Romer, David. \\"Introduction.\\" New Keynesian Economics. Vol. 1. 1991. The model takes its name from the abstract set up imagined by Diamond. He envisioned an island (a closed economy) populated by individuals who only consume coconuts. Coconuts are obtained by being picked (they are \\"produced\\") from palm trees at a cost. Because of a particular taboo existing on this island a person who has picked a coconut cannot consume it themselves but must find another person with a coconut. At that point the two individuals can trade their respective coconuts and eat them. The key point is that when an individual finds a palm tree, because climbing the tree is costly, they will only be willing to climb it to get a coconut if there are a sufficiently high number of other individuals who are willing to do likewise. If nobody else is obtaining coconuts then there won't be any potential trading partners and obtaining coconuts is not worth climbing the tree. Hence, what individuals believe others will do plays a crucial role in determining the overall outcome. As a result, people's (fully rational) expectations become a self-fulfilling prophecy and the economy can wind up with multiple equilibria, most if not all of them characterized by inefficiency. Population flows in the model The agents in the model are always in one of two \\"states\\"; they are either currently carrying a coconut and looking for someone to trade it with, or they are searching for a palm tree in order to possibly pick a coconut. The number of agents who are carrying a coconut at time t is denoted by e(t) (for \\"employed\\") and they find trading partners at the rate b(e(t)) at which point they trade coconuts, earn income y and become \\"searchers\\". The fact that the probability of finding a trading partner is increasing in the number of people who already have coconuts - mathematically b '(e)>0 \\\\- represents a \\"thick market externality\\"; the \\"thicker\\" the market in the sense of more potential traders, the more trades occur. It involves an externality because each person who chooses to pick a coconut does so with only their own self-interest in mind, but the fact that they do so has an effect on the overall social outcome. Population flows in the model People who are currently looking for coconut palm trees find these at a random rate f. This means that the finding of palm trees follows a Poisson process characterized by the parameter f. If total population is normalized to 1 (hence, e(t) is the share of the population that is employed) then the number of searchers in this economy is 1-e(t). The figure above illustrates the population flows in this economy. The value of having a coconut or looking for one Each state can be thought of as a form of an asset, for example, the asset \\"having a coconut\\". The present discounted value of this asset depends on the benefit or cost incurred when a person finds a trading partner or a palm tree (this is like a one time dividend payment), and the capital gain (or loss) involved in switching states when a trade or coconut-picking occurs. Additionally, out of steady state, the value of the asset may fluctuate over time. Mathematically, the present discounted value of having a coconut is given by :r V_e = b(e)(y+V_u- V_e)+\\\\frac {dV_e} {dt} where V_e is the value of having a coconut, V_u is the value of being in the state \\"looking for a palm tree\\", y is the gain to be realized upon finding a trading partner and r is the discount rate which measures individual's impatience. Likewise, the present discounted value of searching for palm trees is given by :r V_u = f(-E(c)+V_e-V_u)+\\\\frac {dV_u} {dt} where f is the rate at which searchers find palm trees, and E(c) is the expected cost (hence it enters with a minus sign) of climbing a palm tree when one is found. In the general version of the model, the cost of climbing a palm tree is a random draw from some (publicly known) probability distribution with non-negative support, for example the uniform distribution on (c_{low},c_{hi}). This means that on the island \\"some trees are tall and some are short\\", and as a result picking coconuts from them can be hard or easy. Simple mathematical version of the model In the most simple version of Diamond's model, the probability of finding a trading partner‚Äîanother person who's carrying a coconut‚Äîis exactly equal to the share of the population that is currently in possession of a coconut, b(e)=e. Additionally the cost of obtaining a coconut when one finds a palm tree is constant, at c (this is the \\"all trees are of the same height\\" assumption). The evolution of the proportion of people who are currently carrying coconuts and looking for trading partners is given by: :\\\\frac {de} {dt}=f(1-e)-b(e) e=f(1-e)-e^2 if every searcher who finds a palm tree chooses to climb it and obtain a coconut, and :\\\\frac {de} {dt}=-e^2 if every searcher who finds a palm tree chooses not to obtain a coconut when coming upon the opportunity of doing so. In the first equation f(1-e) is just the number of searchers who happen to find a palm tree at a particular time t (the \\"inflow\\" of coconut carriers), while e^2 is the number of previous coconut-carriers who managed to successfully find a trading partner and hence reverted to being searchers (the \\"outflow\\"). In the second equation, since nobody ever bothers to climb a tree and obtain coconuts, the number of coconut-carriers simply declines over time. The two potential adjustment paths are illustrated in the figure below. Basic diagram of the Diamond model showing two possible adjustment paths. The steady state In the steady state of this economy, the number of searchers and the number of coconut carriers has to be constant, \\\\frac {de} {dt}=0. Hence there are two possible steady state in the simple version of the model. The \\"bad\\" outcome where nobody who finds a palm tree picks a coconut so that e^*=0 and an interior equilibrium where e^*=(1/2)(-f+ \\\\sqrt {f^2+4f}). The bad results occurs if everyone who finds a palm tree believes that not enough other people will pick coconuts and as a result it is not worth it to pick the coconut themselves. This then becomes a pessimistic self-fulfilling belief. Whether or not the good outcome is possible depends on parameter values, and as these determine the value of each asset in steady state. In this case the value of the assets will be constant so that \\\\frac {dV_e} {dt}=\\\\frac {dV_u} {dt}=0 and we can solve for the difference between V_e and V_u: :V_e-V_u=\\\\frac {ey+fc} {r+e+f} For it to be worth it to climb a palm tree this difference has to be greater than the cost of climbing a tree. If e^*=0 we have fc/(r+f)>c which means no one will want to pick coconuts. Hence e=0 is indeed an equilibrium. Otherwise we need e>\\\\frac {rc} {y-c}. Note that this e is independent of f while the e^* given above is a function of f only. This means that the critical value of e could be below or above the \\"good\\" steady state value. If costs of climbing the tree are high, or the agents are very impatient (high r) then e=0 will be the only equilibrium. If c and r are low then there will be two equilibria, and which one the economy winds up at will depend on initial conditions (the level of employment that the economy begins with).

It took place in New York Harbor and consisted of a best-of-five series of races between the defender Resolute, entered by a syndicate of New York Yacht Club members headed by Henry Walters, and Shamrock IV, the fourth in Sir Thomas Lipton's line of Cup challengers. Despite being disabled in the first race and losing the second, Resolute won the final three races and in doing so retained the Cup on behalf of the NYYC, continuing the club's unbroken record of defending the America's Cup. The 1920 America's Cup was originally scheduled to take place in 1914 but was postponed upon the outbreak of World War I. The 13th Cup challenge was the last to take place in New York, and the first held under the Universal Rule of measurement. Due to the rule, Shamrock IV owed Resolute seven minutes time. Lipton challenges a fourth time Following his unsuccessful Cup challenge in 1903, Lipton, founder of the Lipton tea company, attempted to persuade the NYYC to adopt new rules of measurement for America's Cup yachts that would reduce their cost, which was widely seen to be a result of the Seawanhaka rule then used by the club. Despite the NYYC having adopted the new Universal Rule in 1903, formulated by Nathaniel Herreshoff, for its own races, it was reluctant to allow its use for America's Cup races and refused several challenges issued by Lipton until finally accepting in 1913. Trials Resolute leading Vanitie at start of first elimination race off New Haven 1920. The 1914 defender selection trials pitted Resolute against Vanitie. In winning, Resolute set a course record. The races were suspended as World War I broke out and did not resume until 1920, at which point Resolute again secured her place as defender in trials against Vanitie. Race The American defender Resolute won 3-2 against the challenger Shamrock IV. During the first race, Shamrock IV crossed the line ahead of the start, having to circle back around and provide an early lead to Resolute. However, later in the race the shackle holding Resolute's mainsail broke, forcing the boat to complete the race only under jib. This provided Lipton with his first America's Cup victory, although he refused to celebrate the win. The second race was without incident and Shamrock IV won by a corrected two minutes ahead of Resolute. The following three races were under lighter conditions, which disadvantaged Shamrock IV and allowed Resolute to win. Police estimated that over 75,000 people watched the final race.

Life He was born in Vilnius, Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (now in Lithuania), in 1762. At an early age, he was violinist at the Polish Royal Chapel, after which he travelled to Vienna about 1785 to see and listen to Haydn and Mozart. From Austria, he accompanied a Polish princess to Italy, to refine his artistic abilities with the Italian masters of that day, where he lived for three years. In Paris, he appeared at the Concerts Spirituels in December 1787, and was described in the Mercure de France as a pupil of the Italian violinist Giovanni Giornovich and was immediately recognised by the Parisians as an artist of high rank. There he was employed by the Duc d'Orl√©ans and for a short time he enjoyed the pension of a musician on the establishment of Mlle. d'Orl√©ans; on the outbreak of the revolution he left France for London in 1790 and did not reappear until his 1792 London debut at Salomon's Concerts among others. During the subsequent years he expanded his violin performances and musical pursuits to Manchester, Liverpool, and Ireland. In Liverpool, he met Miss Breeze, whom he married in 1800. Janiewicz played at Corri's house in London in January 1792, and at Growetz's concert on 9 February, giving a benefit concert in the same month. He performed his violin concerto at the Salomon's Concerts of 17 February and 3 May (for Haydn's benefit). During several seasons Janiewicz played in London, visited the provinces and Ireland as a violinist, and conducted the subscription concerts in Manchester and Liverpool. He was one of the original members of the London Philharmonic Society, and in the first season (1813) was one of the leaders of the orchestra. For a time he kept a music-warehouse at 25 Lord Street, Liverpool, and married Miss Breeze of that town in 1800. In 1815 he went to Edinburgh. From 1815, he was resident in Edinburgh.

The fruit bodies, or mushrooms, have conic to bell-shaped to convex caps that are initially dark brown but fade to brownish- gray when young, reaching diameters of up to . They are typically wrinkled or somewhat grooved, and have reddish-brown spots in age, or after being cut or bruised. The whitish to pale gray gills also become spotted reddish-brown as they mature. The stem, up to long and covered with whitish hairs at its base, can also develop reddish stains. The mycelium of M. maculata has bioluminescent properties. The saprobic fungus is found in Europe and North America, where it grows in groups or clusters on the rotting wood of both hardwoods and conifers. The edibility of the fungus is unknown. Although the species is known for, and named after its propensity to stain reddish, occasionally these stains do not appear, making it virtually indistinguishable from M. galericulata. Taxonomy and naming The species was first described scientifically by the German mycologist Petter Karsten in 1890. The name Mycena maculata was also used by the Australian mycologist John Burton Cleland in 1934, but that usage was considered illegitimate, and the species he described has since been renamed to Mycena austromaculata by Cheryl Grgurinovic and Tom May in 1997. The specific epithet maculata is derived from the Latin word \\"spotted\\". The mushroom is commonly known as the \\"reddish- spotted Mycena\\". Description The whitish gills develop reddish-brown stains as they mature. The cap of M. maculata varies in shape from broadly conic to convex initially, soon expanding to bell-shaped or broadly convex at maturity; when expanded the cap diameter is typically between . It usually has a distinct umbo, which can be abruptly convex in some individuals and very broad and low in others. The cap margin closely approaches the stem when young, but often flares or curves upward with age. The cap surface is smooth, slimy to the touch, often opaque when young but becomes partially translucent so that the outlines of the gills underneath the cap may be seen nearly to the center, before fading. It is often somewhat wrinkled or has the radial gill grooves deepening with age. It is initially dirty blackish-brown or nearly black, becoming paler dirty brown to brownish-gray with age, and usually with reddish-brown spots. The flesh is somewhat thick under the umbo, but becomes abruptly thinner over the area of the margin (about 0.15 mm). It is cartilaginous and firm, dark or pale watery gray, changing slowly to dirty reddish-brown when cut or bruised. It has no distinguishable odor, and a taste ranging from mild to slightly farinaceous (like flour). The gills are bluntly adnate, later becoming toothed and somewhat sinuate. The gills are narrow, becoming moderately broad (4‚Äì5 mm), whitish to pale gray in color, soon staining with reddish spots. Sometimes the gills separate slightly from the cap, but remain attached to each other to form a collar. The gill spacing is close to subdistant, with about 17‚Äì24 gills reaching the stem; there are additionally about three tiers of lamellulae (short gills that do not extend fully from the cap margin to the stem). The stem is usually long and thick, occasionally much longer, often with a long pseudorhiza (a cordlike structure resembling a plant root) that can root into the substrate. The stem is densely covered with sharp, stiff white hairs on the lower portion, and smooth above. It is sometimes twisted, nearly equal in width throughout, hollow, and cartilaginous. The top portion of the stem is pallid, while the remainder is the same color or paler than the cap. The stem base becomes stained reddish- brown to purplish, or the entire lower portion turns a dirty wine red.Smith, 1947, pp. 341‚Äì43. The edibility of the mushroom is unknown. Microscopic characteristics The spores are ellipsoid, amyloid (meaning they turn bluish-black to black when stained with Melzer's reagent), and measure 7‚Äì9 by 4‚Äì5 Œºm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells in the hymenium) are 30‚Äì35 by 7‚Äì8 Œºm, and four-spored. The cheilocystidia (cystidia on the gill edge) are embedded in the hymenium and inconspicuous, measuring 20‚Äì28 by 6‚Äì12 Œºm. They are irregular in form; some have short rodlike projections on the upper part, others have irregular branched finger-like protuberances, while others have wavy walls and an elongated contorted apex. There are no pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill face) in Mycena maculata. The gill tissue is hyaline or very faintly vinaceous-brown when stained in iodine. The cap tissue has a thin pellicle, and the region directly under it is made of hyphae with only slightly enlarged cells, while the remainder is filamentous, and stains yellowish to slightly vinaceous-brown in iodine. The mycelium of M. maculata is bioluminescent; this property has not been reported for the fruit bodies. Similar species In the absence of the characteristic reddish staining (particularly in young specimens), M. maculata is indistinguishable in the field from M. galericulata, which also tends to grow in groups or tufts on wood. Microscopically, the latter species has larger spores, ranging from 8‚Äì12 by 5.5‚Äì9 Œºm. Another Mycena that stains reddish is M. inclinata; it can be distinguished by its slightly larger spores, typically 7‚Äì9 by 5‚Äì6.5 Œºm, and the white flecks that develop on the lower part of the stem. It is common in eastern North America, and prefers to grows on decaying hardwood.Smith, pp. 338‚Äì40. M. haematopus also grows in clusters on wood, but can be differentiated by its scalloped cap margin, a stem which bleeds a reddish juice when cut or broken, and a preference for growing on hardwoods. M. purpureofusca has a purplish cap, gills with purple edges, and usually grows on pine cones. M. atrochalybaea, a species known from Italy and Switzerland, has more gills that reach the stem (usually between 30 and 40), smooth hyphae in the cortical layer of the stem, and smooth, uninflated cystidia. Distribution and habitat The fruit bodies of M. maculata grow in groups to clumps on the wood and debris of both coniferous and deciduous trees. The fungus is found in North America and Europe (Germany and Norway). The North American distribution ranges north from Quebec, Canada, south to Mexico. Mycena specialist Alexander H. Smith, in his 1947 monograph on the genus, called it \\"the most abundant Mycena on conifer wood in the Pacific Northwest.\\" It has also been recorded as a new species in Turkey (Kahramanmara≈ü district) in 2006.

He performed on radio programs and in Hollywood musicals in the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s. He became most noted as the sideman and musical accompanist to Bob Hope and Frances Langford during their USO tours in World War II, Korean, and Vietnam wars. Early life Romano was born in Madera, California, one of nine children of an Italian immigrant shoemaker. According to Romano, his father played violin and guitar, and the entire family was musical. He said, \\"In our family, if you didn't sing, you didn't eat.\\" In his youth, he played violin but took up the guitar after being inspired by Eddie Lang. At 17, Romano moved to Hollywood where he studied guitar with Paramount Studio's guitarist George Smith. Career Romano (right) with Hal Block, Bob Hope, Barney Dean, George Patton and Frances Langford during World War II Romano built his career as a guitarist and singer for radio programs and Hollywood movie productions in the 1930s. He first worked on the Al Pearce radio program, then at Warner Brothers, where he composed arrangements for Dick Powell. Romano's 16-piece orchestra was the feature band for Morey Amsterdam and Mabel Todd's radio show. He also worked on the Lucky Strike Hit Parade, at 20th Century Fox and later on the Pepsodent radio show for NBC. In September 1942, Bob Hope asked Romano to accompany him on his initial USO tour to entertain troops at bases in Alaska and the Aleutians. Hope had already enlisted singer Frances Langford and comedian Jerry Colonna but needed a musician and asked Colonna for a recommendation. Colonna said, \\"Get Tony Romano. Best guitar in the business.\\" The foursome of Hope, Langford, comedian Jack Pepper and Romano performed in England, Sicily, North Africa and the South Pacific during World War II. They also toured in 1948 during the Berlin Airlift and in Korea in the 1950s. During the Vietnam War, Romano accompanied Langford without Hope on USO circuit tours in Southeast Asia. In between USO tours, Romano performed on several programs, including the Jack Carson radio show and recorded his own music (his recording Stars Fell on Alabama was a hit in 1956) as well as arranged songs for Johnny Mercer, Bing Crosby and others. Personal life Romano was married to singer/actress Barbara Hayden. They had two children, Richard Niles and Lisa Hayden-Miller. Romano was married to Evelyn Collette from 1964 until his death in 2005. They had one child Regina Marie Romano Deese.
