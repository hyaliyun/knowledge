She was one of the most influential Slovenian intellectuals in the 1980s, and was frequently called \\"the First Lady of Slovenian Democratic Opposition\\", and \\"the Voice of Slovenian Spring\\"Jože Pirjevec, Jugoslavija: 1918-1992. Nastanek, razvoj ter razpad Karađorđevićeve in Titove Jugoslavije (Koper: Založba Lipa, 1995), 382-383. She is married to the Slovenian Heideggerian philosopher Tine Hribar. Early life She was born Spomenka Diklić in Belgrade, then the capital of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, to a Serb father (Radenko Diklić) and a Slovene mother (Marija Jelica Mravlje). Her father died at the Glavnjača prison, where the opponents of the collaborationist state of Milan Nedić were imprisoned. After World War II, she moved with her mother to Slovenia, then part of the Yugoslavia. She spent her childhood in the village of Žiri. After finishing high school in Škofja Loka, she enrolled at the University of Ljubljana, where she studied philosophy and sociology. She graduated in 1965 with a thesis on Marx's concept of freedom. Between 1965-66, she was co-editor of the student magazine Tribuna. Under her solicitation, the magazine became one of the first Yugoslav student journals which also published pieces by students of theology. Among the young theologians sponsored by Hribar was also Anton Stres, later archbishop of Ljubljana who shared the same scholarly interest as Hribar in the Marxist and Hegelian conceptions of freedom. In 1969, she got a job at the Institute for Sociology of the University of Ljubljana. Although a member of the Communist Party, she grew alienated from Marxism in the 1970s. Under the influence of the literary historian Dušan Pirjevec and the philosopher Tine Hribar, whom she later married, she developed an interest in the phenomenological philosophy of Martin Heidegger. In 1975, after the poet and thinker Edvard Kocbek publicly denounced the mass killings of Slovene Home Guard members by the Communist regime after World War II, she dedicated most of her intellectual endeavours to the understanding and explaining what she called the tragedy of Slovenian resistance and revolution during and after World War II. The public intellectual In the 1980s, Spomenka and her husband Tine Hribar became important members of a newly formed circle of critical Slovene intellectuals, gathered around the journal Nova revija. In 1983, she started writing the essay \\"Guilt and Sin\\" (Krivda in greh), which became one of the most influential texts in post-war Slovenia. In the essay, meant for publishing in a collective volume on Edvard Kocbek, she denounced the mass killings in Slovenia after World War II. In early 1984, the essay leaked to the officials of the League of Communists of Slovenia. In September of the same year, shortly before the planned issue of the volume, the official Slovenian press launched a campaign against Spomenka Hribar, accusing her of counter-revolutionary attitudes and slander against the partisan resistance. In 1985, she was expelled from the Communist Party. Despite the denigration campaign, many important public figures rose to her defence, including the sociologist Pavle Gantar. In this period, she was first called \\"the Slovene Antigone\\", an epitome that has stuck to her since then. In 1987, she was a co- author of the Contributions for the Slovenian National Program, a collective text in which several Slovene public intellectuals and scholars demanded a sovereign and democratic Slovenian state. Political activism In 1989, she was one of the co-founders of the Slovenian Democratic Union, one of the first anti-Communist parties in Slovenia. Together with her husband Tine Hribar and the jurists France Bučar and Peter Jambrek She became one of the party's foremost theoreticians. In the first free elections in Slovenia in April 1990, won by the Democratic Opposition of Slovenia, she was elected to the Slovenian Parliament. Between 1990 and 1991, she was very active in the endeavours for the secession of Slovenia from Yugoslavia. Together with Jože Pučnik, she emerged as the leader of the DEMOS coalition majority in the Lower Chamber of the Slovenian Parliament. At the same time, she grew increasingly critical to the right wing of the DEMOS coalition, embodied by the Slovene Christian Democrats, whom she accused of backing the Roman Catholic Church and favouring their own sectarian vision of neo-conservative revisionism against the common endeavours for Slovenian independence from Yugoslavia. After the Ten-Day War, Hribar turned against the conservative wing of her own party, the Slovenian Democratic Union. The clash resulted in the split of the party between the social liberal Democratic Party and the liberal conservative National Democratic Party, which occurred in late 1991. In 1992, Hribar was among those who pushed for the dissolution of the DEMOS coalition, and backed the formation of a centre left government under the Liberal Democrat Janez Drnovšek.  Public figure after 1992 Before the elections of 1992, Spomenka Hribar caused a famous controversy with the article \\"Stopping the Right Wing\\" (Zaustaviti desnico, sometimes erroneously rendered as an imperative, Zaustavite desnico, that is \\"Stop the Right Wing!\\"). In the article, she warned against the rise of right wing discourse in post-independence Slovenia. After the failure of the Democratic Party in 1992, Hribar withdrew from party politics, but remained in public life as a commentator and columnist. In her articles, she has stood up for various left liberal values in various contexts, from bioethics to immigration and integration policies. Her criticism towards the Slovenian right wing gradually brought Hribar closer to the Slovenian left wing, including then- President of Slovenia Milan Kučan and the third way reformist circles within the United List of Social Democrats. She frequently, however, took a more nationalist stand regarding foreign policy, especially the border disputes with neighbouring Croatia. Polemics with Janez Janša In the 1990s, Spomenka Hribar emerged as one of the strongest critics of the politician Janez Janša, one of the leaders of the Slovenian right wing. The two had been close allies until 1992. In 1992, Spomenka Hribar and her husband Tine Hribar even offered Janša to take the leadership of the liberal wing of the Slovenian Democratic UnionTine Hribar, Slovenci kot nacija: soočanja s sodobniki (Ljubljana: Enotnost, 1995). However, both later accused Janša of populism and condemned his conciliatory attitude towards the conservative sections of Slovenian Catholicism. Spomenka Hribar turned against Janša in 1996, denouncing his \\"right wing turn\\" and accusing him of a sectarian and paranoiac conception of politics. She later intensified her criticism, accusing him of authoritarianism and demagoguery. Differently from her husband Tine Hribar, who became more conciliatory towards Janša after 2004, seeing him as an essentially positive figure in Slovenian conservativism and implicitly supporting him in the 2004 elections, She maintained her position against the conservative politician. In 2007, she accused him of corruption and anti-democratic attitudes. Janša has accused Hribar of fostering personal animosity against his person, and stimulating a climate of culture wars in Slovenia. In Janša's view, Hribar has always had a deep disinterest in economic policies; she has failed to analyse the true power and economic relations in Slovenian society by obscuring them with both ideological mystifications and personal obsessions, thus helping the liberal economic and political establishment that has hegemonized the Slovenian public sphere since the 1990s. Spomenka's husband, Tine, who shared her political views throughout the 1990s, has maintained a substantially positive opinion of Janša since 2004. In 2009, the youth wing of the New Slovenia party claimed Spomenka had collaborated with the Yugoslav Secret Police (UDBA) based on a number with her name in leaked files. However, the file number is among the range associated with people that were monitored by the secret police, rather than those that collaborated with them.

This method can apply to both extant and extinct animals, according to the scope of the study. Mesowear is based on studying an animal's tooth wearing fingerprint. In brief, each animal has special feeding habits, which cause unique tooth wearing. Rough feeds cause serious tooth abrasion, while smooth one triggers moderate abrasion, so browsers have teeth with moderate abrasion and grazers have teeth with rough abrasion. Scoring systems can quantify tooth abrasion observations and ease comparisons between individuals.  Mesowear definition The mesowear method or tooth wear scoring method Clauss, M; Franz-Odendaal, T A; Brasch, J; Castell, J C; Kaiser, T (2007). Tooth wear in captive giraffes (Giraffa camelopardalis): mesowear analysis classifies free- ranging specimens as browsers but captive ones as grazers. Journal of Zoo and Wildlife Medicine, 38(3):433-445. is a quick and inexpensive process of determining the lifelong diet of a taxon (grazer or browser) and was first introduced in the year 2000. The mesowear technique can be extended to extinct and also extant animals. Mesowear analyses require large sample populations (>20), which can be problematic for some localities, but the method yields an accurate depiction of an animal's average lifelong diet.Hoffman, J. M. 2006. \\"Using stable carbon isotope, microwear and mesowear analysis to determine paleodiets of neogene ungulates and the presence of c4 or c3 grasses in northern and central florida\\" Mesowear analysis is based on the physical properties of ungulate foods as reflected in the relative amounts of attritive and abrasive wear that they cause on the dental enamel of the occlusal surfaces. Mesowear was recorded by examining the buccal apices of molar tooth cusps. Apices were characterized as sharp, rounded, or blunt, and the valleys between them either high or low. The method has been developed only for selenodont and trilophodont molars, but the principle is readily extendable to other crown types.In collecting the data the teeth are inspected at close range, a hand lens will be used. Mesowear analysis is insensitive to wear stage as long as the very early and very late stages are excluded.Fortelius, M., N. Solounias. 2000. \\"Functional Characterization of Ungulate Molars Using the Abrasion-Attrition Wear Gradient: A New Method for Reconstructing Paleodiets\\" Mesowear analysis follows standard protocols.

It was created by volunteer Google engineers in response to the 2010 Haiti earthquake. Google Person Finder is written in Python and hosted on Google App Engine. Its database and API are based on the People Finder Interchange Format (PFIF) developed in 2005 for the Katrina PeopleFinder Project. History Immediately after the 2010 Haiti earthquake a group of 20 volunteer engineers developed Person Finder. The software was based on Ka-Ping Yee's work on the September 11 survivor registry and on the PFIF data standard. Google also worked with the United States Department of State to create an embeddable version, which was embedded on the State Department's website and other websites. Google Person Finder launched in English, French, and Haitian Creole on January 15, less than three days after the earthquake. As with previous response efforts to the September 11 attacks and Hurricane Katrina, many different organizations created sites with lists of missing persons, leading to a concern that information would be scattered across incompatible information silos. Using PFIF, Google Person Finder aggregated the data from many of these sites, including registries run by CNN, the Miami Herald, and The New York Times. Google's work on the Haiti earthquake led to the formation of the Google Crisis Response team, which has launched Google Person Finder again for several subsequent disasters, in many different languages and with a variety of data exchange partners. Deployment Google Person Finder is typically embedded in a multilingual Crisis Response page on Google's site, which also contains various other disaster tools such as satellite photographs, shelter locations, road conditions, and power outage information. For the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, Google also set up a Picasa account to allow people to submit photos of the name lists posted in emergency shelters, to be manually transcribed and entered into Google Person Finder. Noteworthy deployments of Google Person Finder include: *January 2010: 2010 Haiti earthquake (complete within 72 hours) *February 2010: 2010 Chile earthquake (live within one day) *July 2010: 2010 Pakistan floods (considered a failure because people in the affected area did not have Internet access) *February 2011: February 2011 Christchurch earthquake (live within 3 hours) *March 2011: 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami (live within 1 hour) *October 2011: 2011 Van earthquake (live within 1 hour) *April 2013: 2013 Boston Marathon bombing *April 2013: 2013 Ya'an earthquake (live within one day) *October 2013: 2013 Cyclone Phailin *November 2013: Typhoon Haiyan (Yolanda) *April 2015: April 2015 Nepal earthquake. The system was tracking 202,400 names as of March 15, 2011 and more than 600,000 as of April 4, 2011. Details Sites that adopt PFIF may interconnect with each other by exporting and transmitting data or allowing their site to be scraped; sites such as blogs and narrative accounts that are not compatible are reviewed by volunteers who key missing person information in PFIF format. The software widget used for directly entering information has two buttons, \\"I'm looking for someone\\" and \\"I have information about someone\\", and can be embedded directly onto other web pages.

Nicodemus khaniri died of a Heart attack in 1994 as he was opening the new residence of a constituent, Dr. Tom Mulusa. Agriculture Hamisi District is a hilly terrain straddling the Equator, from east to west. The majority of the inhabitants are poor peasant farmers who eke out a living from a harsh, rocky land. Although this region has adequate annual rainfall, the inhabitants lack skills and tools to harvest the rainwater. Thus, water shortage is a perennial problem here. The main cash crop is tea, which is grown at higher altitudes in the region. Other crops are maize, millet, bananas, avocado, papaya, sweet potatoes and cassava. The inhabitants also rear cattle, goats, sheep and chickens. This District is rated as one of the poorest in the country due to the high population growth and alcoholism amongst the youth. Religion Hamisi is headquarters to four main Christian Churches; the Pentecostal Assemblies of God (PAG) at Nyang'ori, Friends' Church (Quackers) at Kaimosi,the African Divine Church at Boyani near Gamalenga and Israel (Nineve) Church at Jebrok. The prevalence of religious activities has not reduced undesirable delinquencies in this region. Literacy rates are above Kenyan Rural average; but a serious lack of educational tools to push this resource to the next level is the main challenge. Demographics Kaimosi, one of the notable towns in Hamisi, has been a major attraction to international visitors who come as students, Peace Corps volunteers, and missionaries. Some of the major schools in Hamisi are Kaimosi High Schools for boys and girls, Kaimosi Teachers College, Friends College Kaimosi, Kaimosi Special School, and Kaimosi Friends Primary School. Another attraction is the \\"Hill of Vision\\" or Javujiluachi in local dialect,Tiriki. The Tiriki community, majority of the people who inhabit Hamisi District are cultural diehards who practice traditional circumcision rites of passage into manhood, where initiates spend a month in the bush being taught Tiriki community values. Youth unemployment is rampant although many young people have resorted to motorcycle transport for income generation. HIV-AIDS is one of the leading causes of death in Hamisi District. The spread of HIV-AIDS has been attributed to the presence of institutions in the Kaimosi Complex and Market Centers such as Cheptulu, Serem, and Shamakhokho.

He was a Nubian king, who was one of the 25th Egyptian Dynasty (about 747–656 BC) rulers of the Kingdom of Kush. It is now in the British Museum in London. While the Sphinx of Taharqo is significantly smaller (73 centimeters long) than the Great Sphinx of Giza (73 meters long), it is notable for its prominent Egyptian and Kushite elements. The lion portrayed in the sphinx is done in classic Egyptian style, while the face of the Sphinx is clearly that of Taharqo. The hieroglyphs on the statue explain that it is a portrait of the great King Taharqo, the fourth pharaoh to rule over the combined kingdoms of Kush and Ancient Egypt during the Third Intermediate Period. The sphinx is made of sandy grey granite.  Taharqo  Taharqo was the last Nubian king who ruled over Egypt. He was defeated by the Assyrian kings Esarhaddon and Aššurbanipal. His reign lasted from 690 when he succeeded Shebitqo to his death in 664. He was the son of Piye and Abar and the father to his daughter, Amenirdis II. Taharqo was one of the rulers of Kush who dominated Egypt as the Twenty-fifth Dynasty. He was a significantly important ruler, initiating a golden age for his new kingdom. Although Taharqo was not of Egyptian descent, he worshipped the Egyptian god Amun, built pyramids and temples in the Egyptian model, and had his officials write in Egyptian hieroglyphics. The statue Pharaoh Taharqa of the Twenty-fifth Dynasty of Egypt depicted as a sphinx, now exhibited at the British Museum. Taharqa was a recurring enemy of Esarhaddon, defeating his planned invasion of Egypt in 673 BC and in turn being defeated by Esarhaddon in 671 BC. The statue is a sphinx, representing here the immense power of the Egyptian and Kushite pharaoh Taharqo, whose face is shown. The headdress bears two uraei, the Nubian symbol of kingship, and Taharqo's name appears in a cartouche on the sphinx's chest. The statue is called \\"a masterpiece of Kushite art.\\" The statue was excavated at Temple T, in the area east of the south-eastern part of the Temple of Amun at Kawa (now Gematon), in Nubia (now Sudan), during excavations there by the Archaeological Mission of the University of Oxford during the 1930s. Construction of the stone temple was started in 683 BC by Taharqo. The statue is a British Museum \\"Highlight\\" object and was selected as the twenty-second object in the series A History of the World in 100 Objects selected by British Museum director Neil MacGregor and broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in 2010. The sphinx is an image of a black pharaoh from sub-Saharan Africa, and its message was to point out that this black pharaoh stood in a long line of great Egyptian rulers.

It is now a writer's house museum. Building The White Dacha was built in 1898 following Chekhov's success with The Seagull. He took up residence there after his father's death and to aid him with coping with tuberculosis. Chekhov planted a variety of trees including mulberry, cherry, almond, peach, cypress, citrus, acacia and birch. He also planted roses such as 'Cheshunt Hybrid', 'Cramoisi Supérieur', 'Gloire de Dijon', 'La France', 'Madame Joseph Schwartz', 'Madame Lombard', 'Princesse de Sagan', Rosa banksiae f. 'Lutea', 'Souvenir de la Malmaison', 'Turner's Crimson Rambler'Roses Crimea..., and kept dogs and tame cranes. The house was designed by L.N. Shapovalov. Aleksandr Kuprin described the house as follows, > It was, perhaps, the most original building in Yalta. It is all white, pure, > easy, beautifully asymmetrical, ... with a tower, and unexpected ledges, > with a glass veranda below and an open terrace above, with scattered broad > and narrow windows... \\". V.N. Ladygensky mentioned that \\"a dacha in Crimea, in Аutka, near Yalta, was validly constructed, excellent\\".

Museum Chekhov in the study at the White Dacha After Chekhov's death (1904) the house was looked after by his sister, Masha, until 1921 when it became a museum. During the Nazi occupation Maria Pavlovna refused to leave and put up pictures of Hauptmann (the German dramatist) any \\"a...dramatist\\" on the wall and refused to let a German officer move into her brother's rooms. Nothing went missing but the house was damaged by one of the last air raids on the area by the Luftwaffe.  Museum funding issues  The Soviet government, as with other such heritage sites, diligently looked after the house but following the breakup of the USSR, the responsibility for the house's upkeep came under dispute. Crimea became an autonomous republic within Ukraine. The museum falls under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Culture of the Crimean Autonomous Republic and their budget is extremely small.

RFGI acts as a consultant to help implement government reforms. The Foundation researches the key issues, for legal reform, in law and governance. It also sponsors public events to raise awareness, particularly among youth who are often distanced from the democratic process. The Research Foundation for Governance has a broad perspective on \\"governance\\". RFGI adopts a definition that based upon the one given by the European Commission: : \\"rules, processes and behaviour that affect the way in which powers are exercised…. particularly as regards openness, participation, accountability, effectiveness and coherence\\"\\"European Governance: A White Paper\\" – COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 2001, Brussels European Governance: A White Paper Pdf The Foundation is a non- partisan, neutral and independent organisation which neither supports nor endorses any extreme political ideology or specific candidate/party.  Introduction  Started in January 2009, the Research Foundation for Governance in India (RFGI) is an Ahmedabad-based think tank. RFGI is a one-of- its-kind think tank in the area of law and governance, with the idea of the citizenry, and particularly the youth, to be more aware and participative to the legal processes in the country. The objective of the Foundation is to help create strong processes of governance and an awareness of citizenry, primarily through seeking reforms in the legal and political arena by involving youth from different spheres. RFGI aims to pursue this objective through spreading awareness of laws pertaining to governance, as well as by conducting research on key legal issues which affects governance of the country. RFGI has a growing member-base of 600 members. This total includes eminent academicians, industrialists, lawyers, media professionals, policy-makers, politicians and students. The organisation has the potential to grow in the future, given the needs of political and legal reforms in the country.  Focus areas and activities  The activities of RFGI are mainly structured around three focus areas, titled: Awareness, Research, and Consultation. ; Awareness initiatives One of the primary objectives of the foundation is to spread awareness on issues pertaining to governance and law amongst the citizens of India. The Foundation seeks to make people think about politics in a more positive way through making presentations and interactive sessions in schools and colleges, organising discussions and debates, and by getting more and more people interested in the process of governance. The following are some of the awareness initiatives carried out by RFGI: * Partnered with Jaago Re! One Billion Votes to promote voter registration for the 2009 Lok Sabha elections * Conducted a six-week project on local governance with Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation and Indicorps * Conducting presentations on citizenship and democracy at local schools and colleges in Ahmedabad ; Research activities The research activities at the Foundation include examining and undertaking research on issues concerning politics, law, governance, infrastructure, functioning of public institution, welfare related issues, including those pertaining to elections as part of the function. The Foundation, through its research activities recommends and advocates systems of good governance at different levels of the society. Some of RFGI's publications are the following: * “Acquisition of Land for 'Development' projects in India: The need for serious reconsideration of existing law\\" – Kelly Dhru, 2008\\"Acquisition of Land for 'Development' projects in India: The need for serious reconsideration of existing law\\" – Kelly Dhru, 2008 Land Acquisition Pdf * “Whether the graduates of the National Law Schools cater to the need of Bar/Bench?” – Rohit Moonka\\"Whether the graduates of the National Law Schools cater to the need of Bar/Bench?” – Rohit Moonka National Law School Pdf * “Freedom within the Law – The Search for Adivasi Autonomy\\" – Curtis Riep, 2009\\"Freedom within the Law – The Search for Adivasi Autonomy\\" – Curtis Riep, 2009 Freedom within the Law Pdf ; RFGI impact As part of the first phase of this project, RFGI had organised a panel discussion on the issue, on 5 July 2009, at GLS Auditorium, Gujarat. The event was graced by the Chief Justice of Gujarat, Justice Radhakrishnan as well as Dr. Madhava Menon, Founder Director, National Law School Bangalore and National Judicial Academy, Bhopal. The seminar was a major success and was able to generate debate and discussion on key issues pertaining to legal reforms. Two of the recommendations which stemmed from the seminar are already in the stage of implementation: * RFGI has been invited by the Gujarat Bar Association as Advisors on their 'Education & Training' Committee and work has already begun on structuring courses for training of the young lawyers in Gujarat. * Shri Veerappa Moily, Union Law Minister, recently announced scholarships for young lawyersScholarships for Lawyers ; Consultation The Foundation gets directly involved with Government projects and initiatives through its consultancy work. This involves working closely with different Government departments and organisations. One recent consultancy project was that on Library Development in the city of Ahmedabad for the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation. RFGI's recommendations are now being implemented by the relevant Government authority.

More detailed information on projects  1) Project on Understanding and Removing Entry Barriers to the Profession of Litigation Research Foundation for Governance: in India aims at motivating bright youth into the processes of governance. These include fields such as politics, administration, judiciary etc. Given the pivotal role of the judiciary in India, it becomes essential that the best of the minds in the country are employed in this direction. Unfortunately, the common perception of the profession of litigation and of judges is that of an inefficient, corrupt system full of delays and malpractices. For example, the legal system faces an incredible backlog with the UNDP estimating that there are over 20 million cases pending, a problem which could be reduced by increasing the number of litigators and judges so as to make the system more efficient. The Indian legal system also faces vast corruption issues, with over 26.30 billion estimated paid in bribes to the legal system in 2006. (www.undp.org.in) The perception can be changed through employing bright and efficient youth committed to the profession and subsequently, by bringing about awareness about the changing face of legal system in the eyes of a common man. The aim in this study is to ensure that the profession of litigation is conducive, welcoming and open to bright young law students from the country. According to the Law Commission of India, the country needs 2,724 additional judges so as to resolve the pending cases in the next 5 years. (www.lawcommissionofindia.nic.in) At the same time, it is desirable that the students from five-year as well as three-year colleges are adequately trained to best contribute to the profession and are ultimately working towards an efficient justice-delivery mechanism which will help the society and give back the due respect that the profession deserves. As part of the Phase-2 of the project, work has begun to increase the survey strength to 1000 respondents. In parallel, work to develop a white paper containing concrete recommendations on reconsidering entry level requirements and working conditions for young law graduates in litigation is being undertaken. The white paper would also profile case-studies of some of the individuals who have established themselves as arguing lawyers against all odds. After the completion of the white-paper, the recommendations will be taken through a volley of round-table discussions with prominent people and opinion makers and finally culminate with publication of the same. RFGI thereafter aims to create awareness and lobby for the implementation of the recommendations to the relevant government departments as well as other stakeholders. RFGI hopes that by implementing recommendations that help attract bright youngsters to the profession of litigation, many of the issues facing the Indian legal system will improve. 2) Project on Analysing Inner-party Democracy in Political Parties in India This study aims at providing a link between a common Indian citizen and the main political parties. The basic objective is to raise awareness amongst citizens on how political parties function in terms of the democratic processes followed for its administrative and functional aspects. The research would also look at the way parties outline a career growth for a party member in terms of opportunity and accessibility, while looking at the broader question of the attractiveness of 'politics' as a career. The message would be encapsulated in the premise of moving towards a more democratic and reformist model of political party functioning wherein party members get a bigger say in the functioning and decision making stages, making the party machinery reflect a complete inclusive system of all those involved. In the future, the aim is to create an evolved system with citizens having more faith in political parties, primarily derived from RFGI's proposed new model of meritocracy and fairness in all aspects, be it office bearers, ticket distribution etc. A White Paper would be published on this research idea, taking it through a volley of round table discussions with prominent people and opinion makers and finally culminate with a grand seminar to raise awareness on this issue. RFGI thereafter aims to create new benchmarks and present the recommendations to relevant stakeholders as well as to people of the nation. 3) Study on \\"Preventive Law: lessons to be learnt from preventive medicine\\" under the guidance from Professor Dileep Mavalankar, Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad and Columbia School of Public Policy Significant research and developments have been made in the field of preventive andsocial medicines, which have alleviated human suffering to a great extent. By spreading awareness about health and hygiene, vaccinations, spraying of medicines and other such measures, certain diseases have been reduced, and have been 'nipped in the bud'. Like medicine, the role of the legal system of a country is also to alleviate human suffering. So far, the Indian legal system has concentrated on 'Remedial Measures', rather than adopt a preventive approach. The existing courts in India are flooded with cases. The number of pending cases in the courts of Gujarat is . At the same time, the citizens are less aware about their legal rights, and fear the system. The objective of this paper is to draw a parallel between two disciplines which have similar objectives. The hypothesis is to test whether similar paths can be followed and lessons be learnt by the Indian legal system from the Preventive and Social Medicine. The paper focuses on the Human Resource issues pertaining to Law and Medicine, particularly, on the entry requirements, professional qualifications, ethics and the population to provider ratios. The possibilities of customisation of legal assistance provided in different areas are explored. This paper also reviews certain legislations which can be better implemented and the disputes under which can be prevented by following certain key features of preventive medicine. After the completion of the white-paper, the observations would be taken through round table discussions and disseminate the suggestions through publication and distribution of the paper. The suggestions would thereafter be presented to relevant government departments as well as other stakeholders and lobby for their implementation. 4) Study on \\"Efficiency and Accountability of Lok-Adalats in Gujarat” in partnership with Accountability Initiative, Centre for Policy Research, New Delhi Lok Adalat is an alternative form of dispute settlement mechanism, introduced in India in the early 80s. The main idea behind having them was to improve access to justice at local levels, and ease the burden on the regular courts due to millions of petty cases that clog up their scare resources, awaiting settlement. Lok Adalats provide a speedy, fair and deliberative form of dispute settlement, drawing on traditional methods of conciliation where the presiding judge – who is an experienced adjudicator with legal acumen and a record of public service – brings about an understanding between the claimants, and settles the cases as compromise between the two sides. Due to a variety of reasons – ranging from misinformation and lack of awareness among people as to what the Lok Adalat was for, lack of knowledge and capacity on the part of the Lok Adalat benches to deal with the cases properly, and even intimidation of complainants against approaching Lok Adalats with their grievances, Lok Adalats often have limited results. Arguably, many of these problems in implementation could be addressed with some attention to detail, and a commitment to results on the part of the authorities. In theory Lok Adalats still remain a possible option to serve as a platform for solving cases at the pre-litigation stage. Given this context, the research project aims to explore the efficacy and efficiency of Lok Adalats and test their accountability to the common Indian citizen. 5) Awareness seminars on Law & Governance in schools & colleges One of the primary objectives of the foundation is to spread awareness on issues pertaining to governance and law amongst the citizens of India. The Foundation seeks to make people think about politics in a more positive way through making presentations in schools and colleges, organising discussions and debates, and by getting more and more people interested in the process of governance.

Life He was the younger son of the ejected minister John Jennings (1634–1701), whose ministry to the independent congregation at Kibworth was continued by his elder brother John. David passed through the Kibworth grammar school, and studied for the ministry (1709–14) at the Fund Academy in Moorfields, under Isaac Chauncy and his successors, Thomas Ridgley, D.D., and John Eames. His first sermon was at Battersea, 23 May 1714. In March 1715 he was chosen evening lecturer at Rotherhithe; in June 1716 he became assistant to John Foxon at Girdlers' Hall, Basinghall Street; on 19 May 1718 he was called to succeed Thomas Simmons as pastor of the independent congregation, Wapping New Stairs. Here he was ordained on 25 July 1718, and in this charge he remained till his death. At the Salters' Hall debates of 1719 he sided with the non-subscribers, though a Calvinist. In 1733 he was selected by William Coward as one of the lecturers in Bury Street, St. Mary Axe; he became one of the Coward trustees in May 1743, and in August 1743 one of the Coward lecturers at Little St. Helen's. Jennings's career as a divinity tutor began in 1744, on the death of Eames, whose successor he became under the Coward trust, the \\"congregational\\" fund at this point transferring its support to another academy. The presbyterian board sent him no students till 1758. Jennings extended the course of study from four years to five, and abandoned the boarding school model. The lectures were given in Wellclose Square, at the residence of Samuel Morton Savage, the tutor in classics and philosophy. Unlike his brother John, Jennings did not attempt lectures on an independent plan. The divinity textbook on which he lectured was the ‘Medulla Theologiæ’ of the Dutch divine, Van Marck. His lecture notes on the Moses and Aaron of Thomas Godwyn became the posthumous work on Jewish Antiquities, by which Jennings is best known. A strict disciplinarian, he was suspicious of any heterodoxy. Two of his students, Thomas and John Wright, afterwards presbyterian ministers in Bristol, were expelled on grounds of doctrine; in fact the majority of his pupils became Arians, according to Alexander Gordon writing in the Dictionary of National Biography. Philip Furneaux, his editor, Joshua Toulmin, his biographer, and Abraham Rees, the encyclopedist, were among his students; Thomas Cogan and Thomas Jervis were under him for short periods. He encouraged the study of physical science, enjoyed astronomy, and had in practical mechanics as a hobby; he was also musical. In May 1749 the university of St. Andrews, at Philip Doddridge's suggestion, sent him its diploma of D.D. He enjoyed good health till the last two years of his life, and died on Thursday, 16 September 1762. Works Jennings published several sermons, including an ordination sermon for John Jennings (1742) and funeral sermons for Daniel Neal (1743), Isaac Watts (1749), and Timothy Jollie (1757); also * ‘The Beauty and Benefit of Early Piety,’ &c.;, 1730. * ‘A Vindication of the Scripture Doctrine of Original Sin,’ &c.;, 1740, anonymous, against John Taylor of Norwich. * ‘An Introduction to the Use of the Globes,’ &c.;, 1747; an appendix deals with some astronomical difficulties in the Book of Genesis. * ‘The Scripture Testimony … an Appeal to Reason … for the Truth of the Holy Scriptures,’ &c.;, 1755,; several times reprinted; 1815, 12mo, with preface by B.

His Bury Street lectures were published in 1735; he translated a tract of A. H. Francke on preaching, 1736, and issued an abridgment of Cotton Mather's life, 1744. Family His eldest son, Joseph, married a daughter of Daniel Neal, by Elizabeth, sister of Nathaniel Lardner. Joseph Jennings's son David (died 6 December 1819) was the author of Hawkhurst, a Sketch of its History, &c.;, 1792; he had erected in 1789 a monument to Lardner, his great-uncle, in Hawkhurst Church, Kent.

This mine is considered to be the world's oldest. The haematite ore deposit was used in the Middle Stone Age to extract red ochre, while in later times the deposit was mined for iron smelting and iron ore export. Etymology Ngwenya means \\"crocodile\\" in Swazi.Ngwenya Mine & Lion Cavern, Thekingdomofeswatini.com (accessed 13 May 2019) This name comes from the fact that the mountains containing the mine was crocodile-shaped, before heavy-mining began in the 1960s and defaced this ancestral shape.The 43,000 Year Old Iron Ore Mine in Ngwenya, Bigbeaverdiaries.com, 15 April 2016 (accessed 13 May 2019) Background=Phase 1 Several stone age artefacts have been found in the mine during archaeological works in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Their age was established with radiocarbon dating as older than 20,000 years. Later, radiocarbon dating yielded the age of the oldest mining activities as 41,000 to 43,000 years. This would make Ngwenya the oldest known mine. The site was known to Early Man for its deposits of red and specular haematite, used in cosmetics and rituals. Phase 2 Red ochre from here was extracted by the ancestors of the San and used in rock paintings, which are common in Eswatini. By about 400 AD, pastoralist Bantu tribes had arrived from the north. They were familiar with the smelting of iron ore, and traded their iron widely throughout the African continent. Phase 3 The haematite iron ore with the iron content of up to 60% was prospected in the middle of the 19th century. The Swaziland Iron Ore Development Company (SIODC), owned by the Anglo-American Corporation, started mining of the deposit in 1964. A ten-year contract with a Japanese company made it the largest consumer of the iron ore. The open pit mining took place between 1964 and 1977, temporarily boosting the economic development of the area by establishing the Goba railway line connecting the mine with the Mozambique Railway System, and an electricity supply network (Matsapha industrial Site). An estimated 20,000,000 tonnes of iron ore have been extracted from the mine. However, an estimated 32 million tons of ore remained in the soil. Supposedly the Anglo-American Corporation stopped prospecting the mine because it got flooded.Nellie Bowles, Swaziland's Ngwenya mine extracts its ore and exacts its price, Mg.co.za, 31 August 2012 (accessed 13 May 2019) There was a plan to revive extraction activities in the mine, but the price of iron ore fell, making the project hardly profitable. The land was eventually donated to the Swaziland National Trust Commission for management.This mine in Swaziland that produced iron 43,000 years ago is the world’s oldest, Face2faceafrica.com, 27 May 2018 (accessed 13 May 2019) The mine's visitor center opened in 2005. The building was donated by the Republic of China on Taiwan, and some ancient tools displayed in the center were recovered with the help of the European Union.Samkelisiwe Khosa, Ngwenya mine history burns To Ashes], Swazi Observer, 25 September 2018 (accessed 13 May 2019) (accessed on pressreader.com) In 2008, as the Swazi government was considering reopening the mine to extraction activities, the Swaziland National Trust Commission submitted the site to the UNESCO's list of World Heritage Sites to protect it, but the submission was not accepted.Ngwenya Mines, Unesco.org, 31 December 2008 (accessed 13 May 2019) The inactive ancient mine is called the Lion Cavern. The modern-operations mine nearby is now flooded. Phase 4 The Indian group Salgaocar operated the modern-day mine from 2011 to 2014 through the Salgaocar Swaziland limited Company. Before allocating the mine to Salgaocar, the king Mswati III dismissed the National Trust Commission's request to protect the area from new mining activities, and replaced the entire board of the Commission to permanently stop those demands.Andrea Durbach, Lucas Lixinski, Heritage, Culture and Rights: Challenging Legal Discourses, Bloomsbury Publishing, 18 May 2017 (accessed 13 May 2019) Those operations lead to a heavy pollution of the water sources that feed the city of Mbabane. Among many environmental issues, the mining operations are a threat to the Disa intermedia, a protected orchid growing exclusively in the region. Cases of corruption to get the mining licence were reported, including a $28 million donation to the king by Salgaocar. The deal established a 25% ownership of the mine for the king, 25% for the government, and 50% to Salgaocar. Reports also claimed that Salgaocar was using Mozambican and South African trucks to avoid paying import taxes. 2,500 jobs were announced after the Salgaocar-Swazi deals, but the positions were never created. Salgaocar ceased its mining activities in Ngwenya in 2014. In January 2018, the Mineral Management Board announced it was ready to relaunch prospecting activities at the Ngwenya mine.Ngwenya iron ore mine to reopen, Steelguru.com, 23 January 2018 (accessed 13 May 2019) In September 2018, the visitor center burnt to ashes. The National Trust Commission declared that all the ancient artifacts in the center were lost in the fire. The officers on site did not react when the fire started to spread.

Lyricist Raghvendra Singh is the creative director in this serial. The Show Reruns Again on India's No. 1 Channel Dangal Plot Do Hanson Ka Joda is the story of Preeti, a young dreamy girl who wants to marry a Bollywood \\"Prince Charming\\". However, in a turn of events, she marries Suryakamal, an ordinary middle class man. Her bubbly cousin Sumi, on the other hand, marries a hunk Rishi. Both the girls find their marriage to be not what it seems as Preeti realises what a loving husband Suryakamal is, while Sumi is regularly assaulted by her violent husband Rishi. After Preeti and Suryakamal pay a visit to his aunt and begin their romantic journey together, both the girls have to urgently return to their maternal house as Preeti's father leaves the family due to Chachi Ji's cunning plans. Radhika urges Veenu to see Chachi Ji's reality, but in turn is insulted and has to leave herself. As Preeti's mother passes away, Suryakamal promises her he will unite the family. Meanwhile, Suryakamal's sister Sajni had an earlier pending operation, which now succeeds. Preeti and Suryakamal soon find out about Rishi and get him arrested. Sumi now begins to live with them. Preeti finds an opportunity to enter into a dance competition with Pushkar, and after much reluctance, Suryakamal ends up dancing with her in the finale and they win the competition. Sajni is about to marry Pushkar, when Preeti and Suryakamal find his violent truth out and stop the marriage. Further, the plot develops into Suryakamal's selfish family where a property dispute emerges as Preeti's brother-in-law Neeraj is charged by Ritu for domestic violence. He reveals that the property in fact belongs to Preeti, due to which they - mainly Ammaji, and Ritu - plot against Preeti. Suryakamal finds this out, but they murder him and hide his body so no one can know the truth. Preeti is devastated on his disappearance and tortured by her in-laws, but soon runs into a con man who is a lookalike of Suryakamal - Chandar. He is mistaken for Suryakamal, and later finds out his lookalike's truth, revealing that Suryakamal has in fact died. Ritu and Ammaji discover this and frames Chandar for Suryakamal's murder, but it is proved otherwise. During the investigation, Preeti's dead body is found as part of a conspiracy to get her property, but fail as their plans are foiled and the truth is unveiled. The end shows Preeti and Suryakamal's ashes being submerged together. Cast * Shubhangi Atre as Preeti: She is a 22-year-old girl who lives in the world of dreams. She dreams that one day her knight in shining armor will lift her up in his arms and take her away with him to the land of dreams. She adores films especially the soft romance types. Preeti has not yet realized the harsh realities of life and for her everything is like what it is in films. This soft-spoken-bubbly lass is not only the apple of her parents eyes but is loved by all.

Biography  A pagan, Rufinus was the brother of Neratius Cerealis, Galla (the mother of Constantius Gallus), and the mother of Maximus. He was pontifex maximus, consularis for Numidia, comes ordinis primi intra consistorium under the Emperor Constans I or his brother Constantius II, comes per Orientem, Aegypti et Mesopotamiae per easdem vice sacra iudicans from 5 April 342, praetorian prefect of Italy from 344 to 347 (between the prefectures of Fulvius Placidus and Ulpius Limenius), consul ordinarius prior in 347 with Flavius Eusebius, praetorian prefect of Illyricum between 347 and 352. While he was prefect, he was sent as an envoy by the usurper Magnentius, who had ousted Constans, to Constantius II, along with Marcellinus, Maximus and Nunechius. Rufinus was not arrested, unlike his companions, and kept the prefecture of Illyricum under Constantius. In 354, after the fall of Magnentius, he was praetorian prefect of Gaul, living in the capital Trier, but was replaced by Gaius Ceionius Rufius Volusianus Lampadius, perhaps because Rufinus was a relative of Constantius Gallus, when Gallus fell into disgrace with the Emperor. Between 365 and 368 he was the praetorian prefect for Italy and Africa, succeeding Claudius Mamertinus and of Gaul from 366–368. He died in service.

Jaime Martinez-Tolentino at Home in Ocala, Florida Early life and education  At the age of four, Martinez Tolentino contracted polio, which has left him crippled. page 2 In 1951, he and his family emigrated to New York City where he lived until 1966. He attended New York University where he majored in French and French literature, while also studying Spanish literature and German. As an undergraduate he participated actively in the theater.  Academic career  After earning a B.A. and an M.A in French literature, he returned, briefly, to his native Puerto Rico where he was named French professor at The University of Puerto Rico. Then he left for Europe to pursue further studies. In France, he studied French at the Sorbonne, and then he relocated to Spain, where he studied both French and Hispanic Literature. He received a PhD in French Literature from the Complutense University of Madrid, and then he returned to Puerto Rico. Between 1970 and 1984, Martinez Tolentino taught French at the Mayaguez Campus of the University of Puerto Rico, and he also published three books on French. Also during this period, he published a full-length play, and in 1984, he directed its staged version. One of his short stories was adapted for the stage in Puerto Rico in 1979.  Writing career  It was also during this period that he joined the group of young Puerto Rican writers connected to the literary magazine Mester: the novelist Carmelo Rodríguez Torres, the narrator Wilfredo Ruiz Oliveras, and the poets Luis Cartañá and Sotero Rivera Avilés. Under their influence, Martinez Tolentino began publishing short stories in journals and newspapers, and in 1975, he edited an anthology of their short stories. In 1980, he published his play La imagen del otro, and three years later, an original collection of short stories of the fantastic. As he continued publishing in Spanish, his interest in Hispanic literature grew. He began taking graduate courses in Spanish and Puerto Rican literature, and then taught Spanish literature at the Inter-American University of Puerto Rico, while still also teaching French at the UPR. In 1984, Martinez Tolentino resigned from his position as a French professor. He attended Purdue University in Indiana, where he acquired fluency in Portuguese, and then he transferred to the University of Massachusetts Amherst, where he received a second M.A. and a second PhD in Spanish and Latin American literature. In 1990, he became a Spanish professor at the State University of New York's College at Buffalo, where he continued writing and producing plays. He retired from teaching in 2002, but not from writing and publishing.  Publications = Fiction – books  * Cuentos modernos (Antología).

He is currently chairman of the European Division of Groupe Aeroplan, which owns and runs the Nectar Loyalty Programme in the UK. He also serves as non-executive chairman of Virgin Active, non-executive director of Whitbread plc, operating partner at Advent International and chairman of DFS. Career After graduating from Downing College, Cambridge, Baker worked at Mars Confectionery for nearly 10 years, working his way up to sales and marketing director. He joined Asda Stores Ltd in 1995, where he worked for the following 9 years becoming Marketing Director in 1999, and ultimately chief operating officer in 2002, following their acquisition by Walmart. In September 2003, Baker joined Boots Group as chief executive officer. The company had been reporting losses following its ill-advised move into its 'Wellbeing' services, which included Dentistry, Massage and Botox. Despite implementing a number of cost-cutting measures and extending opening hours, the company continued to struggle until October 2005 it announced it was to merge with competitor Alliance Unichem. The announcement met with widespread opposition, but the merger was cleared by the OFT in February 2006 and completed in July that year. Baker became chief executive officer of the new Alliance Boots GmbH. In April 2007, after publishing annual results that showed a profit increase of 7.4%, Alliance Boots was sold to private equity firm KKR for £11.1 billion; the highest price ever paid by a private equity company for a British public company. Baker left the company on completion of the transaction. Baker has served as chairman of DFS since April 2010, following Advent International's £500 million takeover of the furniture retail chain. In June 2019, Baker launched his own private equity firm to invest in mid-market, consumer-facing businesses. The firm will target investments in the retail, leisure, services and health sectors in Britain and Europe. Current roles Baker now holds various board and advisory roles with top international companies including: * Chairman of the European Division of Groupe Aeroplan, which owns and runs the Nectar Loyalty Programme in the UK.

In 2008, Micronesia's votes on thirteen key issues identified as important to the United States by the State Department (including \\"resolutions relating to Cuba, the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, North Korea, Iran, Belarus, Burma and the Human Rights Council\\") matched the United States' position 90.9% of the time; only Israel and the Marshall Islands' rates were higher (100%).\\"Iran’s Security Council Bid Nears a Vote\\" , CNS News, October 14, 2008 In 2015, however, Micronesia voted to condemn the US embargo over Cuba.

It is headquartered in London and delivers all its services in Africa, mostly in Malawi. Pump Aid is a WASH (Water, Sanitation and Hygiene) NGO and is part of a worldwide programme committed to the delivery of the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals and the total eradication of water poverty by 2030. Pump Aid had offices in Malawi and London, and as of 2018 employed approximately 23 people, 70% of whom were based in Africa. Most of whom are national staff in Malawi trained in well-digging and water-pump installation.  History  Pump Aid was founded in 1998 by three teachers working in a rural primary school in Zimbabwe. Two of their pupils fell ill from contaminated water and died. These teachers realised the need for health superseded the need for education and so set up Pump Aid to provide wells in rural communities. The Zimbabwe government estimates that 10% of that country's rural water population now accesses water through pumps supplied by Pump Aid. In 2006, Pump Aid began working in Malawi where the bulk of its projects are now based. Malawi is the sixth poorest country in the world (by GDP per capita) and is ranked 170 (out of 188) on the UN Human Development Index. 85% of Malawi's population is engaged in and relies on rain-fed small-scale farming and only 11% of small-scale farmers have access to any form of irrigation. In recent years Pump Aid has moved away from simply installing pumps and now sees improved access to water as part of a broader context which includes, hygiene and sanitation, food and nutrition, access to education and economic independence. Pump Aid recognises that functionality is a key issue in assuring sustainability and delivering value for money and have adapted their community based approach to meet the functionality challenge.  Self-Supply  Pump Aid has been trialling a different approach to reducing water poverty called Self-supply, through which individuals are encouraged to invest in improvements to their own water supplies. Pilot Project Pump Aid received funding from UNICEF to pilot this approach in an agricultural district of Malawi called Kasungu and provided intensive support to a group of 25 local entrepreneurs, encouraging them to set up financially sustainable small businesses supplying a range of water products and services to three core markets: households, communities and small-scale farmers. The results of the pilot were astonishing and, in barely twelve months of trading, by digging wells, installing household pumps and repairing community pumps that had ceased to function, these 25 entrepreneurs delivered improved access to safe water to 21,614 people and had proved that, by the creation of a network of small businesses, pump functionality can be massively improved. Pump functionality in their delivery area increased from less than 55% to better than 95% and all this was delivered at a cost of around £12 per individual gaining access to water (including all start-up costs). This is less than half the cost of a traditional rural small community water point. This programme demonstrated a clear demand for households to own their own water points and for farmers to secure a reliable source of water for irrigation and, among the many accolades it received, it was awarded the International Aid and Development Award at the 2017 UK Charity Awards.  Early Childhood Development - CBCCs  Early in 2015 Pump Aid began working in rural pre-schools (known in Malawi as Community Based Childcare Centres - CBCCs), which are a key element of the government's Childhood Development Strategy. There are over 9,000 of these in Malawi, but fewer than 25% have access to safe water or basic sanitation facilities, exposing young children to life-threatening risks of water-borne diseases like diarrhoea.  Rural WASH  Pump Aid's improved access to rural WASH programme is based around its own unique take on a traditional rope and washer pump known as the Elephant Pump. Elephant Pump The Elephant Pump, based on a 3,000-year-old Chinese design, is a built using materials that can all be sourced locally and has very few moveable (and therefore breakable) parts. The name \\"Elephant Pump\\" refers to the pump's strength, shape, and reliability and the simplicity of its design means that, if it breaks (as pumps in Africa frequently do), 50% of breakages can be fixed within a day and 90% within four days. The Elephant Pump's design won the 1995 St Andrews Prize for the Environment for Pump Aid and, in 2006, the World Bank awarded Pump Aid a grant of US$120,000 funding 1,000 pumps and enabling the development of the Elephant Toilet. The Elephant Pump has now provided clean, safe water to over 1.35 million people living in rural areas of Zimbabwe Liberia and Malawi.  Urban Waste  In September 2015, Pump Aid began a Comic Relief match-funded programme in Blantyre, which sought to engage the local private sector in the provision of safe water, hygienic sanitation and waste recycling in the informal settlements that surround that city. In 2016 this programme expanded into Lilongwe. Pump Aid initiated this urban project after seeing a need for clean water in the informal settlements around Blantyre and Lilongwe, which are not served by local water boards. The programme supports local entrepreneurs to sell water filters and recycle waste in order to make a living. By integrating WASH with other sectors such as agriculture and business, Pump Aid is able to maximise its impact on a community.  Ambassador  International musician Corinne Bailey Rae has been a Goodwill Ambassador for Pump Aid since 2007. Corinne visited a Pump Aid project in Malawi in 2007. \\"I didn't realise just how amazing this organisation was until I went to Malawi in September,\\" she told The Guardian. \\"We were brought up thinking of Africa as this dry, 'cursed' continent, but there is water - you just have to go down deep enough to find it.” More recently she has represented Pump Aid by delivering their Radio 4 Appeal in January 2017. Lord Jack McConnell is also a keen ambassador for Pump Aid. He was elected an MSP in the first Scottish Parliament elections in 1999, becoming First Minister in 2001. In 2007, he was appointed an adviser to the Clinton Hunter Development Initiative in Malawi and Rwanda and in 2008 was appointed by Gordon Brown as the Prime Minister's Special Representative on Conflict Resolution Mechanisms. He became a member of the House of Lords in 2010 where he committed himself to continuing his work to tackle poverty in Africa and to developing the relationship between Scotland and Malawi.

It publishes the UK's biggest-selling regional daily newspaper the Express & Star and its sister title the Shropshire Star, as well as 16 weekly titles and the monthly Wolverhampton Magazine and Shropshire Magazine. The MNA has one of the fastest growing web networks in the regional press, with 1.3 million average monthly unique users to its sites expressandstar.com and shropshirestar.com – up 33.8 per cent year on year. iPad and iPhone apps for Express & Star and Shropshire Star were launched in January 2012, with further apps for Android and Kindle Fire scheduled for release in January 2013.

Scottish-American millionaire Andrew Carnegie founded the Express & Star in Wolverhampton in the 1880s along with a group of radical Liberal Party members, including Thomas Graham. Carnegie’s aim was to campaign, through a string of regional daily newspapers, for the creation of a British Republic. His dream was to sack the monarchy, scrap the House of Lords and destroy every vestige of privilege in the land. By 1902 Carnegie had abandoned his mission and the newspaper has been owned by the Graham family ever since. Early growth At least 28 newspapers have been published in Wolverhampton over the past century but the Express & Star remains the market leader. Among those to be seen off were the Evening News, which closed in July 1915. During the First World War, the Express & Star raised its price to a penny due to the price of paper, with a promise to revert to a halfpenny when hostilities ended. By 1918, it had a staff of 100, including one delivery van and one driver. The Graham family took a wider view of the newspaper industry, with Malcolm Graham – the current owner's late father – spending part of his twenties on newspapers in Canada, where he learnt from the slick \\"New World\\" style of journalism. On his return, he applied to the Express & Star the more modern approach he had seen first hand. By the 1930s, the circulation was more than 100,000 and the paper was part of a newspaper war which saw readers offered all manners of inducement to boost sales, such as tea-sets and holiday tokens. During the Second World War, newsprint restrictions meant the size of the paper was reduced by half. In response to the shortage, the design moved from broadsheet to tabloid. A comforts fund organised by the paper raised £160,000 over the course of the war, while the paper also became the first to sponsor a Spitfire collection fund. 1950s to 1970s The post-war period saw the company compete with new innovations such as television yet still push up sales by an average of 1,120 a year. Despite a national print dispute in 1959, the circulation rose to 201,594 copies a day. Until 1963, the MNA published the Express & Star, Wolverhampton Chronicle plus the Saturday football paper, all set in a conventional hot metal composing room and printed on five letterpress machines. In 1964, plans were made to hive off 19,000 copies of the Salop edition to create the Shropshire Star, published at a new photo-composed offset printing plant in Ketley. The board saw an opportunity with the growth of Dawley New Town – later renamed Telford – and produced a successful news and advertising product to serve a county which is a mixture of agriculture and industrial areas. Serving the largest inland county in the UK, both Shropshire Star and Shropshire Weekly Series cover all the major population centres within the circulation area. Innovation continued during the 1970s, with the MNA introducing the first VDU system and adopting computerised accounting, as well as facsimile transmission. 1980s to present day In the 1980s the MNA paved the way for the computer revolution in the British newspaper industry and has remained in the forefront of publishing technology. The Express & Star is firmly established the biggest- selling regional evening newspaper in Britain, while the Shropshire Star remains the fifth biggest, comfortably outselling metropolitan titles like the Birmingham Mail. The MNA continues to provide same-day news, with local editions for many communities. With innovations in areas such as iPad Apps and digital newspaper technology, it continues to be at the forefront of regional news more than 130 years after the Carnegie-Graham partnership. In December 2012 Midland News Association also launched its own recruitment agency, Star Employment Services, which operates from MNA’s headquarters in Queen Street, Wolverhampton. MNA Digital MNA Digital is the online branch of Midland News Association, being responsible for developing the websites expressandstar.com and shropshirestar.com and associated newspaper apps for iPad, iPhone, Android and Kindle Fire. 2016 saw a change in the service offering delivered by MNA Digital and the creation of a search marketing agency H1. H1 offers PPC (Paid Search) and SEO services to advertisers outside of MNA's traditional footprint, including fulfilling resold services to other publishers and marketing agencies.

On 11 September 2011, in a match against Coruxo FC, Iván scored his first goal for Castilla, also being sent off in the 1–1 away draw. He again received his marching orders on 16 October, now in a 0–1 away loss to Rayo Vallecano B. González returned to Málaga after his loan stint, but his remaining one-year contract was terminated and again signed with Castilla. Erzgebirge Aue On 20 September 2013, González joined German 2. Bundesliga club FC Erzgebirge Aue, signing a two-year deal and being given the number 32 shirt. On 30 September 2014, his contract was terminated by mutual consent. Later years González moved clubs and countries again in February 2015, signing with ASA Târgu Mureș in Romania. In late June 2016 he agreed to a two-year contract at AD Alcorcón, but left the following 4 January by mutual consent. On 11 January 2017, González switched to the Ekstraklasa with Wisła Kraków. On 8 August, he scored twice through penalties to help the hosts defeat Wisła Płock 2–1 in the round of 32 of the Polish Cup; in May 2018, it was announced he would be leaving at the end of the next month. On 17 July 2018, González joined Recreativo de Huelva. In May 2020, he announced his retirement from playing at the age of 32 due to injury problems. International career On 6 August 2010, González was called by coach Luis Milla to the Spanish under-21 team, for the 2011 UEFA European Championship qualifier against Finland. Four months earlier, he had already been summoned by the previous manager Juan Ramón López Caro, but eventually did not make his debut.

Facts Mrs Rutty was a warehouse assistant in Tonbridge, Kent packing educational toys for Commotion Ltd’s business. She and her husband had to take over care for their grand daughter, Jasmine. Mrs Rutty asked the warehouse supervisor, Mr Wood, for flexible working time, as a three-day week.

She appealed, and Mr Coote rejected her claim again, writing back saying that the company's policy was to ‘help to create a team spirit by having a uniform working day’. She resigned and claimed her application was unreasonably rejected, constructive unfair dismissal and indirect discrimination. Judgment=Tribunal The Tribunal held that there were no grounds on which the employer had shown that flexible working could not be accommodated, and hence its decision was based on incorrect facts.

It originally aired on January 18, 2010. The episode hit a season high with 10.52 million viewers and high overall ratings. The episode is directed by starring actor and first-time director Neil Patrick Harris. Plot Ted and Marshall walk into a college bar, and Ted is worried about meeting his students there. Marshall goes to the bar often to maintain his skeeball high score. Marshall tells him that Jenkins, a particularly quirky co-worker who has been the subject of a number of funny office stories that Marshall has told the group about, will be joining them. Because Marshall neglected to mention Jenkins's gender, Ted pictures Jenkins as a goofy fat man, and is therefore taken by surprise when Barney announces his intention to sleep with \\"Jenkins\\". He finally gets the resolution when Jenkins arrives and turns out to be a woman. Marshall begs Ted not to tell Lily, since he is afraid that she would be jealous when she finds out Jenkins' real gender, since some of the things that Jenkins had done was crazy (peeing out of a cab window, taking off her shirt as she dances on the table, etc). The next day, Lily unexpectedly shows up at Marshall's workplace, and finds out that Jenkins is a woman. However, she is not jealous or upset that he neglected to tell her Jenkins' gender. Ted and Robin theorize that in every relationship, one person is a \\"reacher\\", and one is a \\"settler\\", who settles for the less attractive partner. Marshall at first is offended and says that he did not \\"settle for Lily\\", but is upset when he realizes that Ted and Robin define him as a reacher. Marshall later asks Lily to classify herself and she says that she is a \\"settler\\", upsetting him even more. To prove that he can date more attractive women, Marshall plans to show Lily how Jenkins flirts with him. At his workplace, Jenkins kisses Marshall on impulse. Marshall runs home and apologizes to Lily, but she dismisses him as lying to make her jealous. Jenkins later apologizes to Marshall, saying she was drunk from a late-night drinking game. She plans to apologize to Lily, which Marshall eagerly urges her to do to prove to Lily that Jenkins really did kiss him. Lily calmly listens to Jenkins' apology, then proceeds to beat her up. Future Ted mentions that Marshall never tried to make Lily jealous again. In a separate story, Robin encounters fans of her pre-morning news show. At the college bar, one of Ted's students compliments Robin for her work. The next day, she interrupts Ted's class to announce that she is the show's host. After she leaves, Ted complains about how boring the show is and asks why would his students know her. The class explains to Ted that Robin is so hesitant when she does interviews that her constant interjections of \\"but um\\" are the basis for a drinking game, that game that Jenkins was playing, leading to her being drunk and sharing the kiss with Marshall. Ted and Barney test the game the next night, watching Robin's show, and get smashed. After Robin brags about her wide viewership, Ted explains the reason. That night, Ted joins his class for the game. Annoyed by the truth, Robin decides to repeat the phrase \\"but um\\" excessively, making those playing the game drink much more than usual. During the next day's class, Robin interrupts again, startling the hungover Ted and his students by shouting into a megaphone. Production Neil Patrick Harris made his directorial debut with the episode. This is especially unusual for the show, as Pamela Fryman directed the majority of the episodes before this. Of the previous 100 episodes, 94 were directed by Fryman, 5 were directed by Rob Greenberg and 1 was directed by Michael Shea, making Harris only the fourth different person to direct an episode of the show. Harris summarized the experience describing it as [sic] \\"Equal parts overwhelm, education, and exhilaration.\\" Harris' role is smaller in this episode due to directorial duties. Critical response Donna Bowman of The A.V. Club rated the episode with a grade B+. Brian Zoromski of IGN gave the episode 8.5 out of 10. TV Fanatic praised the role of Jenkins by Amanda Peet, while Amos Barshad of Vulture.com praised its humor.

Located to the east of Paris in Villiers-sur-Marne, the fort was part of an outer ring of eighteen major fortifications built in response to improvements in the range and effectiveness of artillery since the construction of the Thiers fortifications of the 1840s. It was built in accordance with improved principles of fortification developed for the Séré de Rivières system. The Fort de Villiers was built between 1878 and 1880 at an elevation of 111 meters, overlooking the Marne to the north and a rail line to the south, and was intended to deny the use of the height to an enemy. The fort was originally armed with eighteen long-range guns, ten smaller guns for the caponiers, and three mortars. Pre-surveyed fields of fire covered the neighboring Fort de Champigny at 3500m and the Fort de Chelles, 6200m away. The fort received 75mm anti-aircraft guns in 1915. The Fort de Villiers was the property of the Ministry of Defense until July 2001, when it was transferred to the community of Noisy-le-Grand, one of a series of new towns constructed around Paris. The fort covers seven hectares on the south side of A4 autoroute. It is linked to the town center of Noisy-le-Grand by a bridge over the autoroute. Until 2007 the fort housed community sports organizations. However, access to the fort has since been prohibited due to the state of the access bridge and the numerous dead trees resulting from the windstorms of late 1999. The Association de Sauvegarde du Fort De Villiers (ASFV) was established in 2008 to document and promote the preservation of the fort. It remains closed to the public.

He was several times returned to Parliament by the interest of the Duke of Marlborough, and precipitated a family quarrel with his nephew, the Duke of Gordon, by commandeering a regiment that the latter was raising. Military career He was the son of William Gordon, 2nd Earl of Aberdeen and his third wife Lady Anne Gordon. Educated at the University of Edinburgh, he was commissioned a cornet in the 11th Regiment of Dragoons in 1756. On 11 August 1759, he was appointed to a captaincy in the newly raised 16th Regiment of (Light) Dragoons. Appointed a lieutenant-colonel in the 105th Regiment of Foot (Queen's Own Royal Regiment of Highlanders) on 11 October 1762, he went on half-pay when that regiment was disbanded in 1763. On his grand tour of Europe, he passed through Rome, where he was painted by Pompeo Batoni in 1765–66, wearing the uniform of the 105th but with his tartan arranged like a toga. In 1767, Gordon was returned as Member of Parliament for Woodstock, through the influence of his friend the Duke of Marlborough. He was re-elected in 1768; in 1774, Marlborough put him in for Heytesbury instead. In Parliament, Gordon supported the Government, although his attendance was irregular. In 1775, Marlborough obtained for him an appointment as Groom of the Bedchamber to King George III, whom he served until 1812; Gordon was returned again for Heytesbury at the ensuing by-election. In 1777, Gordon became involved in a family quarrel with his nephew, Alexander Gordon, 4th Duke of Gordon. The Duke had offered to raise a new regiment for the King, with the intent of bestowing the colonelcy upon his brother, Lord William Gordon. King George objected, however, to Lord William, who had disgraced himself by eloping with and then abandoning Lady Sarah Bunbury. Gordon of Fyvie seized the opportunity to write to Lord Germain to request the colonelcy, assuring him of his nephew's support. He was breveted a colonel on 29 August 1777 and appointed colonel of the regiment on 19 December. However, the Duke discovered that Gordon of Fyvie had already chosen the officers of the regiment and written to them before he even knew if he would get the command; and the appointments, he thought, were arranged so as to threaten his electoral influence in Aberdeenshire. Ultimately, the Duke prevailed upon the King to raise a Fencible regiment under his personal command, but the competition in recruiting that followed created a permanent breach between the Duke and Fyvie's branch of the family, including his brother Sandy. Gordon remained a consistent supporter of the Government when not absent with his regiment. During the Gordon Riots of 1780, provoked by his nephew Lord George Gordon (then also an MP), Gordon of Fyvie asked him if he meant to admit the mob to the House of Commons and threatened to run him through with his sword if he did. Marlborough did not put him up for Heytesbury in the 1780 election, and Gordon made no attempt to contest Aberdeenshire. He was promoted major general on 19 October 1781. His regiment was disbanded in 1783, and he again went on half-pay. Gordon was appointed colonel-commandant of the 4th Battalion of the 60th Regiment of Foot on 3 October 1787, of the 7th Regiment of Foot (Royal Fuzileers) on 29 October 1788, and to the 71st (Highland) Regiment of Foot on 19 April 1789. Gordon was promoted lieutenant general on 12 October 1793 and general on 1 January 1798. He was appointed to the colonelcy of the 21st Regiment of Foot on 6 August 1803, which he commanded until his death. He lived at Martins Heron House at Winkfield in Berkshire. He married his housekeeper Isobel Black, by whom he had already had a son, William Gordon (? - 09-Jan-1847). ReferencesExternal links *\\"Colonel the Hon.

It is currently only in a single spring in the drainage basin of Lake Dianchi in Yunnan. Description Yunnanilus discoloris is so named because of the sexual dimorphism this species shows. The specific name discoloris means differently cloured, it refers to the sexually dimorphic colour pattern. The males have a black longitudinal stripe on both flanks with a light blackish stripe of spots along its back while the female shows black spotting and blotching on both the back and the flanks. It is a dwarf species which has a scaleless body and the origin of the dorsal fin is in halfway along the body. Habitat and distribution It is restricted to one tributary spring, the White Dragon Spring near Chenggong in Kunming, which flows into Lake Dianchi in Yunnan, southern China. The water in the spring, which lies at 1,886m above sea level, is clear with a bed consisting of sand with some stones and with a plant community made up of Ceratophyllum demersum, Spirogyra spp. and other species of macrophytes growing on the substrate. Conservation Yunnanilus discoloris has a very restricted range, the single spring in which it occurs contains introduced species and the spring has been modified by man. The spring is not protected and the IUCN assess the status of this species as Critically Endangered. There may be 500 individuals in the White Dragon Spring. It formerly occurred in Lake Dianchi but its extirpation from there is thought to have been the result of the introduction of black carp, grass carp, silver carp and bighead carp into the lake, as well as pollution and the resultant loss of macrophytes.

From 1982 to 1986, Luis Enrique Camejo attended the lessons of the Pinar del Río School of Art, before entering the National Art School in Havana from 1986 to 1990. Finally, he graduated from the Superior Art Institute of Havana (ISA) in 1996. Since 1996, Luis teaches Plastic Arts at the Superior Art Institute of Havana.  Artistic style  Luis Enrique Camejo's favourites themes are the relationship between man and his environment - especially urban environment at night - and Time. These themes are materialized by lights and colours effects such as blurring or dripping, in order to evocate the speed of modern times, with just some details clear in the vagueness like a tree or - paradoxically - a car.

The island currently houses over 100 cottages owned by both American and Canadian citizens. History Stag Island used to be a resort destination in the early 20th century until Great Lakes cruises went out of favour due to the introduction of cars. As of 1903, there was a beach, 100-room hotel, 6- to 8-room cottages, a dining hall, and sports and amusements. Transport to the island was via Star Line Steamers with rail transit available to the mainland dock. By 1906, another hotel had been built and a pavilion was advertised with a dining room and ball room. (It's not clear if this was an upgrade to the dining hall mentioned initially, or if it was an additional food establishment.) One of these facilities was called \\"La Salle Hall\\". Products sold in the dining hall were also offered for purchase at Island Farm. All park buildings by then had electric lighting and drinking water. A total of 23 cottages were available. Amusements included croquet, tennis, bowling, bathing, boating, and fishing - with accessories and a guide provided. The island seems to have fallen on harder times after World War I. Although season rates were up to $150, the hotel base rates were $1.00 - $1.50 per day and as low as only $8 per week in 1921. The following year, the park came under new management. Still, business must have declined because cottages and land began to be offered for sale in the area, many at bargain rates. A July 2, 1925, ad states \\"At Stag Island - 10 Cottages to Rent\\". Ads on July 12 and July 19 still offered cottages. Although this was for weekends, it shows that accommodations not available in previous years that late after the start of the season, were able to be rented. However, a roller coaster was built there around 1928. Canadian astronaut, Chris Hadfield, in the introduction to his book, An Astronaut's Guide to Life on Earth, mentions staying at the family summer cottage on Stag Island when he was 9 years old, when very late in the evening of July 20, 1969 he watched Neil Armstrong step on the surface of the Moon. He knew, \\"with absolute clarity\\" that he wanted to be an astronaut. Category:River islands of Ontario Category:Islands of the St. Clair River In the 1890s, Stag Island was a resort destination, with a single owner in the lumber business, ships coming up from Detroit and a large dance hall close to the water. With the coming of the automobile-which initially seduced people to more glamorous summer excursions-and the intervention of the First World War, the resort fell into disuse. In 1919, a group of investors bought the island and formed the Fraternal Fellowship Association (FFA), which still exists today. The association's bylaws limit residence on the island to cottagers, although the land itself can't be purchased, just the structures. Every owner has a share in the FFA, so in essence, ownership is communal. Cottages can occupy only a modest footprint. No motor vehicles are allowed on the island, only bicycles, lawn mowers and two golf carts for helping residents transport luggage from the ferry. And no one can build a fence.

Biography Born in South River, New JerseyStaff. \\"GENOVA GALLERIA D'ARTE IL BASILISCO: JONATHAN JANSON, DAILY LIFE ACQUERELLI E OLII\\", Genova Press, October 16, 2006. Accessed February 6, 2011. \\"JONATHAN JANSON nasce nel 1950 a South River, New Jersey, USA.\\" and raised in upstate New York and Florida, Janson graduated from the Rhode Island School of Design (Providence, Rhode Island) in 1972 with a major in painting. The turning point in his studies came when in 1969 he visited the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston, Mass., where he saw Johannes Vermeer’s \\"Concert.\\" This small but perfect masterpiece left a profound impression on the emergent painter decisively orienting his artistic direction. In his senior year at R.I.S.D. he studied in Rome, Italy, having been selected for the European Honors Program at Palazzo Cenci. After a brief return to his home in Florida, Janson returned to Rome (where he continues to live and work until today) to deepen his studies of 17th-century European painting and establish his family. In this period of creative incubation, Janson came to grips with the complexities of organizing detailed, multi-layered figurative painting. Janson put together a group of small, tightly composed interior paintings and suburban landscapes manifestly inspired by Vermeer in which the artist updated the Dutch painter's motifs of contemporary life. A Roman art dealer organized Janson's first solo show in 1980 which introduced his work to the Italian art public. Shortly after, he began showing with the influential Galleria Forni, Bologna which exposed his work to an international audience. Janson continued to refine his technique while exploring the cultural continuum of Dutch genre themes such as reading, writing, family life and music making. In 1983, after a summer sojourn in his native Florida, Janson painted a series of minimalist watercolors inspired by the harsh, semitropical environment of the suburban Florida landscape. The most characteristic motifs of this series are devoid of human presence, which, however, is incessantly signaled by cars moving along highways or parked quietly in anonymous strip-mall parking lots or gas stations. These small scenes are characterized by intense backlighting which frames the voids and unnoticed events of America's daily life. The artist's deft touch and two or three color palette draws inspiration from the topographical studies of William Turner and the New England watercolors of Edward Hopper. In 1984 Janson presented a group of the Florida watercolors in a solo-exhibition at the historical photo-realist O.K. Harris Gallery, New York. In the years which follow, he took part in more than 50 group and 30 solo exhibitions until the most recent in late 2009, a solo-exhibition of Seattle and Florida suburban landscapes unified by a mute gray palette and severe weather conditions. Janson continues to work alternately in the two parallel modes of painting: landscape watercolors and interior oil paintings. Internet Responding to the internet medium, Janson created a website called Essential Vermeer in 2001. Essential Vermeer has developed into the primary internet resource for Vermeer studies and the most comprehensive website dedicated to a single painter. Essential Vermeer presents a balanced in-depth study of the life, art and cultural milieu of Johannes Vermeer comprising hundreds of web pages, thousands of images, collaborative studies, interviews with Vermeer notables and multi-media features. The site includes a complete interactive catalogue of the Dutch artist which permits the navigator to access extensive information on each work using images mapping and expandable topic boxes. Janson issues a free newsletter which keeps thousands of subscribers informed about Vermeer-related exhibitions, publications and multi-media events. Janson's commitment has brought the Essential Vermeer to the attention of art historians and specialists in 17th-century Dutch art as well as writers who use it regularly as a reference point. He travels extensively and is in constant contact with museum personnel and art historians involved with Dutch genre painting and specifically with the work of Vermeer. Television and documentary film In 2002, Janson was commissioned by the American Hallmark Hall of Fame to paint a hypothetical Vermeer for the television adaptation Brush with Fate, based on Susan Vreeland's best-selling novel Girl in Hyacinth Blue. It was broadcast on CBS a year after. In 2009, Janson is featured in a documentary Views on Vermeer: 12 Short Stories by Hans Pool and Koos de Wilt. The film presents influential contemporary painters, writers, photographers, art historians and opinion leaders who unravel the extraordinary and mysterious impact of the 17th century Delft master Johannes Vermeer in our day and age. Writings In 2006, Janson published his first book, How to Paint Your Own Vermeer: The Methods and Materials of a Seventeenth-Century Master, mainly thought as a manual for practicing painters who wish to emulate the great Dutch Master's technique and style. In addition to the book he produced a CD, How to Paint Your Own Vermeer. A Painting in Progress which documents the painting of an interior done in the style of Vermeer with sequential images that enhance the textual contents of How to Paint Your Own Vermeer. His second publication, Looking Over Vermeer’s Shoulders. A Study of the Painting Methods and Materials of Johannes Vermeer is an adaptation from the first one, a comprehensible guide to anyone who is interested in exploring the mysterious relationship between painting technique and artistic expression, as well as the mental and physical machinery of Johannes Vermeer, one of the greatest painting technicians of all time.

Early life Born in Atherstone, Warwickshire, Barnes left school at 12, to help provide for his family. He worked in various coal mines, as well as a bakery. His football career began as an amateur for Atherstone Town. He signed on professional terms for Coventry City in March 1928. Alt URL Professional career Barnes played eight consecutive games for Coventry at the end of the 1927–28 season. One of these matches—a 2–2 draw with Crystal Palace—was the lowest attendance in Coventry's history, attracting 2,059 spectators. After being confined to Coventry's reserves the following season, Barnes joined Walsall in June 1929. He stayed there for two years, scoring 18 goals in 68 appearances as they recorded consecutive 17th-placed finishes in the Third Division South. In July 1931 he joined Watford, managed by Neil McBain. After 83 games and 11 goals for the Vicarage Road based club, he was transfer listed for an asking price of £300, before eventually joining Exeter City for a third of that figure. His stay in Exeter lasted just one season, before he joined what would be his last professional club, York City, in August 1934. Barnes played 15 York City games, scoring once, before retiring from professional football due to a foot injury. Alt URL Barnes rejoined first club Atherstone Town as an amateur in 1935. After football Following his retirement, Barnes worked in a munitions factory during the Second World War, and later did work as a painter/decorator, plumber and tanner. His family included wife Nancy, daughter Janet (who later had two children Angela and Paul), and he lived to see all four of his grandchildren, Jenna, Matthew, Naomi and Niall. Apart from football, Barnes' sporting interests included golf, boxing, cricket, swimming and greyhound racing. Barnes considered becoming a professional golfer in 1938, and although he did not pursue this possibility, he continued playing until the age of 93. Barnes died from Alzheimer's disease in a nursing home in Coleshill, Warwickshire, only 27 days before his 100th birthday. Prior to his death, he was the oldest surviving former Football League player and one of the last surviving professional footballers to have played before World War II.

In the episode, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agents investigate the confessions of a mob hit man before his execution. Written by Julie Hébert, the episode also highlighted the return of series regular Peter MacNicol as his character, Dr. Larry Fleinhardt, returned from space. \\"The Art of Reckoning\\" first aired in the United States on April 27, 2007. Critics gave the episode positive reviews. The episode was also a favorite for lead actor David Krumholtz. Plot summary Drs. Charlie Eppes (David Krumholtz) and Amita Ramanujan (Navi Rawat), Charlie's girlfriend and colleague, watch the space shuttle carrying their friend and colleague Dr. Larry Fleinhardt (Peter MacNicol) from the International Space Station land at Edwards Air Force Base in California. Meanwhile, FBI Special Agent Don Eppes (Rob Morrow), Charlie's brother, accompanies Assistant United States Attorney Alvin Brickle (Jeremy Sisto) to a California prison to visit death row inmate Pony Fuñez (Wood Harris), who is scheduled to be executed within the week. Fuñez, a former mob hit man, claims that he could lead Don and Brickle to the body of a mobster and can tell Don what happened to Senator Randall Amato (Bruce MacVittie)'s son (Preston Bailey), who disappeared in 1997. FBI Special Agents David Sinclair (Alimi Ballard) and Colby Granger (Dylan Bruno) find the mobster's body exactly as Fuñez described, proving Fuñez' legitimacy and his claim to having an eidetic memory. To obtain information about Senator Amato's son, Charlie, at the FBI office trying to reach Larry at Edwards Air Force Base, suggests using tit-for-tat to exchange information with Fuñez. Reluctantly, Don transfers Fuñez to the FBI office for questioning. David, in the meantime, goes to Fuñez’s house to talk to Rene Moreno (Rosa Evangelina Arredondo), Fuñez’s wife, and discovers that Lucy Fuñez (Rhyon Nicole Brown), Fuñez’s daughter, wants to see her father before his execution. Back at the office, Don lets Fuñez see the picture of Lucy that Rene gave David. Fuñez offers the location of the body of Senator Amato’s son. He also describes the death of the boy and the weather conditions for the night in question. This time, the team finds the body of a mob leader, and Don refuses to cooperate with the hit man. At Charlie's house, Don finds Charlie and their father, Alan Eppes (Judd Hirsch), barbecuing to celebrate Larry's return. Don informs Charlie of the situation, and Charlie suggests cooperating when Fuñez refuses to, tit-for-two-tats, in hopes of Fuñez cooperating again. The team determines that a living mob leader killed the dead leader to gain control of the mob. A polygraph test ordered by Senator Amato demonstrates that Fuñez is telling the truth about the death of the senator’s son. Meanwhile, Larry surprises Charlie by showing up at CalSci to see Charlie and although mistakenly calls the knotted cords \\"Aztec\\" Quipu, he explains the meaning. Larry invites Charlie to the beach where Larry had been staying since his return to Earth. There, Charlie learns that Larry is experiencing space transcendence and does not want to lose that feeling. Charlie and Larry return to the FBI office, where Larry is greeted by Don. They heard Fuñez's confession about Senator Amato's son, and Larry realizes that Fuñez has confabulated his memories of the night the boy was killed. Charlie and Don use fMRI to determine the truth about Fuñez's memories. The fMRI seems to confirm the polygraph test. When Charlie confronts Fuñez with contradictory weather conditions for the night in question, Fuñez tells Don that the mob leader killed Senator Amato's son. Fuñez's description confirms Colby's earlier suspicion that Fuñez could not bring himself to kill a child. A FBI team finds the child's body right where Fuñez said it was. Meanwhile, David and Brickle, en route to Fuñez's house to talk to Rene, engage in a shootout with a couple of members of the mob. As a result of Fuñez's cooperation, Don personally brings Lucy to the FBI office to see her father before his execution. After enjoying an al fresco dinner with Alan and Charlie at the house, Larry informs Charlie that he will be staying at the Buddhist temple in Altadena, California, for a spiritual retreat. Production=Casting notes Wood Harris, formerly on The Wire, and Jeremy Sisto, of Kidnapped, guest-starred in \\"The Art of Reckoning\\". It also marked the final appearance of season three for Kathy Najimy's character, Dr. Millie Finch. Although scheduled to appear in two to three episodes, Najimy's role was expanded to cover series regular Peter MacNicol's departure to film 24. Writing \\"The Art of Reckoning\\" marked series regular Peter MacNicol's return to Numb3rs after wrapping up \\"24\\". During the filming of season three, writers and producers learned that MacNicol would return to Numb3rs. Writers then wrote a story which explored Larry's new attitude since his mission. According to creator and executive producer Cheryl Heuton, producers were uncertain as to the date of MacNicol's return, but, as of an interview with TVGuide.com's Michael Ausiello, they already developed a few story ideas to write Larry back into the script. Shortly after MacNicol's return to the series, he became a regular again. Reception Over 10.15 million people watched \\"The Art of Reckoning\\". Cynthia Boris of DVD Verdict calls the episode \\"well plotted, engaging\\". The episode also was a favorite episode for actor David Krumholtz as it highlighted some of Larry’s inner struggles.

Overview Masindi Port was a busy river boat docking station during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Steamboats were a major mode of transport on the Nile River. Because of the Karuma Falls and the Murchison Falls on the Victoria Nile between Lake Kyoga and Lake Albert, steamboats could not navigate that part of the Nile. Passengers would travel by boat from Lake Victoria, down the Victoria Nile into Lake Kyoga. They would then disembark at Masindi Port and travel by land to Butiaba, a port on Lake Albert, where they would resume their water journey downstream the Nile. With the decline of this mode of river transportation, Masindi Port and Butiaba have been reduced to mainly market towns. Population In 2009, the Uganda Bureau of Statistics estimated the population of Masindi Port at about 10,400.

Born near Sturgis, Michigan, Skirvin left for the Oklahoma Territory in 1889 as an original 89er. He and a business partner acquired, and then sold, property in the new territorial capital of Guthrie, then moved to Galveston, Texas to engage in the real estate business. Skirvin developed the town of Alta Loma, and was present in Galveston at the time of the 1900 Galveston hurricane. Skirvin also engaged in the oil business with considerable success. Skirvin returned to Oklahoma in 1906 to engage in both oil and real estate endeavors. In 1910-1911 he built the Skirvin Hotel; he and his children lived in a suite on the ninth floor. Repeatedly expanded, the hotel became the city's best known, and a center of its political and business life. In 1931 he and his family began a second hotel, the Skirvin Tower, but due to the economic instability of the era, it was not completed until 1938; it was converted into an office building in the 1970s.Blackburn, Bob L.

Early life Alberti was the son of a flour miller. He did not regularly attend school due to the distance between his parents' house and the local school. However, the miller's apprentice, Jan Mulder, taught the boy to read. He made good progress, and soon the teacher took his student with him to the church. To his amazement, he noticed that the boy kept his attention on the pulpit. When Alberti returned home, his mother asked him if he remembered anything that had been said. He stood upon a wooden crate in the living room, recited the text of the sermon, and declaimed parts of it with such simplicity that his mother had tears in her eyes. From that moment on, the parents had the hope that their child could aim for something higher than the work of his parents. And he did not disappoint them: after having risen to the top of his class at the Latin school, he was sent to the University of Franeker in 1718. Here, he immersed himself in the study of Antiquity with Lambertus Bos and Campegius Vitringa. Vitringa also gave him a thorough education in theology. When he finished his studies in Franeker after six years, he was known as a person with excellent ability who held great promise for the advancement of science and his homeland. Minister On 26 January 1721, Alberti was confirmed as a minister in Hoogwoud. Here, following the examples of Elsner, Raphelius, his teacher Bos and some other theologians, he collected passages and sayings from non-Christian texts that were similar to those used in the Greek language New Testament. He collected them in order to defend the style of the Evangelists and Apostles against scholars who considered these writers' style as poor and full of Hebrew sayings. The results of this careful research were published by Alberti in 1725 in his Letterkundige Aanteekeningen op de gewijde Schriften des Nieuwen Verbonds (Literary notes made on the sacred scriptures of the New Testament). This work did not have a running explanation. Instead, it highlighted some aspects of the Christian holy books by comparing them with the works of other Greek writers, explaining why the language used in the Old Testament was necessary, and indicating the best interpretation according to Alberti. He did all of this without ignoring the explanations of other theologians. Although it was lauded by many, the notes were mocked in the Acta Eruditorum, a critical journal published in Latin in Leipzig, and the young scholar was accused of plagiarism. Alberti replied to this in 1727 with a new publication, Kritische Proeve (Critical Essay), where he justified his earlier work extensively in the preamble and where he showed an extraordinary knowledge of Greek dictionaries and grammars. This thorough knowledge, developed in a work of only some 100 pages, showed the independent writer to be a staunch defender of Biblical truth and silenced his enemies. Shortly thereafter he made a Proeve van Kritische aanmerkingen nopens Hesychius (Essay on critical remarks concerning Hesychius), followed by numerous literary remarks to explain some passages in the New Testament of Philo Judaeus. These two works were presented in foreign journals, instead of appearing as independent publications. Because Alberti dedicated himself to skills that were necessary and useful to a valuable minister and servant of the word of God, his fame as a preacher spread far and wide, and he was relocated from Hoogwoud to Krommenie in 1726 and to Haarlem in 1728. During his stay in Haarlem, he planned to make a new version of the dictionary of Hesychius of Alexandria. To make this work as complete as possible, he searched relentlessly and collected new sources everywhere. Among the papers presented to him for this purpose by Hamburg professor Johann Albert Fabricius was an old unpublished Greek dictionary of the New Testament. Comparing this with another he found later in the library of the University of Leiden and with a very old manuscript offered to him by his friend, the scholar Tiberius Hemsterhuis, Alberti succeeded in enriching the study of the Greek language with a new Greek dictionary of the New Testament, coupled with a very extensive list of ancient Greek authors who were mentioned in the Lexicon of Photios I of Constantinople. Professor After returning in 1740 from a long trip to the neighbouring countries, Alberti was offered the position of professor of theology at the University of Leiden, which he accepted on 5 October with a speech on the combination of Theology and Judgment. From the moment he became professor, he tried to promote a free and discerning explanation of the Bible with his students. One of the consequences of this openness was that he became involved in the difficulties and persecution of one of his most proficient students, Antony van der Os, a teacher from Zwolle. The opponents of this teacher not only accused him of having learned his (in their opinion) incorrect views from Alberti, who hid behind the scenes and kept silent, but also openly declared that because of Alberti's teachings, the pure Reformed theology at the University of Leuden would be corrupted. The softhearted, calm Alberti, who had stated in one of his earliest books that only a bad understanding of the books of the Bible could lead to disputes in the church, was careful and intelligent enough not to appear to be bothered by the attacks of his enemies, even though he was well aware that the attacks were aimed especially against him. As a result, his unpublished academic lessons were openly attacked in an anonymous publication, Examen van het onderwerp van tolerantie, om de leer, in de Dordrechtsche Synode, ten jare 1619, vastgesteld, met de veroordeelde leer der Remonstranten te vereenigen, door een genootschap van voorstanders der Nederlandsche formulieren van eenigheid, in which Alberti was presented with the name Euruodius (\\"Wide gatekeeper\\"). Alberti responded with disdain to the ill-conceived language of his unrestrained but learned enemies. However, his colleague Albert Schultens defended him and his teachings with warmth. During his professorship in Leiden, Alberti once held the position of rector, a position he withdrew from on 8 February 1749 with the speech Over het Nut der poëzy voor de Godgeleerden (On the use of Poetry in Theology). This speech was translated into Low German by Nozeman and put into verse by Pieter Merkman. Illness Meanwhile, Alberti continued his beloved literary exercises and published in Leiden in 1746 the first part of Hesychius' dictionary. The scholars were not disappointed at the publication, and the book confirmed the great fame of Alberti. He was already far along in writing the second part of the dictionary when, in 1749, he was diagnosed with tuberculosis. The baths of Aachen and Spa, which he visited to find relief, suppressed the disease, but for three years he was unable to work. Even after his slow recovery, he was left with a persistent, partial paralysis of his hands, such that he could barely lift the pages of his books and found it very hard to write. Nevertheless, he continued to work for ten more years. He had finished the complete alphabet of Hesychius except for a few letters, when he succumbed to scarlet fever. The second part of the dictionary of Hesychius appeared in Leyden in 1762 due to the efforts of Ruhnkenius. Alberti had no children with his wife. She was the daughter of Mr. Philips van Ravestein, a man with knowledge in many disciplines. Legacy For almost twenty-two years, Alberti had been a jewel of the University of Leiden. Through his lessons, he made major contributions toward a more accurate theology based on knowledge of the Greek language. His many writings exemplify the versatility of his knowledge. An excellent theologian and one of the best scholars of Biblical hermeneutics of his time, he also was filled with the spirit of Greek literature and with the very essence of it. He even had some skill with the lyre. Furthermore, he was no stranger to the literature and poetry of the Netherlands and succeeded in using this knowledge in his main studies. In his works, many traces of comparative linguistics can be found, clear evidence of his studies of the Dutch language. He was also proficient in Nordic History and Literature. He expressed gratitude toward his teacher, Lambertus Bos, in many of his writings. He helped other scholars by making all the manuscripts that he owned available to all linguists. The following examples provide evidence of this helpfulness. When the Frisian scholar, Gijsbert Koen, worked on a publication of Gregory of Corinth, it was through Alberti that he received an important manuscript of his literary work from Basel. When Alberti heard that Johannes Pierson, the rector of Leeuwarden, was working on an edition of Moeris Atticista, he sent, without invitation, his own manuscript version of a very accurate comparison with the Leiden manuscript, previously owned by Gerhard Johann Vossius.

The ashes of Kasturba Gandhi, wife of Mahatma Gandhi, are kept in this memorial. The mental asylum of Pune is also located at Yerawada. Yerawada Jail This is the largest jail in the State of Maharashtra. The most notable people to be incarcerated at the jail is Mahatma Gandhi, who spent several years there during India's struggle for freedom. Yerwada Central Jail entrance. A programme designed to spread Gandhian principles in Yerwada prison was introduced in Yerawada prison in 2002 by Asim Sarode, founder of Sahyog Trust. As part of the programme, the prison inmates are taught Gandhian principles for one year, at the end of the year, they have to appear for an examination. Admission to the course is optional. Four years after the initiation of the course, Sahyog Trust conducted a survey amongst the prison inmates to check the degree of awareness of Gandhian principles. The results of the survey were encouraging as 94 per cent expressed respect for Gandhi. A majority 77 per cent of them believed that social change can be brought about by love and friendship. Also, 66 per cent of them showed the willingness to apologise to the victim’s family and seek forgiveness from them. Taking the Gandhian principles and ideas to the prisoners has led to a marked improvement in the levels of discipline at the prison. According to the Deputy Inspector General (DIG) of police of the western region, Rajendra Dhamne, “the course has definitely contributed to the maintenance of peace inside the prison. The number of violent incidents amongst the inmates has comparatively reduced.” The result of the survey has given a boost to the aforementioned Trust’s initiatives. It has also proved that even those judged as criminals have a human side to them and in many cases they only take to crime due to compelling circumstances (poverty, political disenfranchisement). The course adopts a reformist approach to tackling crime in the society.

This is a historical monument which is visited by hundreds of people daily. Sir Sultan Mohammed Shah, Aga Khan III, ordered the construction of the palace in 1892 to provide employment to the people of the nearby areas, who had been famished. Prince Karim El Husseni, Aga Khan IV, donated the palace to India in 1969, in the honor of Gandhiji Andrew his philosophy. Aga Khan Palace is also known as Gandhi National Memorial because of its close association with Mahatma Gandhi. One of the major attractions of the Aga Khan Palace is the samadhis (memorials) of Kasturba Gandhi (wife of Mahatma Gandhi) and Mahadev Desai (a long-time aid of Mahatma Gandhi). Since both of them breathed their last in there, Charles Correa got their samadhis built in the grounds of the palace itself. Gandhi's ashes are also interred at the Gandhi National Memorial of Poona. Exhibitions are held at the palace on a regular basis to acquaint people with the life and career of Mahatma Gandhi. The palace served as the venue for the movie Gandhi. Since 1980, the management of the museum, samadhis and campus of the Agakhan Palace is under the Gandhi Memorial Society. The museum inside the palace complex has a collection of pictures depicting almost all the important incidents in the life of Mahatma Gandhi. There is also a wide assortment of his personal items like utensils, clothes, malas, chappals (slippers), letter written by Gandhiji on the death of his secretary, etc. Sukha and Jinda Harjinder Singh Jinda and Sukdev Singh Sukha were imprisoned in this prison in 1992 for assassinating Indian Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Gen.

Flat-panel detectors are a class of solid-state x-ray digital radiography devices similar in principle to the image sensors used in digital photography and video. They are used in both projectional radiography and as an alternative to x-ray image intensifiers (IIs) in fluoroscopy equipment.  Principles  Light spreading in the scintillator material leads to loss of resolution in indirect detectors which direct detectors do not experience X-rays pass through the subject being imaged and strike one of two types of detectors. Indirect detectors Indirect detectors contain a layer of scintillator material, typically either gadolinium oxysulfide or cesium iodide, which converts the x-rays into light. Directly behind the scintillator layer is an amorphous silicon detector array manufactured using a process very similar to that used to make LCD televisions and computer monitors. Like a TFT-LCD display, millions of roughly 0.2 mm pixels each containing a thin-film transistor form a grid patterned in amorphous silicon on the glass substrate. Unlike an LCD, but similar to a digital camera's image sensor chip, each pixel also contains a photodiode which generates an electrical signal in proportion to the light produced by the portion of scintillator layer in front of the pixel. The signals from the photodiodes are amplified and encoded by additional electronics positioned at the edges or behind the sensor array in order to produce an accurate and sensitive digital representation of the x-ray image. Direct FPDs Direct conversion imagers utilize photoconductors, such as amorphous selenium (a-Se), to capture and convert incident x-ray photons directly into electric charge.Direct vs. Indirect Conversion X-ray photons incident upon a layer of a-Se generate electron-hole pairs via the internal photoelectric effect. A bias voltage applied to the depth of the selenium layer draw the electrons and holes to corresponding electrodes; the generated current is thus proportional to the intensity of the irradiation. Signal is then read out using underlying readout electronics, typically by a thin-film transistor (TFT) array. By eliminating the optical conversion step inherent to indirect conversion detectors, lateral spread of optical photons is eliminated, thus reducing blur in the resulting signal profile in direct conversion detectors. Coupled with the small pixel sizes achievable with TFT technology, a-Se direct conversion detectors can thus provide high spatial resolution. This high spatial resolution, coupled with a-Se's relative high quantum detection efficiency for low energy photons (< 30 keV), motivate the use of this detector configuration for mammography, in which high resolution is desirable to identify microcalcifications.M.J. Yaffe, “Detectors for Digital Mammography,” in Digital Mammography, edited by U. Bick and F. Diekmann (2010). Advantages and disadvantages Flat-panel detector used in digital radiography Flat-panel detectors are more sensitive and faster than film. Their sensitivity allows a lower dose of radiation for a given picture quality than film. For fluoroscopy, they are lighter, far more durable, smaller in volume, more accurate, and have much less image distortion than x-ray image intensifiers and can also be produced with larger areas. Disadvantages compared to IIs can include defective image elements, higher costs and lower spatial resolution. In general radiography, there are time and cost savings to be made over computed radiography and (especially) film systems. In the United States, digital radiography is on course to surpass use of computed radiography and film. In mammography, direct conversion FPDs have been shown to outperform film and indirect technologies in terms of resolution, signal-to-noise ratio, and quantum efficiency. Digital mammography is commonly recommended as the minimum standard for breast screening programmes.

The remote control fishing boats are almost exclusively battery operated, since batteries provide several benefits when compared with glow engines: less noise during operation, consume no power during idle time, requires no oxygen, easier to maintain, finer power and speed control, etc. Remote Control Fishing Boats Remote control fishing boats are either modified RC boats or custom build RC fishing boats. Theoretically, as long as a fishing line can be attached to the remote control boat, any remote control boat can be used. But, good electric RC fishing boat should be: \\\\- water tight up to a certain depth - if pulled down by larger fish, it should stay operational after being submerged, \\\\- visible from long distances - if fishermen lose the RC boat out of sight, it is very hard to bring it back again, \\\\- have enclosed propellers or small jets - fishing lines, sea-grass and various debris can get entangled around unprotected propellers and can prevent the RC boat from operating normally, \\\\- rudder should be omitted or should be enclosed with propellers - if two electric engines are used, rudder can be omitted and boat steering is done using electric motors, \\\\- have low center of gravity - boat is stable and can handle bad weather, waves and wind, \\\\- should be mono-hull - mono-hull RC boats with low center of gravity always position them properly (even after being fully upside down) and, if they are water tight, can resume operation right away. Catamaran RC fishing boats are very stable boats, but when turned upside-down due to wind, waves, fish etc., they are unable to return to proper position on their own. Regardless of hull type, hulls should be strong, durable and water tight and should be able to withstand hits and impacts with boats, debris, rocks etc. \\\\- batteries should be swapped easily, with minimum tools required. NiMh batteries are common in most RC boats, with NiCd batteries being slowly phased-out due to environmental concerns, battery memory effect, lower capacity and generally being inferior to NiMh batteries. High-end models of RC boats are mostly powered with strong, lightweight and expensive lithium polymer batteries. \\\\- electric motors should be brushless electric motors. Brushless motors are more expensive and require more complex motor controllers, but they require less maintenance and are more reliable than brushed electric motors, \\\\- boat should be able to achieving various (trolling) speeds, not just to have simple motors 'off and on'. etc. Fishing Methods There are several fishing methods that are usually employed: \\\\- A section of fishing line and baited hook are permanently attached to a remote control boat. Using remote control, bait is positioned on desired location and fishermen either wait for a fish to strike or use RC boat for trolling. The limitation of this method is if a big fish is hooked, there is a risk of the fish pulling the remote control boat underwater. \\\\- Attach a line release mechanism to the RC boat and then attach the line/hook and (instead of casting) drive the line out with the RC boat. When a fish strikes, the line disconnects, and the fisherman reels in the fish with a regular fishing pole. This allows the fisherman to catch any size fish. \\\\- Similar to the previous method; RC fishing boat is equipped with line release mechanism and when on desired position, line is released by fishing rod strike or by remote command. After fishing line is released, RC boat is retrieved using remote control or even automatically using some sort of homing system (ultra sound, infra red, GPS, etc.). RC fishing methods are limited only by imagination of RC fishing boat users. Line Release Mechanism Line release mechanism can be attached to any suitable RC boat. Instead of using fast electric RC boats, slower, but stronger and more durable RC boats should be used. Line release mechanism is mounted on the stern of the boat, so that the fishing line stays clear of propellers, rudders, antenna and any other protrusions. Also, line release mechanism can be improvised using various methods, mostly using ordinary plastic clothespin requiring some testing before such system can be actually used.  Legal status  There is debate about whether RC fishing should be legal. Most states will allow it if the line disconnects when a fish is hooked to the boat, and the fisherman reels in the fish with a fishing pole. When the RC boat is used to pull in the fish, it may be illegal unless on private property.

He is most widely known for his participation in the War of American Independence, where he saw action in the Battle of Cape Henry in 1781 and in the Battle of the Saintes in 1782.  Biography  Destouches was born in Luçon, in Vendée, in 1727. He joined the French Navy, and by 1767 was a Captain. In 1770 he married a young woman from Luçon; she bore him a son, Adrien, in 1772, and died while he was away at sea. After France entered the American War of Independence 1778, Destouches commanded the 74-gun Neptune, part of a fleet led by the Comte de Grasse that eventually occupied Newport, Rhode Island. In 1781, now a rear admiral and in command of the Newport fleet, he led an attempt to deliver troops to Virginia to oppose those of the British general Benedict Arnold, who was engaged in the raids against economic and military targets there. This effort failed when he encountered the fleet of Admiral Mariot Arbuthnot in the Battle of Cape Henry, and drew away after several of his ships sustained significant damage. He served in 1782 under de Grasse in the Battle of the Saintes, a decisive naval victory for the British in the West Indies in which de Grasse was captured. Returning to France after the war, Destouches married again in 1785, to Aimée-Prudence-Geneviève de Racodet. He was promoted to Chef d'Escadre in 1788, having spent 46 years at sea. When the French Revolution broke out, Destouches sided with the Royalists, and was drawn into counter-revolutionary activities in the Vendée in 1793. Briefly imprisoned, he was released by Royalist supporters, and he served as an advisor in the Battle of Savenay. He died during the winter in late 1793.

Its mission is to provide a streamlined, efficient purchasing portal for federal agencies to acquire the goods and services needed. The purpose in creating this service was threefold. First to reduce the time, cost and bureaucracy in purchasing goods and services, second to ensure the lowest possible price was obtained and third is to verify contractors are qualified to sell to the federal government. The government's description of the service is as stated: \\"Is the Federal Government's premier online shopping superstore. With online access to millions of commercial products and services, GSA Advantage! ensures you are getting GSA-negotiated prices from GSA-approved sources.\\" The service is intended to benefit any federal agency that has access to the GSA Advantage program; however, two federal acts have allowed state and local governments to access and purchase from this service. Section 833 of the John Warner National Defense Authorization Act authorizes the Administrator of General Services to provide state and local governments the use of GSA's Federal Supply Schedules for the purchase of products and services to be used to facilitate recovery from a major disaster, terrorism or nuclear, biological, chemical, or radiological attack. Further Section 211 of the E-Government Act of 2002 authorized GSA sales of IT products and services to state and local governments through the introduction of cooperative purchasing. U.S. departments like Homeland Security, National Guards, U.S. Air Force, U.S. Army, Louisiana Guards, and many other departments work under GSA. Purchasing Purchasing agencies access the goods and services available in GSA Advantage through their website,GSA Advantage Website. The site markets the products or services much like any other online merchant. The product and services can be shopped by category, supplier or descriptive terms. The site provides detailed product information including the GSA negotiated price for each item. This information is available to the public and requires no preauthorization to view. The site requires an agency to \\"Sign in\\" with a user created user name and password to initiate a purchase. Product categories The site lists the items and services provided under GSA Advantage into the following condensed categories. Each category can represent thousands of products: * Building & Industrial * Furniture & Furnishings * Cleaning & Chemicals * IT Solutions & Electronics * Laboratory, Cleaning, Medical * Law Enforcement, Fire, Security * Office Solutions * Recreational & Apparel * Services * Tools, Hardware, Machinery * Vehicles, Water Craft Order processing Once a purchase has been initiated by a buyer the system generates an email order which is sent to the supplier. The supplier must then log on to the site and either accept or reject the order. All detailed information needed to process the order is provided including payment information which is usually made with a government issued \\"Smart Pay\\" credit card. Once the item(s) have shipped, the supplier may log on to the site and confirm the order has shipped. The transaction is then complete. No communication with the actual buyer is needed. The simplicity of the transaction is not coincidence but rather by design. The intensive negotiation and approval process standardizes all the variables of a purchase. The variables addressed during the negotiation of each contract include: Discounts, payment terms, shipping costs and methods, warranties, returns, replacements and support. Contracts The initial contract term with a supplier is 5 years with the option of renewal for a total of a 20-year period. Because of the contracts length of time and the potential large purchasing a supplier may receive, the review and approval process is quite intensive. To administer this program GSA maintains a large workforce of negotiators, contract administrators and support representatives. Supplier commitment Winning a GSA advantage contract requires commitment and determination from the supplier. The average time period for a supplier to be accepted and receive a GSA contract is 12–15 months. The lengthy application processing time is not the only challenge a supplier faces. First a considerable amount of resources and time may be required just to get to the application submission stage. Before a supplier can submit an application they must first register and be accepted in the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA) and Central Contractors Registration (CCR) programs. The supplier must also be registered with Dun & Bradstreet and have an Opens Ratings Report generated, for example. The latter is a past- performance evaluation, wherein the supplier's existing customers are contacted and asked to complete an extensive review of the supplier's performance. This report compiles the customer reviews into an overall- performance factor used to evaluate the stability and capabilities of the supplier. All of the above registrations and reports are required before a supplier can even submit a GSA contract application. Qualifications The application itself must follow exact government guidelines but is written in the form of a \\"Best Offer\\" by the supplier. The supplier must detail the services and products they wish to offer, any favorable terms they are offering and details of any preferred customer services they are willing to provide. Process and determination Once all the application materials are submitted the \\"Offer\\" as the government refers to it is assigned to a contract negotiator. The negotiator begins the process by reviewing and assessing the submission paperwork for accuracy and compliance. While the complete process is not public information, it is apparent that the review is extensive and detailed. The contract negotiator addresses each of the following: * The paperwork meets all submission requirements * The supplier is viable and stable * The supplier qualifies to sell products to the government* * The products qualify to be purchased by a federal agency* * The pricing is favorable and better than any other offered by the supplier * The supplier is responsive and the approved products are available for the term of the contract. During this process the negotiator may be in contact with the supplier to clarify details or ask for supporting documents and information. Long periods of time may pass with no communication with the negotiator. If the contract negotiator makes the determination to enter into final negotiations with the supplier, a meeting is scheduled. This is usually conducted over the phone and takes 1–2 hours. The negotiators main focus during the first part of this meeting is to verify all the detailed terms with the supplier and confirm a mutual understanding of the suppliers \\"Offer\\". During this meeting the negotiator may ask for additional discounts or other favorable terms which will benefit the government. Often the supplier is aware this is the last consideration before accepting or rejecting their offer. The negotiator often generates further concessions or savings the supplier is willing to provide but had not yet offered. After the conclusion of this meeting the contract negotiator makes a final decision whether to award the supplier a contract or not. Funding The GSA Advantage program is self- funded. The organization collects an Industrial Funding Fee (IFF) each quarter from the participating suppliers. This fee, calculated at .75% of the total purchasing the program generated for the supplier is collected by the supplier and sent back to the GSA program. Although the supplier is responsible for reporting and paying this self-funding fee, it is the government agencies that actually pay the fee. Suppliers are instructed to add this IFF cost to the total sale price of each order placed by the government. This process is similar in the way many States charge and collect sales tax.

The unit existed from 1984 to 2005. Overview Created in 1984, the First Aid Care Team Program was a cooperative public and private effort bringing together the Chicago Fire Department, Hull House Association, Chicago Housing Authority, University of Chicago Emergency Medical Services and Malcolm X College. It operated as an extension of the City of Chicago's Emergency Medical Services Community, aiding in distinguishing life- threatening medical emergencies and potentially disabling injuries from non- emergency incidents in order to streamline further emergency response. The FACT Program was designed to supplement the Chicago Fire Department's Emergency Medical Services. It had a twofold purpose in providing emergency care, health awareness, and education to the community while also offering educational and employment opportunities to the community's residents. Organization Jane Addams Hull House Association was the first to provide an on-site Medical care team in a Chicago Housing Authority public housing development. There were four stations Fact Team I was in the Robert Taylor Homes, Fact team II was in Stateway Gardens, Fact Team III was in Harold Ickes Homes and Fact Team IV was in the Abla Community. FACT offices were located on the first floors of the high rise buildings. The FACT program was sponsored by the Chicago Fire Department and the Jane Addams Hull House Association and medically supervised by the University of Chicago Hospitals' Department of Emergency Medicine. Emergency response The only program of its kind in the United States, the FACT Program provided pre-hospital Basic Life Support (BLS) and Emergency Medical care 24 hours a day to residents of Chicago's public housing developments. FACT responded to both 9-1-1 emergency calls and to residents who walked into FACT premises for service. Once a resident called 9-1-1 for emergency service, the Office of Emergency Management & Communication (OEMC) simultaneously dispatched an ambulance company and notified personnel at one of the FACT stations via portable radio or dedicated land line (telephone). FACT technicians were generally the first on the scene, arriving within minutes due to their onsite location. Once on the scene, FACT technicians could provide Basic Life Support and attend to everything from trauma to medical emergencies. Program impact In its time running, the First Aid Care Team responded to over 36,333 requests for emergency assistance, of which 9,914 were classified as \\"non-transports\\", cases where FACT technicians provided medical services on-site and no ambulance was dispatched based on the technicians evaluation, thereby reducing the number of \\"no service\\" calls experienced by Chicago Fire Department ambulances. Among residents who served as FACT technicians, 46 are now paramedics with the Chicago Fire Department, 3 are 911 dispatchers with the Office of Emergency Management & Communications, and one person is a Chicago Police Officer.

The decision to adopt new measures originated from questions arising since Resolution 1267 (1999) and subsequent resolutions which imposed travel restrictions, asset freezes and an arms embargo on Osama bin Laden, the Taliban, Al-Qaeda and other associated groups which were placed on a \\"Consolidated List\\" compiled by the Security Council Committee established by Resolution 1267. Details Acting under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, the Council expressed concern at the increase in kidnappings and hostage-takings by individuals or groups for political gain or with the aim of raising funds. It added further measures in addition to those in Resolution 1267 (1999), including Member States to permit the addition to frozen accounts \\"of any payment in favour of listed individuals, groups, undertakings or entities\\", provided that such payments were already subject to earlier measures. The Council made the Sanctions Committee aware of the need for exemptions on humanitarian grounds to be carried out transparently. Resolution 1904 would also increase the efficiency of the \\"Consolidated List\\", by streamlining the listing process of names of individuals and entities onto List, for example, by requesting Member States to provide as much information as possible to the Sanctions Committee. The Council, in Resolution 1904, established an Office of the Ombudsperson for an initial period of 18 months to deal with delisting issues.

The resolution goes on to direct the Sanctions Committee to complete its review of all names on the \\"Consolidated List\\" by 30 June 2010, and to conduct an annual review of all names that had not been reviewed in three or more years. It further required the Committee to conduct a comprehensive review of all pending issues before it and urged the panel to resolve such issues, to the extent possible, by 31 December 2010.

In 1878 the church bought 2.2 acres at its present location and constructed a wood frame structure in 1885. In 1921 the structure was razed and a new church designed in a Gothic vernacular style was built. The church's two front bell towers are typical of the AME faith-based churches of the 1920s. Mount Vernon was the first church to introduce Palestine to integrated low-income apartment housing. In 1968 a 100-unit apartment housing project was erected at 2020 Sterne Avenue. In 1986 the church was designated a Recorded Texas Historic Landmark. In 1988 it was placed on the National Register of Historic Places. The church closed its doors in 2014.

Robinson was the first employee of Scientific Atlanta, where he remained CEO then Chairman of the company until he retired. Initially a ham radio enthusiast and subsequently a graduate of the Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech) with both bachelor's and master's degrees in physics, Robinson worked at the Georgia Tech Research Institute and the Oak Ridge National Laboratory before founding Scientific Atlanta. Later in life, he founded and invested in numerous Atlanta-based science-related companies. Robinson was named an IEEE Fellow and held at least 39 patents in fields including solar energy devices and antenna systems. For his contributions, he was named Georgia's Small Businessman of the Year in 1965, the Georgia Business and Industry Association's Entrepreneur of the Year in 1981, and was elected to the Georgia Technology Hall of Fame in 1993. In 2003, Georgia Tech awarded him an honorary Ph.D. in Physics, and in 2007, half of Georgia Tech's Molecular Science and Engineering Building was named the Glen P. Robinson, Jr. Tower in his honor. Early life and education Robinson was born on September 10, 1923, in Crescent City, Florida, an outskirt of Jacksonville, to Glen Parmelee and Laura Mae (Lewis) Robinson. His family moved to Valdosta, Georgia, in 1937. After attending high school at Marion Military Institute in Alabama, Robinson opened a small machine shop in Valdosta. He sold industrial products and metal tools to local industry. In 1942, with the encouragement of his father, Robinson enrolled as a student at the Georgia Institute of Technology to study chemical engineering. However, his education was interrupted by his enlistment into the Naval Signal Corps and service in the Pacific Theatre of World War II where he installed telephones on recaptured American possessions during the war. Robinson returned from the conflict as a junior and in 1948 he changed his major to physics, as the School of Physics started its degree program that year. He received a Bachelor of Science in Physics in 1948, and a Master of Science in Physics (also from Georgia Tech) in 1950. Robinson was also a member of Georgia Tech's prestigious secret society, ANAK. Robinson had been a ham radio operator enthusiast since the age of 14, and started a radio repair service to provide additional income while he was a student at Georgia Tech. One of Robinson's professors, James E. Boyd, convinced him to give up the radio repair business and work as a research assistant at the Georgia Tech Research Institute (then known as the Engineering Experiment Station, or EES). One of his ham radio friends was actually his boss's boss and EES director, Gerald Rosselot. Working after hours at EES, Robinson built a television set in the lab, which he and others claim was the first to be built in the state of Georgia. In 1950, Robinson went to Tennessee to work in nuclear engineering for Oak Ridge National Laboratory, servicing radiology-related equipment at local hospitals. Scientific Atlanta Robinson and six other Georgia Tech researchers (including Robinson's former professor James E. Boyd and EES director Gerald Rosselot) each contributed $100 (for a total of $700) and founded Scientific Associates on October 31, 1951, with the initial goal of marketing antenna structures being developed by the radar branch of the EES to the U.S. military. Robinson worked as the unpaid general manager for the first year. The relations between Scientific Associates and the EES were initially strained due to an unrelated dispute over station finances between EES director Gerald Rosselot and Georgia Tech vice president Cherry Emerson. Specifically, Emerson believed that surplus funds realized through research contracts should be returned to Georgia Tech, while the Georgia Tech Research Corporation and Rosselot felt they should be retained to foster additional research. A strict conflict of interest policy was enacted, and researchers were forced to choose between the two entities; the initial investors had all kept their faculty jobs, and most returned to them. After the fledgling company's first contract resulted in a $4,000 loss, Robinson bought out all but one of the original investors and paid them each back their original $100. Robinson left EES and became president and CEO of the new company, which was renamed Scientific Atlanta. Boyd stayed on as a member of the board of directors; Robinson's friend Larry Clayton, previously involved in Robinson's radio business and now having graduated from Georgia Tech with a degree in physics, became the head of the new company's research and development. Years later, the school would promote Scientific Atlanta's origins at Georgia Tech, and Scientific Atlanta has been a longtime financial contributor to Georgia Tech. Scientific Atlanta's first business focus was antennas for military and industrial use. Finances were tight at the fledgling firm. When they could not afford an automatic antenna pattern recorder, of which there was only one such machine on the market, Robinson decided to build his own. When word in the industry spread companies began contacting Scientific Atlanta. Within six months of the development of the device, Robinson sold units to Western Electric, Westinghouse Electric Corporation, General Electric, Convair, American Machine and Foundry, and many other large corporations of the era. Within eight years of operating, the firm had captured 60% of the global market share of electronic instruments for testing and designing antennas, had broken ground on a 25-acre facility in Northeast Atlanta, and had 240 employees on the payroll including 40 engineers. Scientific Atlanta helped NASA establish ground stations for communication with astronauts during the Mercury, Gemini and Apollo projects. When John Glenn became the first American to orbit the Earth in 1962 on Mercury-Atlas 6, his voice was transmitted and received by radio antennas designed and equipment built by Scientific Atlanta. In the 1970s, Robinson recognized the potential combination of communications satellites and cable television. Ted Turner purchased one of Scientific Atlanta's first satellite systems, which formed the basis of Turner's \\"Super Station\\" that was broadcast around the country to other cable providers. In 1975, HBO and TelePrompTer used Scientific Atlanta equipment to transmit the first live satellite-delivered cable event, the \\"Thrilla in Manila\\" heavyweight boxing championship bout between Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier. Scientific Atlanta is perhaps best known for pioneering television cable set- top boxes and equipment worldwide and the development of satellite Earth stations. Robinson remained CEO of Scientific Atlanta for 20 years, and chairman of the board for an additional eight years, until he retired from the company in 1979. Scientific Atlanta grew dramatically; it earned $3.1 million in revenue in 1962, approximately $200 million in 1979, and $1.9 billion in yearly revenue by 2005. Scientific Atlanta served as a regional business incubator, with hundreds of companies tracing their roots back to it. Later career Robinson founded E-Tech in 1978, which developed heat pump technology and high-technology related to energy conservation, energy conversion, and solar energy. When interviewed about E-Tech's founding, Robinson said \\"I like to pioneer new fields, to start small businesses.\\" E-Tech acquired Scientific Atlanta's Special Products Division, which included staff, research contracts, patented products in solar energy, and specialized equipment. Its first product was an electric heat pump water heater, the Efficiency II, that reduced water heating bills by 50% and provided an equipment payback of three years. E-Tech worked on a range of United States Department of Energy contracts in the field of solar energy. In 1986, E-Tech merged with Crispaire Corporation, which specialized in cooling equipment for telecommunications systems, school classrooms, and commercial/industrial structures. The merger resulted in Robinson taking over the new entity, which also operated under the trade name Marvair. Crispaire Corporation/Marvair later joined with RV Products to form a new company, Airxcel, Inc. Robinson retired from this venture in 1997. In 1994, Robinson funded and co-founded LaserCraft, which focused on applications of LIDAR such as radar guns and traffic enforcement cameras, and in 2006 was the world's largest manufacturer of laser products for law enforcement. LaserCraft was acquired by Public Safety Equipment in June 2006, which was in turn acquired by Stirling Square Capital Partners and Diamond Castle Holdings in February 2007. Robinson was an angel investor, particularly in the fields of digital communications and biotechnology. In 1999, he funded OmniMetrix and Mission Communications, two companies focused on AMPS cellular digital control channel and wireless SCADA communications. Omnimetrix was acquired by Acorn Energy in 2012. Mission is currently the leading provider of cellular SCADA for water and wastewater in North America. In 2000, he invested $1.5 million in Genomic Solutions Inc, which was acquired by Digilab, Inc. in 2007. Most recently, Robinson was an investor in and co- founder of the 2007 VentureLab startup, C2 Biofuels, which attracted additional funding from Chevron and aims to build several $100 million cellulosic ethanol plants throughout the United States. Legacy Robinson held positions on numerous boards, including: Chairman of the Georgia Science and Technology Commission; Chairman of the Georgia Tech Research Corporation; Trustee of The Georgia Tech Foundation; Member of the Board of Visitors of Emory University; Director of the Atlanta Chamber of Commerce; Director of the Georgia Tech Alumni Association, advisory board of the Georgia Institute of Technology College of Engineering, board member of Georgia State's School of Business, and director of the Georgia Business and Industry Association. Robinson was a member of the Defense Science Board, an advisory committee of the United States Department of Defense on scientific and technical matters. He was a presenting member of the White House Conference on the Industrial World Ahead, a meeting of the nation's top business leaders to discuss technological advancement, social change, manpower utilization, Cold War competition and the state of American enterprise. Arranged by Richard Nixon and Secretary of Commerce Maurice Stans, it was the first such meeting ever held that focused solely on American business and the future. Robinson was elected an IEEE Fellow in 1977 and given the award of Outstanding Engineer of Region III by IEEE in 1978. Robinson was selected as Georgia's Small Businessman of the Year in 1965, the Georgia Business and Industry Association's (now the Georgia Chamber of Commerce) Entrepreneur of the Year in 1981, and was elected to the Georgia Technology Hall of Fame in 1993. Since 1995, Scientific Atlanta has sponsored scholarships in Robinson's name for children of its employees. In March 1998, Robinson donated to create two endowed chairs at Georgia Tech: the $1.5 million Glen P. Robinson Chair in Non-Linear Science (in the School of Physics), currently held by Predrag Cvitanović, and the $1.5 million Glen P. Robinson Chair in Electro-Optics (in GTRI). In 2003, Georgia Tech awarded him an honorary Ph.D. in physics, and in 2006 he was awarded the Joseph Mayo Pettit Alumni Distinguished Service Award. In 2007, half of Georgia Tech's Molecular Science and Engineering Building was named the Glen P. Robinson, Jr. Tower in his honor, due in part to his $5 million donation towards its construction. Robinson continued working with startups and technology businesses throughout his later career. Near the end of his life, he and his wife, Jan Musgrove Robinson, had 5 children, 12 grandchildren, and 3 great-grandchildren and lived in Atlanta. On Wednesday, January 16, 2013, Robinson died of apparent heart failure. The funeral was held at St. Anne's Episcopal Church in Atlanta, and he was cremated by H.M. Patterson & Son, Arlington Chapel.

An architectural design competition was held, and the Romanesque Revival-style design of architect Alonzo N. Dawson of Fort Worth was chosen out of 25 submissions. The contract amount for construction was $32,500. The exterior walls of the courthouse are of brown sandstone obtained from a nearby quarry. Originally, the building was two-story and rising from the center of the courthouse was a massive octagonal tower, with four clock faces, terminated with a cupola. The tower was removed in 1928 and a third floor was added. The jail, a block north of the courthouse, was built in 1910. The courthouse and jail were added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1977.

It was founded in 1856 by a group of scientists and businessmen in St. Louis, including George Engelmann and James B. Eads, the Academy has been involved in many science- related activities in the city. It ran a Museum of Science and Natural History in Clayton, Missouri, and was involved in the efforts to raise funding for the St. Louis Science Center. The Academy uses its resources to expand scientific outreach, education, resource sharing, and the recognition of scientific accomplishment. Academy history In the 1830s, a Western Academy of Natural Sciences in St. Louis was founded, as a counterpart to the Eastern Academy of Natural Sciences. Its goals were altruistic, to explore the West and discover natural resources. In 1856, the Academy reorganized into the Academy of Science of St. Louis, holding its first meeting on March 10, 1856 and was founded by twelve physicians, a lawyer, an engineer and a businessman, for the advancement of science in what was then the rapidly growing town of St. Louis, Missouri. The Academy's mission was to promote \\"Zoology, Botany, Geology, Mineralogy, Paleontology, Ethnology, Chemistry, Physics, Mathematics, Meteorology, Comparative Anatomy, and Physiology.\\" Academy members started a museum collection, maintained a library, published a journal and corresponded with leading scientists of the day, providing information concerning the lands that lay adjacent and to the west of St. Louis. Founders Charles P. Chouteau (1819 - 1884) Dr. George Engelmann, a physician and the Academy's first president and a prominent amateur botanist, helped plan the renowned Missouri Botanical Garden. Frederick Adolphus Wislezenus, a doctor and an accomplished observer of Western natural history, helped found the Missouri Historical Society. Karl Andreas Geyer, a naturalist, was also a strong influence on the organization. Ten other physicians included: Benjamin Shumard, who assisted in Missouri's first exhaustive geological survey; Simon Pollak, who helped found the Missouri School for the Blind; Moses Linton, a St. Louis University Medical School teacher, who first published the St. Louis Medical and Surgical Journal; William M. McPheeters (1815-1905), a St. Louis Medical College and Missouri Medical College teacher; Moses M. Pallen, a St. Louis University teacher who served as St. Louis' health officer; Charles A. Pope, a St. Louis Medical College Dean, who allowed Academy members to meet and house their collections and library in one of the college's buildings; Hiram A. Prout, who came to teach medicine and became an expert paleontologist; Charles W. Stevens, a St. Louis Medical College teacher, who became superintendent of the St. Louis County Insane Asylum; W. H. Tingley, a physician; and John H. Watters, a St. Louis Medical College and Missouri Medical College teacher. The other founders included: James B. Eads, a self- taught engineer, who built the Eads Bridge over the Mississippi River; attorney Nathaniel Holmes, who acquired numerous publications from other science societies for the Academy; and Charles P. Chouteau, owner of the American Fur Trading Co., who studied the region's natural history and contributed to the museum's collections. The Scientific Collection Early members of the Academy collected natural history specimens for their society. These items were stored and made available to the public in various museums throughout the Academy's history. Choteau and Wislizenus accumulated botanical, zoological and geological specimens from the vast and little-known regions of the American West. In later years, collectors such as Henry M. Whelpey (Native American artifacts) and Stratford Lee Morton (minerals, sea shells and fossils) donated their collections to the Academy. Famous journal For many years, the Academy published one of the world's most respected scientific journals, Transactions of the Academy of Science of St. Louis. Scientific societies of the eastern United States and in Europe were eager to receive copies of Transactions, which contained papers on the natural history and geology of the American West. Outstanding scientist and Academy member African-American Charles Henry Turner, a devoted entomologist, published over 50 papers on subjects in neurology, invertebrate ecology and animal behavior in the Academy's world-renowned Transactions. Science literacy Throughout its history, the Academy has promoted important scientific work and continues to be a staunch supporter of mathematics and science education. Academy-sponsored lectures, exhibits and television productions have been an important part of the St. Louis area's educational scene. Thousands of children participated in informal science classes at the Academy's museum of Science and Natural History in Oak Knoll Park in Clayton, Missouri. The Academy also helped lead the campaign to build the internationally recognized Saint Louis Science Center. The Academy is actively involved in promoting science and increasing science literacy among students and the general public. More than 600 professional scientists have volunteered through the Academy to speak at elementary and secondary schools, universities, civic and youth organizations and other community groups. Many also serve as mentors for the over 450 students who are members of the Junior Academy of Science of St. Louis, for students in the sixth through twelfth grades in the St. Louis Area.

Biography  Forbes Cowan began his strongman career in 1990 with a win in his inaugural competition as Cunninghame's Strongest Man in May 1990. Having repeated this feat in 1991 he quickly moved into the professional circuit and won Scotland's Strongest Man, the first of six such titles. In 1991, the meteoric career led him to become Europe's Strongest Man, a title he held with World's Strongest Man winner Gary Taylor. In 1993 he won the British Muscle Power Championship and Britain's Strongest Man and was selected as the competition tester and British reserve for the 1993 World's Strongest Man competition in Orange, France. Forbes Cowan came fourth in the World Muscle Power championship of 1993 and 1994, and in 1995 progressed to second spot, winning this prestigious title in 1996. He took the European Muscle Power title in 1995 in a field that included the great Magnus Ver Magnusson. Four years into his professional career he was invited to his first World's Strongest Man in 1994 in South Africa where he created a sensation when he won his heat against tough opposition, including the then current title holder Gary Taylor. In the final, he beat the eventual champion Magnus Ver Magnusson in the pole push but sustained a rib injury. He continued through the pain to finish fifth overall. He repeated this finish in 1995, again after sustaining an injury, this time to his back. His career peaked in 1996, when he won the World Muscle Power title. His career was put on hold in 1997 when he was imprisoned for his involvement in a plot to smuggle cannabis into the UK. Following his release in 2001, he continued to compete but not at the very top international flight. In addition to strength athletics he was also a renowned Highland Games competitor excelling in caber tossing and throwing 56 lb in weight for height.

Information Nemacheilus masyai or the \\"arrow loach\\", can be found in a freshwater environment within a benthopelagic depth habitat. They are native to a tropical climate. The average length of the Nemacheilus masya as an unsexed male is about 13.5 centimeters or about 5.3 inches. The body of this species is a light colour with dark splotches that can be found on its side. It can be identified by its elongated slim body. The arrow loach is known to be found in the areas of Asia, western Malaysia, Peninsular Thailand, the Meklong, part of the Mae Nam Chao Phraya basins, and the Mekong Basin. It is known to occur in shallow forest rivers and steams. They prefer a slow current of clear to slightly turbid water, with a muddy or sandy bottom. As far as their diet goes, this species feeds on insects, larvae, and invertebrate that live in the water. The females of this species are somewhat larger and of a bigger stature than the males are. The specific name honours Thai science illustrator Luang Masya Chitrakarn, fisheries scholar, one of the pioneers of fisheries in Thailand. Aquarium The Nemacheilus masyai has the ability to be an aquarium fish and is used for commercial use. It is considered to be an easily maintained fish. A tank size that is about 30 by 60 centimeters is the minimum size that is recommended for this species. The temperature should be about 23 - 26 degrees Celsius, or 68 to 72 degrees Fahrenheit. The diet of the Nemacheilus masyai consists of frozen food like Daphnia, Artemia, and bloodworm that will result in the best colouration and condition.

A leading citizen of Miami, Florida in the early 20th century, Burdine was the son of William Burdine, who founded Burdines as a dry goods store in 1898. After his father's death, Burdine became the chairman of the department store, leading its expansion to become one of the biggest department stores in the United States. He built Miami's first skyscraper and created the first parking garage connected to a retail business. Biography=Early life Burdine was born in Verona, Mississippi, the third of seven children. He was the son of William Burdine, a Confederate veteran and merchant and Mary Freeman. At a young age, the Burdine family moved to Bartow, Florida where his father became a successful orange grower. William Burdine moved his family to Miami when Roddy was 10 after a great freeze destroyed the family's crop. Retail career Miami was incorporated as a city in 1896. The Spanish–American War was raging, and many soldiers were training in the area when William Burdine founded a dry goods store to cater the needs of these soldiers two years later in 1898. Roddy worked at the store as a teenager, first as a clerk, and after graduating from Miami High School became a partner with his brother, Robert Freeman Burdine, a successful Miami attorney. Upon his father’s death in 1911, Roddy became the owner of the company. Soon afterwards, Roddy led the expansion of Burdines. In 1912, Roddy built a new store on Flagler Street, the main commercial street in Miami. Five stories high, the Burdine Building became Miami's first \\"skyscraper\\", and the first building to have modern electrical installation. Burdine traveled north to study department stores such as Wanamaker's and Marshall Field's to make his department store the most modern in the country. By 1924, Burdines had become the leading department store in Florida, with customers coming from across the state. It had its own post office, restaurant, and car dealership. A new parking garage opened in 1923, becoming the first garage linked to a retail establishment. A new six- story building with opened next to its original location in 1925. His second store opened in Miami Beach also in 1925. Civic activity Burdine was the head of the Miami's Rotary Club, and the head of the business ethics committee. After the Great Miami Hurricane of 1926, Burdine was named the head of the rebuilding committee. In 1933, Roddy Burdine Municipal Stadium opened in what would, many decades later, become the \\"Little Havana\\" section of Miami. In 1959, it was renamed as the Orange Bowl.

They had two daughters, Zada (November 18, 1916 – September 18, 2016) and Patricia (December 29, 1919 – July 13, 1986), and divorced in 1932. Roddy remarried on September 14, 1933 to Lillian Jenette Chatham (September 1, 1903 – May 17, 2006), a native of Windom, Minnesota, in New York City.

After the election, the composition of the council was *Liberal Democrat 29 *Conservative 26 *Independent 2 Campaign The Conservatives had gained control of Winchester council in the 2006 election after a sex scandal involving the local Liberal Democrat MP Mark Oaten. Going into the 2010 election the Conservatives had a majority of just 1 seat and were defending 13 seats compared to 4 for the Liberal Democrats, due to the seats they won in 2006 being due for election in 2010. Several councillors stood down at the election, including George Hollingbery from The Alresfords ward to contest the Meon Valley constituency in the general election, Fred Allgood from Denmead ward, Georgina Busher from Bishop's Waltham and James Stephens from St Luke ward. Brian Collin also did not defend his Olivers Battery and Badger Farm ward, which he had held for 24 years, to contest St John and All Saints instead. The Conservatives defended their record on the council pointing to a repaving of the high street, park and ride projects and keeping council tax increases below inflation. However the Liberal Democrats accused the Conservatives of running down reserves that the Liberal Democrats had built up when they were in power and were confident of taking control in particular with the election taking place at the same time as the general election. The Labour party were defending their last seat on the council in St John and All Saints ward with predictions that Labour could be without representation on the council for the first time. Meanwhile, the Green party only contested one seat in St Bartholomew in order to concentrate their efforts and campaigned on development issues. Election result The results saw the Liberal Democrats take control over the council after gaining 5 seats to hold 29 of the 57 seats. This gave them an overall majority of 1 seat, despite the Conservatives winning 10 seats at the election compared to 9 for the Liberal Democrats. The Conservatives did make one gain, taking a former independent seat where the councillor Georgina Busher stood down at the election.

Its campus at Monroe and Colorado Streets includes its historic parish church as well as a sacristy, preschool, and parish hall. The community was first established on August 18, 1855 as Trinity Parish, with the Rev. Hanibal Pratt as minister. Around 1860 the name was changed to Saint James. Many congregants succumbed to a yellow fever epidemic in 1867, and the community suffered major floods in 1869 and 1870. Nevertheless, it continued to grow, meeting in an old school building it eventually outgrew. The Rev. W.G.W. Smith arrived in 1876, after the Reconstruction Era, and became its first full-time rector in 1881. Influenced by the Oxford Movement, he retained noted Gothic Revival architect Richard M. Upjohn in 1883 to design the current structure. After a period of fundraising, the cornerstone for the present building was laid on February 5, 1885, on land bequeathed for that purpose by prominent local residents Benjamin and Georgiana Shropshire in 1868. The church was formally consecrated on February 28, 1886.  Church A Stick style wooden structure (transitional between Carpenter Gothic and Queen Anne, and thus sometimes described as either), the church was built by Carl Michaelis, a local contractor. The dark red, ivory, and brown exterior is dominated by a large bell tower, with the tower bell struck by the Meneely Bell Foundry of West Troy, New York and installed in 1892. The exterior walls are shingled on the first story with half-timber decor on the second level. The interior features exposed columns and trusses of local yellow pine, with white plastered walls and ceilings. Its stained glass windows are noted, but the artist or artists are uncertain; the parish speculates that English artist Charles Booth may have designed the elaborate Shropshire memorial, but that other pieces may have been ordered from catalogues. Rev. Smith is believed to have designed and built the altar, lectern, communion rail, and Bishop's chair, all of which remain in current use. Smith also designed the pews, built locally by the shop of Frank Reichert, and which also remain in current use. The church was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1976.

Glen Sobel is an American drummer who has performed and recorded in many different genres. Mainly known for being the drummer for Alice Cooper since 2011, Sobel has worked with other musicians/groups, including Mötley Crüe, Hollywood Vampires (band), Richie Sambora, Orianthi, Beautiful Creatures, Chris Impellitteri, Gary Hoey, Tony MacAlpine, Jennifer Batten, Paul Gilbert, Saga and Shark Island. As a member of the house band at various events from 2011 to present, Sobel played behind such varied artists as Steven Tyler, Joe Perry, Sammy Hagar, Johnny Depp, Jim Carrey, Rob Halford, \\"Weird\\" Al Yankovic, Mike Myers, Sarah McLachlan, Michael McDonald, Robbie Krieger, Kesha, Arthur Brown and others. Biography A native of Los Angeles, Sobel began playing drums at the age of eleven. He studied drums throughout high school whilst playing in marching bands, jazz bands and other bands outside of school, ultimately winning a large drum-off competition in Los Angeles at the age of 19. This soon led to his first pro gig playing for guitar virtuoso Tony MacAlpine. Sobel recorded one record with MacAlpine in 1993, entitled Madness, which featured jazz saxophone luminary Branford Marsalis. Switching musical gears, Sobel took gigs with SX-10, a rap/rock hybrid band with Sen Dog of Cypress Hill which featured many other rap luminaries of the day such as Everlast and Kottonmouth Kings. Soon after, Sobel accepted an offer to become a band member of Warner Bros. Records artists Beautiful Creatures whose line- up also featured Joe Leste of Bang Tango and DJ Ashba of Sixx: A.M. and Guns N' Roses. Beautiful Creatures participated in several tours in 2001 including Ozzfest, opening for Marilyn Manson and others. The next few years saw Sobel playing on a number of tours and recording jobs including playing on the new version of \\"Heavy Action\\" (the Monday Night Football theme on ESPN) and touring with American Idol second runner up Elliott Yamin who scored a top ten smash in 2007. Teaching jobs also followed with a faculty position in the drum department at Musician's Institute in Hollywood, which led to appearing and performing at various drum clinics and festivals in several countries such as Drum Daze in Columbus, Ohio, the Laguna Drum Festival in Mexico and various clinics throughout Asia and Europe. In September 2010, Sobel got a last minute call to sub for an injured Matt Laug on the Vasco Rossi 2010 Indoor Tour of Italy. The tour saw crowds in excess of 40,000 people and Sobel filled in for five weeks. In October 2015 during Mötley Crüe's farewell tour, Sobel filled in for Tommy Lee, who was unable to perform due to tendinitis in his wrist. Sobel played drums in both Alice Cooper and Mötley Crüe for 5 consecutive shows while Lee was recovering from his injury. On January 21, 2017, Sobel performed with the Hollywood Vampires at the TEC Awards that honored Joe Perry with the Les Paul Award. When not on the road, Sobel plays around Los Angeles with various artists including Def Leppard guitarist Vivian Campbell's band, Sir Sodoff and the Trainwrecks. Equipment Sobel plays DW drums, pedals, and hardware, Evans drumheads, Sabian cymbals, Vater drumsticks, and Meinl Percussion.

History Old St. Mary's Church (1863) in 2017 Old St. Mary's The first Catholic church in Fredericksburg was a log house built in 1848. In 1861 it was replaced by a stone building, completed in 1863. Now called Old St. Mary's, since 1906 this building has served several purposes, including as a schoolhouse. Its place in the history of German immigration to Texas lead it to be listed as a Recorded Texas Historic Landmark in 1994. St. Mary's today By 1901 the church building was too small for the congregation. A new church was designed by San Antonio architect Leo M.J. Dielmann and built by contractor Jacob Wagner in 1906. The current St. Mary's contains many Gothic features such as buttresses, trefoil motifs, and a corner tower rising high above the roofline. The interior contains extensive painting and murals, including on the organ pipes and ceiling vaults, leading to its inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places as a painted church. It is also part of the National Register's Fredericksburg Historic District, and a Recorded Texas Historic Landmark. The current campus also includes Our Lady of Guadalupe Catholic Church at 302 East College Street. Originally opened in 1919, it was closed in the 1940s, then reopened as a mission of St. Mary's for Spanish speakers in 1983.

Ludwig Wenzel Lachnith (Prague, July 7, 1746 – Paris, October 3, 1820)(Slonimsky 1958), was a Bohemian horn player and versatile composer influenced by Joseph Haydn and Ignaz Pleyel. Today he is chiefly remembered because of his adaptions of operas by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. The French composer and writer Hector Berlioz immortalized him in a diatribe in his autobiography. Biography Zweibrücken Castle (modern view) Lachnith was born in Prague. After early studies with his father Franz, an able church musician in Prague, Lachnith from 1768 onwards became a member of the court orchestra in Zweibrücken.Biographical Article \\"Lachnith\\" in: Österreichisches Biographisches Lexikon, 1815–1950 (in German). In 1773 he went to Paris to study French horn with Johann Josef Rudolf (Rodolphe) and later composition with François-André Danican Philidor.Biographical Article \\"Lachnith\\" in: Oesterreichisches Musiklexikon ONLINE (in German). Since 1783 he was living permanently in Paris, where his symphonies were played in the Concerts de la Reine (i. e. Marie Antoinette). With the onset of the French Revolution he got in trouble with the new authorities and had to resign from his post at the Paris Opera. He fled from the terror of the revolution in 1790, came back and henceforth eked out a meagre existence by giving private lessons and arranging operas and even oratorios for Parisian theatres. In 1801 he became instructor at the Paris Opera, but had to leave the following year, only to be reemployed in 1806. He died in Paris. He is remembered chiefly as a composer of pasticcios, using the music of several composers in one piece. His arrangement of the music and libretto of Mozart's Magic Flute (Die Zauberflöte), appearing under the title Les Mystères d'Isis in 1801, was an instant success but also parodied as Les Misères d'ici. In several of his ventures he had Christian Kalkbrenner, father of the pianist and composer Friedrich Kalkbrenner, as his collaborator. Lachnith’s adaption of Mozart’s Magic Flute – critique=Hector Berlioz Eminent French composer and outspoken music critic Hector Berlioz (ca. 1865The picture was taken between summer 1864 and July 1865 by François Gobinet (1816-1906)). Although very successful with the public, Lachnith's adaption of Mozart’s Magic Flute met with scathing criticism already during his lifetime. Hector Berlioz for one was a fierce (and very funny) critic of such practices.Berlioz devoted the entire chapter XV of his autobiography to opera adaptations. Together with the name of Castil-Blaze, another one of the usual suspects when it came to opera travesties, Berlioz singled Lachnith's name out already in the contents section of his autobiography. He must have really intended to shame him in order to condemn him to eternal derision by posterity. Long before the terms Urtext (original text) and Werktreue (work faithfulness) were coined, Berlioz was demanding just that in a series of articles that were later incorporated into his autobiography: :\\"It was some years before this that, in order to ensure the success of Mozart's Magic Flute, the manager of the Opéra produced that marvellous travesty of it, Les Mystères d'Isis, the libretto of which is a mystery as yet unveiled by no one. When he had manipulated the text to his liking, our intelligent manager sent for a German composer to help him patch up the music. The German proved equal to the occasion. He stuck a few bars on the end of the overture (the overture of the Magic Flute!), turned part of a soprano chorus into a bass song, adding a few bars of his own; transplanted the wind instruments from one scene to another; changed the air and altered the instrumentation of the accompaniment in Sarastro's glorious song ; manufactured a song out of the slaves' chorus, O cara armonia; and converted a duet into a trio. Not satisfied with the Magic Flute, this cormorant must next lay hands on Titus and Don Juan. The song, Quel charme a mes esprits rappelle, is taken from Titus, but only the andante is there, for the allegro, with which it ends, does not seem to have pleased our uomo capace; so he decreed a violent divorce, and, in its stead, put in a patchwork of his own, interspersed with scraps of Mozart. No one would dream of the base uses to which our friend put the celebrated Fin ch’han dal vino, that vivid outburst of libertinism in which Don Juan's whole character is epitomised. He turned it into a trio for a bass and two sopranos, with the following sweetly sentimental lines […].\\" :\\"When this wretched hotchpotch was ready it was dubbed Les Mystères d'Isis, was played in that form, and printed and published in full score with the name of that profane idiot Lachnith (which I publish that it may be perpetuated with that of Castil-Blaze) actually bracketed with Mozart's on the title-page. In this wise, two beggars in filthy rags came masquerading before the public in the rich robes of the kings of harmony; and, in this sordid fashion, two men of genius, disguised as monkeys, decked in flimsy tinsel, mutilated and deformed, were presented to the French people, by their tormentors, as Mozart and Weber! And the public was deceived, for no one came forward to punish the miscreants or give them the lie. Alas! how little the public recks of such crimes, even when it is cognizant of them! In Germany and England, as well as in France, such adaptation (which means profanation and spoliation) of masterpieces by the veriest (sic) nobodies is tolerated.\\"Berlioz 1884, pp. 83–85. Otto Jahn Otto Jahn For Mozart's biographer Otto Jahn Lachnith's travesty was the \\"maddest chapter in the history of the Magic Flute\\": : \\"The maddest chapter in the history of the Magic Flute, however, was the Parisian performance in 1801 through Lachnith under the title Les Mystères d’Isis. This native Bohemian had the tastelessness to extirpate all that was wonderful and comic, thereby transforming Papageno into a shepherd named Bochoris. No work of art has ever been treated more impiously. Whole scenes (12, 17, 18, 19) were omitted and in their stead pieces from other Operas by Mozart inserted such as the Champagne Aria from Don Juan and an aria from Titus (both rendered into duets!). Also the music itself was through readjustment and changes mistreated. Thus, the opera started with the final chorus and Sarastro’s recitative. This was followed by trio Nr. 16 sung by six priestesses which in turn was followed by a chorus from Titus, and only then came the original introduction. Monostatos' aria was sung by Papagena (renamed Mona), the first aria of the Queen of the Night was sung by Pamina, and the duet (7) became a trio.\\" : \\"Even the Parisians thought this too much and spoke of Les Misères d'ici and of the opération of the dérangeur (sic) Lachnith. Yet in spite of all this criticism, Lachnith had managed to hit the French taste exquisitely well; the splendid ballets and decoration and the decor in general received unanimous praise as did orchestra and choir. In this way this distortion saw a full 130 performances until 1827. Only in the year 1865 was The Magic Flute finally performed in its original form at the Théâtre Lyrique.\\"Jahn 1923, p. 838 f. German original: \\"Das tollste Kapitel in ihrer Geschichte bildet die Pariser Aufführung von 1801 durch Lachnith unter dem Titel Les mystères d'Isis. Dieser geborene Böhme hatte die Geschmacklosigkeit, alles Wunderbare und Komische auszumerzen und z. B. Papageno in einen weisen Schäfer namens Bochoris zu verwandeln. Pietätloser ist wohl noch nie mit einem Kunstwerk verfahren worden. Ganze Nummern (12, 17, 18, 19) blieben weg, dafür wurden Stücke aus andern Mozartschen Opern eingelegt, wie z.B. die Champagnerarie aus Don Giovanni und eine Arie aus Titus (beide zu Duetten verarbeitet!). Auch die Musikstücke selbst wurden durch Umstellung und Abänderung mißhandelt. So begann die Oper mit dem Schlußchor und Sarastros Rezitativ. Dann folgte, von sechs Priesterinnen gesungen, das Terzett Nr. 16, hierauf ein Chor aus Titus (15) und nun erst die ursprüngliche Introduktion. Monostatos' Arie fiel Papagena (Mona) zu, die erste Arie der Königin der Pamina, das Duett (7) wurde zum Terzett. Das war auch den Parisern zu arg, man sprach von misères d'ici und von der opération des dérangeur Lachnith. Aber trotz allen Einsprüchen hatte dieser den französischen Geschmack nach einer anderen Seite hin ausgezeichnet getroffen. Denn allgemein lobte man die glänzenden Ballette und Dekorationen, überhaupt die ganze äußere Ausstattung und die treffliche Aufführung durch Orchester und Chor, und so erlebte dieses Zerrbild bis 1827 volle 130 Aufführungen. Erst am 21. Febr. 1865 ging das Werk in seiner Urgestalt, bearbeitet von Nuitter und Beaumont, auf dem Théatre lyrique in Szene und hatte einen glänzenden Erfolg.\\" Works (selection)=Operas Original compositions by Lachnith include the operas: * L'Heureuse Reconciliation (1785) * L'Antiquaire (1789) *Eugenie et Linval (1798). Oratorios *Saul (1805) * Battle of Jericho (together with Christian Kalkbrenner, 1805). Orchestral music * 24 symphonies * 3 concertos for French horn and orchestra Chamber music * 12 string quartets * 6 piano trios * 30 sonatas for piano and violinThis is the correct designation and word order, not the other way round. For up until the mid 19th century what we call today sonatas for violin and piano were usually called piano sonatas with accompaniment of the violin.

The plot is set during the Cold War and combines both documentary and fictional elements. The protagonist is a fictionalised version of Alfred Hitchcock. The backdrop of the film charts the rise of the television in the domestic setting and with it, the ensuing commodification of fear during the cold war. Double Take is a Belgian-Dutch-German co-production and premiered in Europe at the 2009 Berlin Film Festival and in the U.S. at the 2010 Sundance film Festival.  Plot  Inspired by Jorge Luis Borges' short story 25th August, 1983, Double Take's narrative plot is based on a fictional encounter Alfred Hitchcock has with an older version of himself. Whilst on set of his 1962 film The Birds, Hitchcock calls a twelve-minute break in order to answer a phone call in one of the universal studio buildings. After a foreboding encounter with a security guard, Hitchcock finds his way into a room similar to the tearooms in both the Chasen's hotel in Los Angeles and the Claridge's hotel in London. Here, Hitchcock and his doppelgänger meet. The ensuing conversation between the two is characterized by personal paranoia and distrust where the younger Hitchcock is in deep fear of his older alter ego. Intermittently returning to the room in which the menacing conversation between the two Hitchcocks proceeds, the narrative takes a deathward path. Hitchcock and his doppelgänger regard each other with a mixture of revulsion and confusion. Regarding the aphorism that \\"if you meet your double, you should kill him\\", both Hitchcocks knowing how the encounter must end.\\"So, tell me, how would you like to die?\\" asks the older Hitchcock, sipping on a cup of coffee. All the while, Folgers coffee advertisements puncture the narration in the backdrop of the Cold War. By means of his double, Hitchcock the filmmaker realizes that he is going to die. Killed by the younger, television-making, version of himself. Cast * Ron Burrage as Hitchcock's Double. \\"For years, Ron impersonated Hitchcock in everything ranging from Robert Lepage's Le Confessional (1995) (itself a remake), to soap and shampoo commercials, to guest appearances in music videos for Oasis, to introducing Hitchcock Presents on Italian television, to starring in a Japanese documentary about the life of the Master...\\" However, Burrage shares much more with the real Alfred Hitchcock than his looks; from Hitchcock's pranks to his birthday (13 August). He is not only filling in for Hitchcock but literally taking over his role by introducing Tippi Hedren to the audience after the first screening of the newly restored print of The Birds in Locarno, that actually took place on 13 August. * Mark Perry as Hitchcock's Voice * Delfine Bafort as the Hitchcock's blonde (the double of Eva Marie Saint and Tippi Hedren) Looking for Alfred In 2005, prior to making Double Take - which started as a casting, Grimonprez shot the ten-minute video installation Looking For Alfred. The video installation explored the director's search for the perfect Hitchcock double. Grimonprez held screen tests in New York, Los Angeles and London. He chose Mike Perry, a Hitchcock sound-alike and an impersonator of Tony Blair, while Ron Burrage, a professional Hitchcock double, as a result of this search, became a protagonist in Double Take. The project explored the legacy of Hitchcock's persona as well as it made references to his films through restaging his cameo appearances. In 2007, Film and Video Umbrella published a book version of Looking For Alfred with inclusions by authors: Patricia Allmer, Jorge Luis Borges, Chris Darke, Thomas Elsaesser, Tom McCarthy, Jeff Noon and Slavoj Zizek.  Themes  The themes of Double Take are paranoia, falsehoods, contradictions and the rise of the culture of fear played out through the beginning of the television era. Six major themes seem to surface: * 1. Double Bottoms * 2. The Commercial Break * 3. Political Layaring * 4. Reality versus Fiction * 5. The Figure of the Double * 6. Representation of Women  1. Double Bottoms and multilayered metaphors  The multilayered metaphors of Double Take explore not only the character of Alfred Hitchcock meeting his double, but also the era's society as a whole. Hitchcock is cast as a paranoid history professor shadowed by an elusive double against the backdrop of the Cold War, played out through the television tube; he \\"says all the wrong things at all the wrong times while politicians on both sides desperately clamor to say the right things, live on TV.\\" The themes explored in Double Take are all rooted in the following comment by Ron Burrage - the Alfred Hitchcock lookalike: \\"People always do a double take when they see me.\\" And as such the film’s exploration into paranoia is also a double take on the Cold War, a mirror of the fear mongering played over the TV tube.  2. The Commercial Break  The five Folgers commercials for instant coffee that play throughout Double Take are referring to the commercial break of the television format, described by Hitchcock as \\"the enemy of suspense\\" and \\"designed to keep you from getting too engrossed in the story\\". Moreover, the commercials represent the exploration of the theme that fear and murder lurks in the domestic setting, \\"where it always belonged\\". They also imply a yearning for successful 'falsehood'. The question of why the Folgers housewives wouldn't simply prepare real coffee refers to the film's question why our culture yearns for successful imitation—for falsehood. In this contradiction one act masquerades its opposite. The Folgers commercial is subverted in such a way that its message, \\"Drink Folgers,\\" becomes coded as part of a murder plot.  3. Political Layering, The Cold War & The Birds as metaphor  Double Take presents the Soviet Union and the US as doubles in a series of power plays attempting to assure the other's demise. Besides that Double Take is also about how two man always do the talking: in the 'Kitchen Sink Debate' of 1959, the first televised summit live, Nikita Khrushchev outsmarted Richard Nixon, \\"whose best retort to the Soviet leader's critiques of U.S. capitalism is to point to the latest in TV sets\\". Double Take implies that the predominate purposes of the space race as well as the television were propaganda, \\"both individually and, to greatest effect, when acting together\\". The infamous 'Kitchen Sink Debate' mimics the conversation between Hitchcock versus Hitchcock, which mimics the man and woman debate in the kitchen during the Folgers commercials in turn. The mirroring of Hitchcock versus Hitchcock (as Hitchcock frequently doubled himself as the storyteller in his films through his cameos), suggests a similar doubling of Rixard Nixon and the young John F. Kennedy during the first televised presidential debates, the same Kennedy who finds his match in Khrushchev during the Cuban Missile Crisis, and finally Khrushchev versus Leonid Brezhnev just as Brezhnev is plotting Khrushchev's downfall. The paranoia in Hitchcock's work becomes an allegory for the kind of fear that became so normal during the Cold War. Echoes of and excerpts from Hitchcock's The Birds (1963) propose the film as an allegory for television - which has, according to Hitchcock, \\"brought murder back into the home-where it always belonged\\", and as the threat of missiles descending from the sky, suggesting a psychohistorical analogy between the fear of nuclear attack and Hitchcock's suspense.  4. Reality vs Fiction  Double Take plays with different genres against one another and with how fiction comes to stand for reality or the other way around. It shows a recent history against a fiction even while it presents that history itself as an ongoing story of claustrophobic suspense. In the end not only politicians but Hollywood as well are \\"invested in perpetuating a culture of fear\\". Double Take also refers to the doubling of cinema versus television through an intimate fiction story versus a bigger political narrative as well as through the rivalry between cinema and its televisual double. This mirrors the plot that sets up Hitchcock the filmmaker versus Hitchcock the television-maker at a time television was taking over cinema. But Double Take adds a contemporary twist: \\"You think all the way through that cinema is going to be killed by television or television is going to kill cinema or America is going to kill Russia or Russia is going to kill America. But at the end, it’s the third one, the new one, the younger one, the YouTube version, that comes along and kills them all.\\"  5. Cultural References: the Figure of the Double in Literature  Seeing one's own doppelganger is usually a bad omen; it might even be a \\"premonition of death\\". The first narrated line during the 'Borgesian' confrontation between Hitchcock young and old in Double Take launches the plotline and comes with a warning: \\"If you meet your double, you should kill him.\\" This provocative statement one should kill one's identical suggest that doing so means nothing but self- protection or even self-preservation. For it is believed that the double has no reflection in the mirror, it can be seen as a mirror itself: \\"because he performs the protagonist's actions in advance, he is the mirror that eventually takes over.\\" Double Take is based on a similar plot. Hitchcock himself gets eliminated in the first round of a Hitchcock lookalike competition. But all the participants of the competition áre Hitchcock, so \\"he's losing to himself\\". Hitchcock studies are \\"proliferated to such a degree that there are many different Hitchcocks\\". As Thomas Elsaesser notes that we now have a Hitchcock defined as Nietzschean and as Wittgeinsteinian, as Deleuzian and as Derridean, as Schopenhauerian and as many more contradictory things. In this way Hitchcock returns \\"as so many doubles of his own improbable self\\". Jose Luis Borges' initial short story August 25, 1983 is based on Fyodor Dostoyevsky's The Double. as well as on Tom McCarthy's story Negative Reel in the book Looking For Alfred. Authors like Adelbert von Chamisso, Hans Christian Andersen, Edgar Allan Poe and many more were inspired by the idea of the double as well. The narration of Double Take is in fact already a double itself, for it is inspired by Borges' novella The Other (1972). Borges rewrote his novella into Agustus 25, 1983 (1983), and it was the latter one that was reworked for Double Take.  6. Hitchcock's Belly Button, women and male hysteria  Hitchcock often portrays strong females leads, who according to Grimonprez mirror his own fears and phobias projected back onto the female character as a way to try to contain her, or even poison her. Similarly, this male hysteria is also installed between man and man in Double Take. Hitchcocks makes this confession in Double Take: \\"we always fell in love with our characters, that's why we killed them.\\" Grimonprez claims that \\"Hitchcock wants the woman to embody his own desire, but his dreamwoman never redeems his anxiety precisely because she refuses to fit into that mould. The man then is ultimately faced with a split reality.\\" He is doubled, as it were. Just like the moment Sigmund Freud was confronted with his double during a train journey, when the door of the washing-cabinet swung back and Freud didn't recognize himself in the mirror. For a moment he believed someone entered his travelling compartment by mistake. He only realized that the man was nothing but his own reflection when he jumped up to show the stranger the right direction. Freud \\"thoroughly disliked his appearance\\". Whereas this encounter with his double, an anxious feeling crept over him. According to Freud, \\"meeting one's double is an encounter with the uncanny, occurring at the boundaries between mind and matter and generating a feeling of unbearable terror.\\" The double, once a figure \\"endowed with life-supporting power\\", transforms itself \\"into the opposite of what it originally represented. [...] It becomes \\"the uncanny harbinger of death\\"\\". In an interview with Karen Black, the last in a row of Hitchcock’s famous female protagonists who featured in Hitchcock’s final film Family Plot (1976), Black confirms to Grimonprez that the story about Hitchcock actually not having a belly button was true. This story became part of the plotline in the film Hitchcock didn’t have a Belly Button. \\"If Hitchcock didnt have a belly button he might be a clone and there might actually be many doubles of the master, of which Ron Burrage was one\\", wrote Grimonprez. In Hitchcock didn’t have a Belly Button Black does expressions of Hitchcock. And as she is pretending to be Hitchcock she becomes his vocal double. Jodi Dean writes on his blog I Cite that we experience two people but one voice: \\"we hear the one who is speaking and know that it is him, but we also hear another - only rarely do we mistake one for the other, we know the difference\\". Release & Critical Reception Double Take premiered in Europe at the Berlinale and in the US at Sundance. The film was screened at several film festivals, including IDFA. Double Take was released on DVD by Soda Pictures in England and Kino Lorber in the United States. It was acquired for TV release by ARTE in 2011. Variety described Double Take as \\"wildly entertaining\\", The New York Times called it \\"the most intellectually agile of this year’s films\\" and the Hollywood Reporter found the film \\"bracingly original\\", assuming that it \\"would have tickled Hitch himself\\". John Waters mentioned Double Take as \\"My top 10!\\" in Art Forum and Screen described the film as \\"Ingenious, witty, virtuoso!\\". Double Take is part of the permanent collections of the Tate Modern (Artist Rooms) and Centre Pompidou, amongst others. It was screened at the New Directors/New Films Festival (presented by The Film Society of Lincoln Center) and The Museum of Modern Art, MoMA. Prior to release it was pitched at Sheffield Doc/Fest's 2007 MeetMarket.

The motion simulator technology, in development since 1998, is designed to recreate the manner in which vehicles move in earth physics. The company offers a range of simulator products in the category of motion simulation that provide a tactile true motion experience for Motorsport Simulation (sometimes referred to as simracing) and flight simulation. The company's core innovation and technology is the simulation of vehicle (motorsport & aviation based) movement through proprietary physics based software interfaces and a patent pending hardware architecture based on Center of Mass principles of motion. The company's product applications range principally by variation in chassis design and material and are found in usage from military training/research, professional training, to individual simulation and gaming enthusiast entertainment.  History = William MacDonald  William MacDonald, SimCraft's co-founder The history of SimCraft begins in 1997, with William MacDonald; a recently retired engineer from Eastman Kodak and flight simulation enthusiast who established a sole proprietorship and began a retirement project. Unable to find an affordable motion platform for flight simulation, Mr. MacDonald undertook the building of his own system using components available at almost any hardware store. The result of this effort, which took over half a year, was a 3DOF full motion simulator named \\"SimCraft\\" - with full roll, pitch, and yaw axes. This first complete system was a different approach to motion simulation.  First Prototype  The first working iteration of this $1000 motion chassis was made mainly from lumber and PVC but contained elements that still form the underlying concepts of the modern SimCraft motion system. = Center of Mass Architecture = The key component of the system is the concept of using a balanced, center of mass architecture in which the motion chassis rotates about its Center of Gravity (CG). This setup requires a much smaller amount of force to provide a large range of motion, and is different from the Stewart platform type designs, the standard approach in commercial applications over the past several decades, that require large forces for motion. This system of movement is also described by the physics of aircraft. The CG architecture model is intended to mimic a real vehicle's rotational motions since the rotation axes (roll, pitch, and yaw) are mutually perpendicular, always fixed, rotating at or near the actual center of mass (of the sim), and intersecting at a single, static point - as they are in both land and air based vehicles. This approach also separates the degrees of freedom, making roll, pitch, and yaw independent, and independently controlled, from each other. = Pneumatic Actuation = PVC pneumatic actuator and digital valve Although the company's technology has changed over a decade and is now based on electromechanical control, that eliminate latency and safety concerns, the first prototype's motion was supplied by homemade PVC pneumatic actuators and powered by a 4 horsepower canister vacuum cleaner. The vacuum cleaner was capable of producing 2.0 PSI, this pressure coupled with a 3\\" bore linear actuator produced approximately 20 pounds-force or around 90 newtons. The systems positioning was controlled by a series of solenoid based digital valves custom designed by William MacDonald. = Joystick Controlled Motion & Output Controlled Revision = This first motion system developed in 1997/1998 used a \\"follow the joystick\\" approach which is based on the input to the system instead of considering the output result of a simulation. The first modification was to switch to an output, or vector physics, based motion system to represent the movement of the vehicle in a simulation. This approach is currently used in SimCraft's zero latency, physics based, motion control software. = Website and eCommerce = William MacDonald completed several versions of this motion simulation method in fully functional applications and launched www.SimCraft.com in 1998 to sell his plans for $30 to the community of flight simulation enthusiasts. A \\"SimKit\\" was later offered, including some off-the-shelf control components for $350. These plans and kits were sold and distributed in over 20 countries from 1999 to 2001. = Second Prototype and passing of William MacDonald = William MacDonald was working on a next generation motion system when he died unexpectedly in January 2002. This second prototype was not completed or even fully understood as the plans were never documented, but it was determined from the completed work that the new design concept also called for the use of a pneumatic control medium.  SimCraft LLC  Mr. MacDonald's son Sean Patrick formed an LLC in 2004 to continue development of the architecture and refine the product application for both simulated training and gaming entertainment. During the first year of the LLC's founding, market research conducted by Sean Patrick and long time friend and fellow technologist Michael Boardman determined there were various markets for a motion enhanced simulation experience, but that a complete DIY project was not a viable business model. Thus, the build plans for the first SimCraft motion simulator were open sourced and released to the worldwide flight simulation community on SourceForge.net.  CORE Architecture Development  SimCraft worked to refine the Center of Mass architecture and with the specific goal of producing a commercial level 2DOF and 3DOF motion simulator. Electromechanical actuation was adopted as the sole medium for motion control, to eliminate air pressure latency and performance issues, and proprietary rotary \\"knuckle\\" bearings were developed to form the CORE architecture and create the adaptability of various chassis designs.  Extruded Aluminum 2DOF Chassis and Tubular Aluminum 3DOF Chassis  The first application of the CORE architecture was a 2 degree of freedom (roll and pitch) extruded aluminum chassis. This prototype design provided proof of concept and a testing sled for incorporating software motion integrations including physics based racing and flight simulation. A tubular aluminum chassis was later fabricated allowing for the addition of the yaw axis of rotation.  Advanced Technology Development Center  The company was admitted to Georgia Tech's business incubator program, the ATDC in the summer of 2006.  The 8 Series  SimCraft's motion technology develops the 8 Series, featuring the latest in the company's chassis engineering. The APEX is the motorsport version of the sc830 for training professional and amateur race car drivers. This model is used by the Army Corps of Engineers' S.A.V.E. project to study, understand, and simulate the dynamics of a vehicle being driven at high speeds in a loose surface environment.  S.A.V.E.  In November 2007, the U.S. Congress passed legislation funding the SAVE Program, Synthetic Automotive Virtual Environments. The President signed the legislation into law the same month. The SAVE Program is headed up by the Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory (U.S. Army, Hanover, New Hampshire) and Vehicle Control Training, LLC (Franconia, New Hampshire). Congress has authorized funding for FY09 and FY10, FY11 is probable. The SAVE Program is supported in the United States House of Representatives by Democrat Paul Hodes and in the US Senate by Republican Judd Gregg. The SAVE Program enjoys bipartisan, bicameral support. The program includes partners of Ford Motor Company, the US Army, SimCraft, and individual researchers at Georgia Tech and MIT. SimCraft has been selected as the motion simulator supplier for synthetic training development and is also the lead software development resource on the integration of other technologies used within the environment. SAVE came to existence because motor vehicle accidents are the leading cause of accidental death within the military. This cost in lives lost, injury, and damage cuts across all aspects of the military machine and is a limiting factor in mission delivery. The solution proposed by SAVE is the development of three technologies: effective synthetic expert driver skills training, leap-ahead adaptive active safety systems, and autonomous vehicles. The research effort and focus represents an advancement in active safety systems such as ABS braking, dynamic vehicle stability control, and active steering. The first and primary objective of the research is to develop, field, and validate synthetic fundamental driving skills training. At the end of the first year of research, the SAVE program has validated a synthetic environment that effectively trains the following skills: correct eye placement, straight line braking (ABS/non-ABS), accident avoidance, and rollover avoidance.  APEX sc830 Launched  In January, 2009 SimCraft launched the APEX Motion Racing Simulator at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Nevada. The APEX sc830 (later rebranded the APEX3) is a 3 DOF racing simulator with pitch, roll, and yaw motion; fabricated from tubular chromoly steel with powder coated finish. The sim is customized with various controls, visual, and audial technologies, adaptable to individual users.

Jos is the capital of Plateau State, in the middle of the divide between the predominantly Muslim north of Nigeria and the predominantly Christian south. Since 2001, the area has been plagued by violence motivated by multiple factors. The clashes have been characterised as \\"religious violence\\" by many news sources, although others cite ethnic and economic differences as the root of the violence. The first spate of violence of 2010 started on 17 January in Jos and spread to surrounding communities. Houses, churches, mosques and vehicles were set ablaze, during at least four days of fighting. At least 326 people, and possibly more than a thousand, were killed. Hundreds of people died in fresh clashes in March 2010. Many Hausa-Fulani were killed and dumped into wells. This is the third major incident of rioting in Jos in the last ten years. Some one thousand people were killed in riots in 2001, and at least 700 died in subsequent violence in 2008. Overview=January Reports on the catalyst vary. According to the state police commissioner, skirmishes began after Muslim youths set a Catholic church, filled with worshippers, on fire. A local paper reported that attackers yelled \\"Allahu Akhbar\\" before burning down churches and homes. Other community leaders say it began with an argument over the rebuilding of a Muslim home in a predominantly Christian neighbourhood that had been destroyed in the November 2008 riots. Both Muslim and Christian youth have been blamed for starting the violence. A 24-hour curfew was imposed on the city on 17 January 2010. On 19 January, the violence spread to smaller towns and villages south of Jos. Armed mobs, mostly Christians from the Berom ethnic group, attacked Muslims, including Hausa-Fulani residents, killing or driving them out and burning their homes, mosques, and property. The worst massacre took place on 19 January in the settlement of Kuru Karama, where 174 people, including 36 women and 56 children, were killed. Satellite images released by Human Rights Watch show the near complete destruction of buildings in Kuru Karama. The BBC reported the fighting had spread to Pankshin, 100 km from Jos. These reports have been denied by the Army. On 20 January, Vice- President Goodluck Jonathan ordered troops to Plateau State to restore order. Vice-President Jonathan held executive authority at the time, as President Umaru Yar'Adua was in Saudi Arabia receiving medical treatment. The state police command said 326 people died in the January violence. Community leaders put the figure at 1,025 dead. More than 5,000 people were displaced. March Before dawn on 7 March 2010, Muslim Hausa-Fulani herders massacred more than one hundred Christians in Dogo-Nahawa village near Jos. Residents in the village were mainly Berom Christians. The attacks went on for four hours, and nearby villages were also targeted. The attackers fired guns to cause panic and as people fled chopped them with machetes. They set alight many of the buildings and left corpses dumped in the streets. Many of the dead were women and children, including an infant less than three months of age. The state police command reported that 109 people died in the attack, including at least 38 children. A state official told journalists that more than 500 people were killed, while a plaque at a mass grave in Dogo-Nahawa states that 501 died in the massacre, and lists the names of 354 victims. Other community leaders put the death toll at 164, including 34 women and 98 children. Causes The clashes have often been characterised as \\"religious violence.\\" The Plateau State Christian Elders Consultative Forum, for example, referred to the March 2010 attack in Dogo-Nahawa as \\"yet another jihad and provocation.\\" Many others, however, cite ethnic differences and social and economic issues as the root of the violence. The Anglican Archbishop of Jos, Benjamin A. Kwashi, for example, noted that, \\"What seems to be a recurring decimal is that over time, those who have in the past used violence to settle political issues, economic issues, social matters, intertribal disagreements, or any issue for that matter, now continue to use that same path of violence and cover it up with religion.\\" Professor Kabiru Mato of the University of Abuja also played down the role of religion in the riots: \\"I don't see anything religious. Wherein religion could be the difference between the two warring factions, fundamentally it's a manifestation of economic alienation. So social apathy, political frustration, economic deprivation and so many factors are responsible.\\" But this view has been challenged by the fact that places of worship, such as churches and mosques, have always been targeted during these riots. So religion has been used as a galvanising force in the crisis no matter what the initial cause of conflict. An ethnic rivalry between the Hausa and Berom peoples is also cited as a factor in the violence. The Catholic archbishop in Abuja, Nigeria's capital, referred to the violence as \\"a classic conflict between pastoralists and farmers, except that all the Fulani are Muslims and all the Berom are Christians.\\" However, this assertion is challenged by the fact that most ethnic groups in Plateau State, which are predominantly Christian, share the same sentiments with the Berom and collectively see an Islamic threat in their own lands. \\"The Beroms have been accused of resenting the economic progress of other settler groups: yet, this is another simplistic assertion. Most Plateau natives collectively feel they do not have the Federal connections or patronage other major ethnic groups have. And most Nigerian wealth has been driven by oil money. The Beroms and other Plateau natives are predominantly farmers and have had to experience their lands taken away and degraded by tin mining. Now, they have to contend with migrant groups who use Federal influence and wealth to displace them from their own lands. The massive structure of the Federal Government is fuelled primarily by oil money. The Beroms, as well as other Plateau natives, feel they should have a measure of autonomy in their core lands just the way Native Americans in their homesteads are treated as a Sovereign nation, elevated to the status of a protected minority. Nigeria's constitution has no place for respecting the rights of minorities, whether it is Jos, or the Niger Delta.\\"The Economist, 11 March 2010 article \\"Another massacre in Nigeria: An unending cycle.\\" Discrimination against the mainly Muslim \\"settlers\\" of Jos is also cited as an issue. While the mainly Christian indigenous population are classified as \\"indigenes,\\" the mainly Muslim immigrants to Jos, many of them Hausa-Fulani, are classified as \\"settlers,\\" even if they have been living in the city for decades, and find it difficult to secure government jobs or educational scholarships, among other things. This has further accentuated divisions in and around the city. Response The Vatican expressed outrage and sadness at the riots. Pope Benedict XVI said the attacks were \\"atrocious\\" and \\"violence does not resolve conflicts but only increases the tragic consequences.\\" Vice President Jonathan, who was the acting president at the time, urged that the killers be caught. The police announced that 313 people were arrested in relation to the January 2010 violence, while 200 people were arrested following the March 2010 violence. As of 2013, federal prosecutors had secured convictions of at least 129 people involved in the 2010 violence. The Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project wrote to the International Criminal Court, asking them to investigate the riots for potential crimes against humanity. The ICC prosecutor replied in November 2010 stating that the situation was being analysed by the prosecutor to see if a case should be opened.ICC is Analysing Jos Crisis, Says Prosecutor, Daily Trust, 8 November 2010 See also * 2001 Jos riots * 2008 Jos riots * History of Nigeria * Religious violence * 2011 Alexandria bombing ReferencesExternal links * Higazi, Adam, The Jos Crisis: A Recurrent Nigerian Tragedy Discussion Paper No. 2, January 2011, Friedrich Ebert Stiftung * Human Rights Watch (2013), \\"Leave Everything to God\\": Accountability for Inter-Communal Violence in Plateau and Kaduna States, Nigeria Category:Mass murder in 2010 Category:2010 in Nigeria Category:2010 riots 2010 riots Category:Attacks on religious buildings and structures in Nigeria Category:Persecution of Christians by Muslims Category:January 2010 events in Africa Category:Riots and civil disorder in Nigeria ","title":"2010 Jos riots"},{"id":"25866817","text":"Bakhyt Shkurullaevich Kenjeev (Kenzheyev, ; 2 August 1950, in Shymkent, Kazakhstan) is a Russian poethttp://www.bookrags.com/biography/bakhyt- shkurullaevich-kenzheev-dlb/ of Kazakh descent.

Construction was of the monobloc type with autofretting and used a Welin breech block mechanism which could be operated either hydraulically or by hand. Their slow rate of fire, limited elevation and slow traverse made them unsuitable for the AA role, but they were an excellent anti-ship weapon.DiGiulian See also *QF 5.25 inch gun NotesReferences *Tony DiGiulian, Japanese 15.5 cm/60 (6.1\\") 3rd Year Type * External links Category:World War II naval weapons Category:Naval guns of Japan Category:155 mm artillery ","title":"15.5 cm/60 3rd Year Type naval gun"},{"id":"25867191","text":"Merera Gudina (born July 5, 1956) is an Ethiopian professor and a politician. He is the leader of the Oromo People's Congress (OPC), a political party representing the Oromo people. The organization is opposed to the ruling Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front. His party struggles for equality and fairness for all Ethiopian. He has been described as Ethiopia's \\"leading opposition politician\\". Personal life Merera began his college education at Addis Ababa University (AAU), but was imprisoned for seven years due to participating in protests against the dictatorship of Mengistu Haile Mariam. After his release, Merera went to Egypt to complete his education at the American University in Cairo.Uduak Amimo, \\" Profile: Ethiopia's Merera Gudina\\", BBC website, 18 May 2010 (accessed 4 June 2010) Merera received his PhD in Political Science July 2002 from the Institute of Social Studies, at the Hague in the Netherlands under the direction of professors M.R. Doornbos and M.A.R.M. Salih, he completed his thesis, \\"Ethiopia: competing ethnic nationalisms and the quest for democracy, 1960-2000\\".\\"100 Doctoral Theses at ISS\\", p. 34 As of 2009, Merera is an associate professor of political science at AAU. He participates in several scholarly conferences worldwide, including in the United States, concerning political and social developments of Ethiopia. Political career Merera founded the Oromo National Congress (ONC) in 1996, which became the largest Oromo opposition group by parliament seats after the 2005 national elections. His OFC had allied with several other parties to form the United Ethiopian Democratic Forces. Due to a court decision in 2007 which awarded the name of the ONC to a splinter group, the original ONC assumed a new name, the Oromo people's Congress. Merera believes in the self-determination of Oromo people and self-rule under Ethiopia umbrella. His party also wants to make Afan Oromo the co-official language of Ethiopia to empower Oromo people politically, socially and economically. Regarding Oromia secession, he opposes the idea based on mutual strategic and national interest of Oromo and other peoples. Merera has also said Oromo people have historically participated in the creation of Modern Ethiopia, including the monarchy. The Ethiopian State and the Future of the Oromos: The Struggle for \\"Self-Rule and Shared-Rule\\" During a parliament discussion with the ruling party, Merera made the observation, \\"Oromia is the stem of Ethiopia; a stem can not secede, only branches can fall off the stem.\\" OFC was also reported to have made an alliance with another Oromo opposition party named OFDM to form Oromo Federalist Congress (OFC). As of January 2010, Merera is the co-chairman of the OPC and the chairman of Medrek. Merera was detained at the Adis Ababa airport in Ethiopia upon his return from Europe in December 2016. The Ethiopian government cites charges of links to \\"terrorist\\" and \\"anti-peace\\" protests groups. On 3 March 2017, Ethiopian prosecutors formally charged Merera of supporting terrorism, in which he denied. He was put in prison in 2015. He was released from the Kaliti Prison in January 2018.https://www.opride.com/2018/01/18/merera-gudina-welcomes-national- dialogue-says-ball-eprdfs-court/ References Category:The American University in Cairo alumni Category:Living people Category:Oromo People's Congress politicians Category:1956 births Category:People from Oromia Region Category:Ethiopian political scientists ","title":"Merera Gudina"},{"id":"25867193","text":"Bloons Tower Defense (also known as Bloons TD) is a series of tower defense games under the Bloons series created and produced by Ninja Kiwi. The game was initially developed as a browser game, built upon the Adobe Flash platform and released in mid 2007. Later games in the series expanded to support various mobile platforms, including Android, iOS, Windows Phone, PlayStation Portable, and Nintendo DSi. In the game, players attempt to prevent balloons (referred to as \\"bloons\\" in-game) from reaching the end of a set course by placing towers or road items along it that can pop the bloons in a variety of ways. Some towers can stall the bloons and give the other towers more time to pop them by freezing and gluing the bloons. Money is gained by popping bloons, completing levels, and collecting bananas from existing farms which can be spent on new towers, upgrades for existing ones, or temporary items such as exploding pineapples and road spikes.  Gameplay  The main objective of Bloons TD is to prevent balloons, known in-game as \\"Bloons\\", from reaching the end of a defined track on a map which consists of one or more entrances and exits for the bloons. The game is a tower defense game and thus the player can choose various types of towers and traps at his or her disposal to place around the track in order to defend against the bloons, gaining 1 in-game dollar for every layer of bloon popped. If a bloon reaches the end of a path, the player loses lives (or in later games, health); once these are all depleted, the game ends. The bloons always follow the map's set path on the track until they either reach the exit(s), are popped, or are moved to an earlier part of the track by a tower's ability. There are two classes of bloons in the game: regular (unnamed in the game) and MOAB-class. As of Bloons TD 6, the regular bloons consist of: red, blue, green, yellow, pink, black, white, lead, zebra, rainbow, purple, and ceramic bloons. MOAB-class bloons are in the shape of a blimp and consist of: MOAB (Massive Ornary Air Blimp), BFB (Brutal Flying Behemoth), DDT (Dark Dirigible Titan), the ZOMG (Zeppelin Of Mighty Gargantuaness), and the BAD (Big Airship of Doom). Tougher variants of most bloon types contain a number of specified weaker ones. In later versions of the game, regular bloons possess sometimes special characteristics such as camo (which most towers cannot detect), regrowth (the ability for the bloons to slowly grow back to their original size), and fortified (which doubles the health of the toughest bloons), that resist certain tower types. With each level, the intensity of bloon waves proportionately increases. Towers are the main defensive utility in the Bloons TD series. Each tower has its own unique purpose, power, and use, with some being powerful against specific bloons but unable to target others effectively. Every tower can be upgraded to increase power and other capabilities by spending the in-game currency, known simply as 'money', which is earned by popping bloons and at the end of each round. In Bloons TD 4 onwards, certain towers such as banana farms can be placed to produce additional money during a round (end of the round in Bloons TD 4). In later games, there are multiple difficulty levels; for instance, in BTD5, there are four difficulty levels and in Bloons Monkey City there are 5. The higher the difficulty the player plays on, the fewer lives they have and the more each tower and upgrade cost. There are also different types of maps rated by difficulty; in general, there are more types of maps in newer games. Main entries 204x204px There are currently six released numbered games in the Bloons TD series apart from various add-on packs and spin-offs such as Bloons TD 4 Expansion and Bloons Monkey City. The newest release, Bloons TD 6, was released on June 14, 2018. The series was retitled from Bloons Tower Defense to Bloons TD in 2009 due to infringement on the Tower Defense: Lost Earth trademark owned by Com2uS. Bloons Tower Defense and Bloons Tower Defense 2 Bloons Tower Defense is the first game in the BTD series, released in mid 2007 as a free flash browser game. In the game players had to defend against coloured bloons with monkeys, dart throwers, and other towers positioned around the map. When strong bloons are popped they release weaker ones until eventually completely popping. If all lives are lost, the game is over. If all waves are passed, the player will win the game. Bloons Tower Defense 2 was released soon after in late 2007, adding new towers, multiple map options, new bloons, and an option for the game's difficulty. Bloons TD 3 203x203px Bloons TD 3 was released around September 5, 2008, months after the release of Bloons Tower Defense 2, named differently due to a trademark dispute with Com2uS. As with the second game, new towers, bloons, and maps were added. A version based on this game was released for iOS titled Bloons TD; made available on October 3, 2009 from the iOS App Store. This version had extra maps styled in snow and beach themes, and included OpenFeint achievements. The game included 5 map packs, containing a total of 15 different levels to play, with packs unlocked by completing the previous levels. This version of the game was also released for the PlayStation Portable in 2010. Another version of the game, simply titled Bloons TD, was released for DSiWare in 2011, containing 50 rounds to complete. Bloons TD 4 A screenshot of Bloons TD 4 Bloons TD 4 was released on October 26, 2009 as an online freemium game with a proprietary iOS version released on December 7, 2010, developed in conjunction with Digital Goldfish. The gameplay underwent changes including a graphical update, the ability to save the current game, and the introduction of an unlock-based leveling system. The tower upgrading system received various changes including increasing the number of upgrades per tower, and new maps and game modes were added. iPhone and iPad versions of this title have been purchased over one million times. A version of the game was also released as a DSiWare game in 2012. Bloons TD 5 219x219px The original (Flash and freemium) Bloons TD 5 was released on December 13, 2011. The proprietary version of BTD5 was released on iOS worldwide on November 15, 2012 for iPhones and iPods with improved graphics and additional upgrades, tracks, towers, and bloon types. On November 19, 2014 it was released on Steam. Bloons TD 5 Deluxe was released on January 27, 2012, which sets a certain goal for the player to achieve, rewarding him or her with more in-game currency. Also with a new update for the mobile version of BTD5, a new tower was added called the \\"Monkey Sub\\". The submarine was later added to the online version on July 23, 2015. This game also has an unlimited round free play mode, which can have from MOABs to ZOMGs. The Steam/Mobile version has two special mode bosses, the Dreadbloon and Blastapopoulos. The iOS, Android and Steam versions have 15 languages: English, Arabic, Danish, Finnish, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Norwegian, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Swedish, and Turkish. On March 3, 2017 it was released for Microsoft's Xbox One, later releasing for PlayStation 4 on May 9, 2017 and Nintendo Switch on June 13th, 2018, all of which cost $14.99 USD. Bloons TD 6 Bloons TD 6 is the newest game in the main Bloons TD series. After being announced on March 28, 2017 on PRLog, it was released for the iOS App Store and the Google Play on June 14, 2018. A Steam version was released on December 17, 2018. Unlike all earlier games, Bloons TD 6 does not have a Flash-based counterpart on the Ninja Kiwi website. Along with 3D graphics, new features added include three new bloon types, each with unique properties such as immunity to magic and fire, extra health, or immunity to slowing and knockback. Some maps contain obstacles that block the sight of certain towers. Some obstacles are able to be removed by paying a sum of in-game money. Similar to the previous games, players start with a certain amount of starting cash and lives and are required to build towers to defeat a set wave of bloons per round. In-game cash is earned for every bloon popped. Lives are lost when bloons reach the exit. Additional towers and upgrades can be bought to further assist the defense against more difficult rounds. Some towers can directly attack bloons, while others slow down bloons, support nearby towers, or generate in-game currency. Special towers known as \\"Heroes\\" automatically upgrade themselves without player input, or can be upgraded for large cash sums, though only one hero can be placed per game, preselected beforehand by the player. As of the 21.0 update, there are eleven heroes. If playing in a co-op game, each player may place down a single Hero. Special game modes can be unlocked for a map when completed on a certain game difficulty. Each presents changes in gameplay, such as limiting certain tower types, increased tower and upgrade prices, reducing or eliminating external income gain, or spawning stronger waves of bloons. Some game modes start on later rounds or increase the round required to beat the game. Players may also play Daily Challenges, user- created games with special rules not present in normal games. Winning most games earns a special in-game currency called Monkey Money. It can be used to purchase \\"powers\\", which are either temporary boosts or unique towers that cannot be upgraded. Certain heroes are bought using Monkey Money, and each Hero has a unique cosmetic skin that can be purchased. Another currency, called Monkey Knowledge Points, are used with Monkey Money to unlock special tower boosts. Trophies are the newest implemented currency. These are won from completing race or odyssey game modes and can be spent to buy a variety of cosmetics such as hero animations or profile pictures. Spin-offs Apart from the main series, Ninja Kiwi has made several BTD games that include the core gameplay of BTD but are not numbered sequels. Bloons TD Battles Bloons TD Battles was released on December 12, 2012, and later to Android and iOS platforms in-between November 5 and 6, 2013, respectively. On April 20, 2016, it came to Steam as a ported version. The gameplay is similar to that in Bloons TD 5 but two players compete against one another in one of three game modes. In \\"assault\\" mode, each player normally progresses through the levels that are made more difficult. However, the players are also given the ability to purchase additional bloons, sending them to the opponent, overwhelming them. In \\"defense\\" mode, the players play a natural game, the screen split vertically. Players can spend money to increase their income. In \\"Card Battles\\" mode, the players choose from a selection of cards to use in their games. The cards have two functions: Sending bloons to the enemy player, which, like in Assault Mode, will give the player who sends the bloons income, and placing down a tower. All three game objectives are to outlast the opponent in surviving the bloon attacks. The mobile version of Bloons TD Battles is exclusive as it has 5 non-PC towers, the Monkey Sub, the Monkey Engineer, the Bloonchipper, the Heli Pilot, and an exclusive tower called the \\"COBRA\\" (Covert Ops Battles Response Agent). Using the games' skill-based matching system, players can be automatically matched with one another. Bloons Monkey City Bloons Monkey City was released on November 25, 2013. Like Bloons TD Battles, the core gameplay is similar to that of BTD5, however, the player has to maintain a city, expanding the city by capturing bloon- infested areas called tiles.Rogers, Bridget. (2017). \\"Bloons Monkey City Tips, Cheats, & Strategy Tricks – 2018 Guide\\". Gazette Review. Retrieved 10 April 2019. One important goal of the game is levelling up the city. Players earn XP for the city by capturing tiles, completing missions or building towers. Earning higher levels with XP grants access to certain unique game features, like Monkey vs. Monkey, Monkey Knowledge, etc. There is also an in-game feature known as Monkey vs. Monkey, allowing players to fight each other; raids can be launched using the resource \\"Bloontonium\\". This can be acquired by capturing certain tiles or with Bloontonium generators. If the opponent fails to defend against the raid in the set time period, the attacker gains city cash, another resource in the game used to build towers, bloonstones, the 'premium currency' of the game, and city honor, which has no primary purpose in the game other than achievements. One primary difference between this game and the others in the Bloons series is the addition of buildings. Buildings in Bloons Monkey City are required in order to use and to upgrade towers. Some buildings serve as prerequisites to other buildings, while others are prerequisites to using certain bloons in raids, and the number of towers the player can use in a game depends on how many of that specific type of building he or she possesses. Some buildings unlock new monkeys, while others unlock upgrades for these monkeys. Other buildings are required to unlock the tier four upgrades, Camo Bloon defense, and MOAB-class Bloon popping power (the Sun God and Robo-Monkey also require buildings). This game contains 3000 Tiles, and a new MOAB Class Bloon, which is DDT (or Dark Dirigible Titan). In mid-2014, Ninja Kiwi released a new mode known as Contested Territory, a mini- game which offers bonus rewards, and pits players against each other, all of whom compete to survive the most rounds for the longest time on a trickier- than-normal track. This game was released on browsers, but a port to iOS and Android was released on December 3, 2014 and February 18, 2015, respectively. The Steam version was released on April 10, 2020. Bloons Adventure Time TD Bloons Adventure Time TD is a crossover game between Ninja Kiwi's Bloons TD series and Cartoon Network's Adventure Time series that was announced via the Cartoon Network International News Site and the Ninja Kiwi blog on March 8 and 9, 2018, respectively. The game soft launched on July 14, 2018 in Australia, New Zealand, Philippines, and Singapore on Android and iOS and later launched internationally. The game features characters from Cartoon Network's Adventure Time such as Finn the Human, Jake the Dog, and Princess Bubblegum as well as new monkey heroes like Max, Cassie, and C4 Charlie. The gameplay is similar to other games in the series, with a new weapon and item mechanic as well. There are at least 15 adventures and 50 maps to play in that act as the playing stage of the game. Reception Shortly after the release of Bloons Tower Defense, Lore Sjöberg of Wired described the game as cheerful and addictive, calling it \\"pop culture at its best\\". In 2012, Justin Davis of IGN described Bloons Tower Defense as one of the best free tower defense games, despite its \\"amateurish\\" artwork. He later noted the first entry's lack of depth, and that the sequel improved this. IGN editor Daemon Hatfield said that he thought Bloons TD 3 succeeded in standing out in the crowded genre by having sufficient core game mechanics and adding an individual twist. The game's iOS version received mixed reviews with some authors praising the unique towers and good gameplay, though the user interface, controls, and lack of leaderboards were criticised. The DS version received similar reception, with Lucas Thomas of IGN describing it as \\"a pretty good take on good old Bloons TD.\\" Eurogamer's Kristan Reed gave the PSP version 8/10, describing it as \\"transfixing\\", though he said that the music appeared to be designed to \\"drive you insane\\". GameZebo editor Jim Squires gave Bloons TD 4 a 3.5/5 rating, praising it on its well designed maps and towers and for having a large amount of content, but he criticized the game for not \\"bringing anything new to the genre.\\" GamePro editor Ryan Rigney gave Bloons TD 4 a 2/5 rating, stating that it had the same Bloons Tower Defense gameplay as the previous titles, and \\"the screen eventually gets so hectic that it's no longer fun to play\\"; an issue which many other reviews also responded negatively to. Bloons TD 5 was received similarly to its previous version, with reviewers commenting positively on the number of maps, towers, and levels, but criticising the lack of innovation to the tower-defense genre and performance issues at higher levels. Both Bloons TD 4 and Bloons TD 5 featured among the top 10 paid iPhone apps in the iOS App Store, with Bloons TD 4 selling over 1 million copies. Bloons TD remained in the top 100 apps for at least 3 months, and Bloons TD 5 was the 8th most purchased iPhone app in 2013. Overall, the game series has been played over 1 billion times across web and mobile devices.

William Wilberforce Bird had the same name as his father, who was Member of Parliament for Coventry. He was born in 1784 and educated in Warwick and Geneva before being nominated to join the British East India Company in 1802. After training, he arrived in Calcutta in 1803, where he undertook further training at the Fort William College and was then posted to Benares. Bird conducted himself well in Benares, including on occasions when he had to deal with civil disturbances involving local people. He was involved in both financial and judicial work before being appointed to the Supreme Council of India, of which in due course he became president when the then Governor-General of India was absent. He served as Deputy-Governor of Bengal Presidency throughout the period when Lord Ellenborough was Governor, standing in for him while Ellenborough was engaged in the North-Western Provinces. Bird then replaced Ellenborough as Governor-General of India, acting in that capacity until the arrival of Sir Henry Hardinge from England in 1844. Hardinge reappointed Bird as Deputy-Governor of Bengal Presidency but Bird had retired from service and returned to England by the end of that year. In the same year, until October, he was President of The Asiatic Society. Bird married Hannah Elizabeth Brown, second daughter of David Brown, in Benares on 11 August 1818. He died at home on 1 June 1857. In the long-running debate concerning education in India, Bird favoured the secular cause, along with people such as Thomas Macaulay, as opposed to one that desired further to promote a Christian basis for schooling. He said in 1835 that secular education was having good results in India and raised concerns that a Christian approach might upset the native people, potentially leading to what he described as \\"catastrophes of a very serious description\\".

The princeps (from Latin, meaning \\"first man\\") was another title for the emperor. Overview The Consilium Principis had a foundation in imperial Roman government until the time of Emperor Diocletian (284-305 AD). Augustus throughout his reign took the legislative control from the Senate and placed it under his auspices. However it was the creation of this new body that stood to make the Senate a second tier legislative body, as fundamentally the Consilium Principis controlled the bills put forward to the Senate. Therefore, the Senate, the most important administration of the Roman Republic, remained in name only. Scullard states, \\"But though in practice the senate increasingly developed into an active legislative assembly, the initiative and advice behind its activity may often have come from the emperor.\\" Whilst the Senate grew in prestige with 3 censuses to reduce its membership in 28BC, 18BC and 11BC and similarly with the imposition of its membership with the requirement that senators be worth 1 million sesterces, Augustus increasingly had the foremost role in the Roman state. The consilium principis comprised Augustus, the consuls and 15 senators with lower ranking members rotating out of the body every six months, however, owing to Augustus' auctoritas and him being princeps the body fell under his auspices. Scullard reinforces this notion saying \\"In one important way he made the Senate more efficient and at the same time, more amenable to his own wishes: he established a senatorial standing committee.\\" It was in Augustus' 76th year (AD 13) that he became unable to, through his old age, properly manage the Senate and as a result required counselors, consisting of supporters and family members, to partake in controlling the legislation of the Senate. The passage in Dio Cassius illuminates the councils position in the government of Rome: Dio 56.28.2 (AD 13) 'He also asked for twenty counselors on account of his age, which did not permit him to go to the senate-house any longer except on rare occasions; previously it seems he had associated himself with fifteen advisors for six months at a time. It was also voted that any measure should be valid, as being satisfactory to the whole senate, which should be resolved upon by him in deliberation with Tiberius and with these counsellors, as well as the consuls of the year and the consuls designate, together with his grandchildren (the adopted ones, I mean) and such others as might at any time call on for advice.' The Consilium Principis grew in power over the course of imperial Rome and, by the third century AD, became the foremost element of imperial administration. The body, by the reign of Constantine the Great, became the sacrum consistorium and was recognized as an independent department of the imperial government.

Diplomatic recognition by France of Haiti came in 1825, twenty-one years after Haiti's declaration of independence in 1804.The Briefest History by Africa Speak The payment of an indemnity to the former French plantation owners was originally suggested by Haitian president Pétion in 1814 as a way to deter a possible French attack on his country. Independence debt Haiti’s legacy of debt began shortly after gaining independence from France in 1804. In 1825, France, with warships at the ready, demanded Haiti compensate France for its loss of slaves and its slave colony. In exchange for French recognition of Haiti as a sovereign republic, France demanded payment of 150 million francs. In addition to the payment, France required that Haiti discount its exported goods to them by 50%.https://www.thenation.com/ In 1838, France agreed to reduce the debt to 90 million francs to be paid over a period of 30 years to compensate former plantation owners who had lost their property. The modern equivalent of $21 billion was paid from Haiti to France.Sommers, Jeffrey. Race, Reality, and Realpolitik: U.S.-Haiti Relations in the Lead Up to the 1915 Occupation. 2015. . Page 124. The transfer of wealth from Haiti to the French government and from Haiti to the various banks that financed the Independence Debt is well established. Detailed claims, submitted by former slave owners for compensation, including the monetary value of the \\"lost\\" slaves, and which formed the basis for the French government's demands have been documented. Likewise, the terms of the 1825 Ordinance and accounts of its negotiation have survived. The French government finally acknowledged the payment of 90,000,000F in 1893. It took until 1947 for Haiti to finally pay off all the associated interest of the debt. The story of the first payment – 24,000,000 gold francs – being transported across Paris, from the vaults of Ternaux Gandolphe et Cie to the coffers of the French Treasury was recorded in detail. Historians have traced loan documents from the time of the 1825 Ordinance, through the various refinancing efforts, to the final remittance to National City Bank in 1947. 2003 demand for reparations In 2003, President of Haiti Jean-Bertrand Aristide demanded that France pay Haiti over 21 billion U.S. dollars, what he said was the equivalent in today's money of the 90 million gold francs Haiti was forced to pay Paris after winning its freedom from France. The United Nations Security Council, of which France is a permanent member, rejected a February 26, 2004, appeal from the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) for international peacekeeping forces to be sent into its member state Haiti, but voted unanimously to send in troops three days later, just hours after Aristide's controversial resignation. \\"I believe that (the call for reparations) could have something to do with it, because they (France) were definitely not happy about it, and made some very hostile comments,\\" Myrtha Desulme, chairperson of the Haiti-Jamaica Exchange Committee, told IPS. \\"(But) I believe that he did have grounds for that demand, because that is what started the downfall of Haiti,\\" she says.\\" The cost to Haiti was arguably much higher than the original sum, because Haiti had to raise the money via loans that carried interest. Conversely, had the sum been invested, it would have yielded 69 trillion dollars by 2014 at a nominal rate of 4% after inflation, or 90 thousand trillion at an 8% annual return commonly assumed for equities. Following the 2004 Haitian coup d'état, provisional prime minister Gerard Latortue rescinded the reparations demand, calling it \\"foolish\\" and \\"illegal\\". 2010 earthquake Following the 2010 Haiti earthquake, the French foreign ministry made a formal request to the Paris Club on January 17 to completely cancel Haiti's external debt. A number of commentators drew references from the early 19th-century indemnity demand and how it had severely depleted the Haitian government's treasury and economic capabilities.

Originally devised by entrepreneur and DJ Graham Kentsley, it was one of Europe's first satellite delivered radio stations, receiving a Satellite Television Technology International (STTI) award for satellite communication innovation. History The Supergold oldies radio format was originally a creation of Mike Harvey the US Disk Jockey in the mid 80's. Mike could to be heard on weekday mornings on WEBG-FM 100.3 and on Saturday nights coast to coast in the US as the host of \\"SuperGold\\". In 2017 Harvey still has two syndicated programs broadcast in the US.The nightly Mike Harvey Show and SuperGold Weekend. The format was acquired from Transtar Radio by the \\"Satellite Music Network\\" of Dallas, Texas USA - Supergold became one of SMN's many radio formats. In 1987 Graham Kentsley a young entertainment music and media entrepreneur and satellite communication expert from St Albans UK. Decided that with the launch of several new European satellites there was now a need for a Pan European satellite sustaining radio service and set about with his brother Steven Kentsley in launching the Telstar Satellite Music Network (a division of Kentsley's own Telstar Satellite TV company). Kentsley being a music and radio enthusiast had previously installed the first Satellite TV/Radio system in any licensed premises (The Adelaide Wine House in St Albans UK). In 1987 Kentsley visited the studios of the SMN in Dallas, Texas and reached an agreement with SMN to take the \\"Supergold\\" format to Europe on a trial basis. Supergold was launched in the UK in November 1988 from the EAP studios in Frinton Essex UK and broadcast on the Intelsat Satellite 27.5 (on a mono audio subcarrier) initially heard between the hours of 11pm and 6am UK time (a high quality ISDN line took the signal from Frinton in Essex to the British Telecom Docklands uplink facility via the British Telecom Tower in central London). \\"Supergold\\" was put off the air for a whole night on one occasion when a cow chewed the ISDN line somewhere outside Clacton in Rural Essex UK. TSMN offered the remaining daytime broadcast time for Satellite audio distribution (commercials and news distribution) and a private radio user group (shop chains) a European first. TSMN was planning a second radio format \\"Country\\" Gold \\\\- This was also a European first. On the first night on air, Supergold was opened by CEO Graham Kentsley, followed by the first show presented by Tony Gillham the programme director. (Gillham later went on to work for Chiltern Radios, who later acquired the European Supergold format.) Telstar by the Tornados was the stations signature tune (played at the top of every hour during the station optout). Supergold used an innovative sub-audio tone switching system to allow local stations on the network to opp in and out of the program's the system was developed by Graham Kentsley and his brother technical director Steven Kentsley - to the listener it sounded as if they were listening to their own local radio station during this overnight period allowing affiliates to substantially cut their operating costs. TSMN Flexiclock Supergold Supergold broadcast its experimental service successfully for approx 6 months signing up several European affiliates including stations in Spain, the Channel Islands (UK)/France Contact 94 - Gibraltar (GBC) and Vienna in Austria (Blue Danube Radio). However it became clear to Kentsley and to the TSMN management that they would not be able to reach the critical mass of radio affiliates required to make the station commercially viable after this initial trial period. Kentsley discussed the position with another St Albans UK resident Peter Burton then Chairman of the local radio group Chiltern Radio and the SuperGold format moved homes from the TSMN to the Chiltern Radio group. Tony Gilliam went on to work for the Chiltern Radio Group and the New Supergold format. Kentsley later tendered without success for the St Albans Local radio franchise (StAR FM = St Albans Radio ) along with Verulam radio and Chiltern Radio.Tony Gillham was again the proposed programme director for StAR FM. Tony Gillham is now with the community radio stations Black Cat Radio and BBC Radio Jersey. The St Albans radio franchise was finally awarded by the Radio Authority to the largest commercial radio operator in the area Chiltern Radio. The Chiltern Radio Supergold service was launched at 10am on Sunday 24 June 1990, following requests from the Radio Authority for radio stations to split frequencies into separate AM and FM services or lose them. The first presenters heard were Tony Lloyd and Colin Wilsher. It was broadcast from Studio 1 at the Studio HQ in Dunstable, Bedfordshire and was first heard on Chiltern Radio's 792 kHz AM, 828 kHz AM transmitters and Northants Radio's 1557 kHz AM transmitter. Later, Chiltern acquired Gloucestershire's Severn Sound in 1989 and this led to the rebranding of their 774 kHz AM service as Severn Sound Supergold in 1992. Elsewhere, Coast AM, Invicta FM's medium wave AOR/soft rock station, was renamed Coast Classics and began playing more 'oldies'. By 1990 it became a fully fledged 'Golden Oldies' station and in 1991 it started taking the SuperGold service on its 1242 kHz and 603 kHz AM frequencies. As a result, the station was renamed Invicta Supergold. However, just before this change took place, and for most of Summer 1991, presenters referred to the station Coast Classics Invicta Supergold on air, to allow listeners to get used to the change. It achieved a 17% reach in a JICRAR survey; some say much to the disgust of its Southern Radio Group bosses who, it has been said, preferred their AM stations to hover around the 9% mark. Radio Maldwyn in Mid Wales, western Shropshire, north western Herefordshire also took Supergold as a sustaining service overnight. Programmes The original weekday presenters included Colin Wilsher for breakfast, Bill Overton with an hour's phone-in at 10.00am, Dave Foster till 3.00 p.m., and Tony Lloyd at Drive, until 7.00 p.m. Sunday programming included Paul Burrell and the Elvis Hour with Willie Morgan who later went on to host 'Sunday Will Never Be The Same' in early 1991. Burrell later went on to become the Breakfast Show presenter, and Morgan became the Head of Music for the SuperGold network, and latterly the Programme Controller of SuperGold, as well as presenting most of the station's 'specialist programmes inc. Beatles Hour, Classic Soul Hour, Rock & Roll - The Real Thing (co-hosted with Burrell), Get on The Right Track (a classic Album Track show). He also produced & presented the 40 min slot \\"Down In The Vaults\\", which was the junction between the Breakfast show and the more lifestlyle-orientated mid morning sequence.' Closure The Supergold network closed on Sunday 1 September 1996 following the takeover of Chiltern Radio in 1995 by the GWR group. In place of Supergold, listeners would now receive Classic Gold. The takeover also enabled GWR to base Classic Gold at Chiltern's HQ in Dunstable, where Chiltern's own Supergold service had previously been based.

Castle site Iberg Castle is located south-west of the town of Wattwil. The central keep is six stories tall and has an entrance on the north-west corner. The keep is surrounded by a curtain wall. The castle hill is protected by moats and some walls. History Iberg Castle was built in 1240 by Heinrich von Iberg who was a vassal of the Prince-Abbot of St. Gallen. The castle was briefly conquered in 1249 following the Toggenburg fratricide and again in 1290 during the rule of the anti-Abbot Konrad von Gundelfingen in St. Gallen. It was damaged during the Appenzell Wars in 1405 and soon thereafter rebuilt. During the conflicts leading to the Battles of Villmergen (from 1699-1712), the castle was besieged in 1710. After the Treaty of Baden in 1718 it was given back to the Abbot. During the suppression of the monasteries in 1805, the castle became privately owned. Some of the housing was demolished in 1835, but the roof and battlements were rebuilt in 1902 and 1965 by the municipality.

The party was founded in August 1974 by \\"moderate\\" defectors from Anders Lange's Party. Led by Carl I. Hagen, the party merged back into ALP already in May 1975, after Hagen—as Anders Lange's deputy—had become a Member of Parliament following Lange's sudden death in October 1974. History The Reform Party was founded in Voksenåsen in Oslo on 31 August 1974 by Kristofer Almås, Deputy Member of Parliament Carl I. Hagen and others who broke away from Anders Lange's Party. They claimed that Lange was an \\"extremist\\", and criticised what they considered as his unwillingness of taking political responsibility, consistent refusal of political moderation and of establishing a political program. When Anders Lange died in October 1974, Hagen became a regular Member of Parliament as Lange's former deputy, and thus gave the Reform Party parliamentary representation. In opinion polls in January and February 1975 the Reform Party saw its support at 0.4%. On 13 May 1975 the party was split after Almås had been thrown as party chairman by the party board, and in turn reorganised the party under an \\"interim board\\" with himself as party chairman. Hagen responded by stating that he held control of the party finances and its membership rolls counting 700 members. On 26 May 1975, Hagen reconciled with his former party, and merged the Reform Party back into ALP at a meeting with the party's parliamentary leader Erik Gjems-Onstad. In January 1976, Almås claimed that Hagen almost single-handedly had made a deal to merge into ALP, and that the \\"new board\\" had come together and issued a demand for Hagen to return the party's membership roll. Hagen in turn maintained the legitimacy of the party's merger with ALP. On 26 October 1976, Almås withdrew from his position as party chairman (although he remained a member), as well as politics in its entirety, as he claimed to have been subject to massive harassment as a result of \\"incorrect\\" coverage of the events surrounding the party by the mass media. On 19 January 1977, the party secretary, Peter N. Myhre, announced that he also withdrew from his position, after a meeting intended to solve the crisis in the party (where 17 members showed up) reportedly only resulted in quarrels and name-calling.

The Court found that police have the right to take garbage bags placed for collection at edge of a property without warrant. In this case, the accused abandoned his privacy interest when he placed his garbage for collection at the rear of his property where it was accessible to any passing member of the public. His section 8 rights under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms were not violated when a police officer seized bags of garbage at the rear of his property and used the contents of seized bags as evidence of criminal activity. Background The police suspected that the accused, Russell Stephen Patrick, was operating an ecstasy lab in his home. On several occasions in December 2003, they seized bags of garbage that the accused had placed for collection at the rear of his property adjacent to a public alleyway. The police did not have to step onto the accused's property to retrieve the bags but they did have to reach through the airspace over his property line. The police used evidence of criminal activity taken from the contents of the accused's garbage to obtain a warrant to search the accused's house and garage. More evidence was seized during the search. Lower Court Rulings=Trial Court At his trial, the accused argued that the taking of his garbage bags by the police constituted a breach of his right guaranteed by section 8 to be free from unreasonable search and seizure. The trial judge held that the accused did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the items taken from his garbage and, therefore, the seizure of the garbage bags, the search warrant and the search of the accused's dwelling were lawful. He admitted the evidence and convicted the accused of unlawfully producing, possessing and trafficking in a controlled substance. Court of Appeal On appeal, the Court agreed with the trial judge and upheld the convictions. Supreme Court Ruling The accused appealed to the Supreme Court. The following issues were put to the Court: # whether police breached accused's right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure # whether accused abandoned his privacy interest in contents of garbage bags when he placed them at edge of his property for collection. The Court found that the police did not breach the accused's right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure and that the accused has abandoned his privacy interest when he placed his garbage for collection at the rear of his property where it was accessible to any passing member of the public. The accused did everything required to rid himself of the items taken as evidence. His conduct was incompatible with any reasonable expectation of confidentiality. Neither the search of the contents of the accused's garbage nor the subsequent search of his dwelling breached s. 8 of the Charter. Hence, the evidence seized in both searches was admissible at the accused's trial and should not be excluded under section 24(2) of the Charter. Expectation of privacy standard Expectation of privacy is a normative standard. Privacy analysis is laden with value judgments which are made from the independent perspective of the reasonable and informed person who is concerned about the long‑term consequences of government action for the protection of privacy. In assessing the reasonableness of a claimed privacy interest, the Court is to look at the “totality of the circumstances”, and this is so whether the claim involves aspects of personal privacy, territorial privacy, or informational privacy. Frequently the claimant will assert overlapping interests. The assessment always requires close attention to context and first involves an analysis of the nature or subject matter of the evidence in issue. The reasonableness of an expectation of privacy varies with : * the nature of the matter sought to be protected, * the circumstances in which and the place where state intrusion occurs, * and the purposes of the intrusion. In this case, the accused's garbage was put out for collection in the customary location for removal at or near his property line and there was no manifestation of a continuing assertion of privacy or control. Territorial privacy is implicated in this case because the police reached across the accused's property line to seize the bags; however, the physical intrusion by the police was relatively peripheral and, viewed in context, is better seen as pertaining to a claim of informational privacy. The accused's concern was with the concealed contents of the garbage bags which, unlike the bags, were clearly not in public view. Abandonment Abandonment is a conclusion inferred from the conduct of the individual claiming the s. 8 right that he or she had ceased to have a reasonable expectation of privacy with regard to it at the time it was taken by the police or other state authority. Being an inference from the claimant's own conduct, a finding of abandonment must relate to something done or not done by that individual, and not to anything done or not done by the garbage collectors, the police or anyone else involved in the subsequent collection and treatment of the \\"bag of information\\". The accused abandoned his privacy interest in the information when he placed the garbage bags for collection at the back of his property adjacent to the lot line. He had done everything required of him to commit the bags to the municipal collection system. Since the accused had abandoned his garbage before it was seized by the police, he had no subsisting privacy interest at the time it was seized. The police conduct was objectively reasonable. The accused's lifestyle and biographical information was exposed, but the effective cause of the exposure was the act of abandonment by the accused, not an intrusion by the police into a subsisting privacy interest.

The eight-story building was constructed in 1909 for the DeWitt–Seitz Company, a furniture jobber and mattress manufacturer. With It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places for its local significance in the themes of architecture, commerce, and industry. It was nominated for its status as a rare surviving example of the manufacturing and jobbing factories that once populated Duluth's early-20th-century waterfront, and for its exemplary Chicago School architecture. In 1985 the building became the DeWitt–Seitz Marketplace, a mixed-use commercial building with shops and restaurants on the lower floors and office spaces above. History The building was designed in 1909 in the Chicago school style popularized by Louis Sullivan. Its original tenant, the DeWitt–Seitz Company, was one of many jobbing companies founded in the port city of Duluth, buying goods from manufacturers in the eastern U.S. and Canada and selling them to growing inland markets in the west. Like many of its fellow jobbing houses clustered near the Duluth Ship Canal, DeWitt–Seitz expanded into manufacturing its own products, in their case mattresses. By the 1930s, Duluth's jobbing industry declined rapidly in the face of increased competition, market changes, and the Great Depression. The DeWitt–Seitz Company began to focus primarily on mattress production and sale, under the brand Sanomade. Sam F. Atkins purchased the company in 1961 and renamed it The Happy Sleeper. In 1983, the mattress business relocated to Eau Claire, Wisconsin, and Atkins' son began renovating the old building from an industrial warehouse into retail and office space. Renamed the DeWitt–Seitz Marketplace, it opened in May 1985. Three of the first tenants—the Blue Heron Trading Company, Art Dock, and J-Skylark—continue to operate in the building as of 2019. A new owner took over the building in 2000, adding more office spaces on the upper floors and restoring the exterior in 2007.

The slice of life series focuses on the relationship between Shiro Kakei and Kenji Yabuki, a middle-aged gay couple living in Tokyo, Japan. The manga has been serialized in the manga magazine Morning since 2007, and was adapted into a live-action television drama by Shochiku that aired on TV Tokyo in 2019; a film sequel to the television drama is slated for release in 2021. Both the manga and its live-action adaption have received widespread critical acclaim, winning a Kodansha Manga Award, a Galaxy Award, and multiple Television Drama Academy Awards. Synopsis What Did You Eat Yesterday? follows Shiro Kakei and Kenji Yabuki, a middle aged gay couple living in Tokyo, Japan. Shiro is a serious and reserved lawyer, while Kenji is cheerful and outgoing hairdresser. Each chapter in the series focuses on Shiro and Kenji as they encounter a particular comedic or dramatic scenario, often focused around issues of domestic life, workplace humor, and LGBT rights in Japan. Many of the chapters depict a sequence in which Shiro, a gourmand, purchases food and prepares a meal for himself and Kenji. Shiro narrates the steps to create each dish through his internal monologue, and frequently prepares meals that have significance in relation to the plot or themes of the chapter. The collected tankobon editions of the series contain the recipe for the main dish prepared in each edition. The events of the series progress in real time: Shiro and Kenji were respectively 43 and 41 years old when the series began, and as of chapter 101, are 52 and 50 years old. Media=Manga What Did You Eat Yesterday? was first released as a manga series written and illustrated by Fumi Yoshinaga.

Reception=Manga Five million copies of the Japanese edition of What Did You Eat Yesterday? are in print as of January 2019. The series has received positive reviews from critics, particularly for its realistic depiction of gay life in Japan, and is noted as being one of the first pieces of mainstream Japanese media to substantially portray a cohabiting gay male couple. Writing for Manga Bookshelf, Katherine Dacey praised the series for showcasing \\"the realities of gay life in Japan depicted in such a matter-of-fact way,\\" while not being \\"preachy or dreary.\\" Writing for ComicsVerse, Melissa Padilla cited What Did You Eat Yesterday? as a series that subverts typical LGBTQ manga and anime tropes, noting that it includes a \\"realistic depiction of a gay couple who are adults rather than high school or college students\\" and that it \\"tackles gay issues while still maintaining a leisurely, slice-of-life pace.\\" What Did You Eat Yesterday? was a nominee for the inaugural Manga Taishō Award in 2008, and a jury recommendation at the 13th Japan Media Arts Festival in 2009. It has been listed for Book of the Year twice by Media Factory's Da Vinci, placing sixth in 2014 and fiftieth in 2016. In 2019, the series won the Kodansha Manga Award for Best General Manga.

The series was additionally awarded the July 2019 Galaxy Award, given by the Japan Council for Better Radio and Television. Analysis=Portrayal of gay domestic life Writing for Culture, Society and Masculinities, Katsuhiko Suganuma notes that the relationship between Shiro and Kenji is depicted as largely non-sexual, contrasting stereotypical media portrayals of gay men as hypersexual or sexually deviant. Far from reinforcing equally permissive stereotypes of gay men as emasculated, Suganuma argues that by not depicting Shiro and Kenji's sex life, the series \\"intentionally ignores the expectations of the curiosity-ridden heteronormative public\\" to focus on the domestic lives of gay men. Consequently, he cautions against interpreting What Did You Eat Yesterday? as being merely assimilationist or homonormative, arguing that it \\"provides readers with occasional instances of modification of gender and sexuality norms in contemporary Japanese society.\\" Portrayal of masculinity Xuan Bach Tran has noted that while cooking media featuring men in Japan typically foregrounds competition and pursuits of excellence, as in series such as Iron Chef and Oishinbo, What Did You Eat Yesterday? depicts cooking as merely a hobby and a necessity for life. While Shiro embodies many of the traits of the \\"herbivore man\\"—he is unambitious in his career, and largely socially withdrawn—he falls out of this category through his love of cooking, and derives his masculinity from \\"self-care and expressions of selfhood\\". Suganuma concurs in Culture, Society and Masculinities that as Shiro's utilitarian cooking style is neither archetypically masculine nor archetypically feminine, it \\"[distances] itself from a polarized gender binary.\\" ReferencesFurther reading * A.

Biography Oleg Tistol was born in the township Vradievka (Mykolaiv Oblast) in a family of scientist-agriculturist Michael Fedorovich Tistol. In 1970 his mother, Bolgarina (Tistol) Valentina Sergeevna obtains a position of the regional management Head of culture. Oleg moves with his parents to Mykolaiv. He starts his art education in 1972 at the children's art school which has founded in Mykolaiv on his mother's initiative. In 1974 he enters Kiev Republican Art School, the Department of Painting, and moves to Kiev. In 1978-79 he works as a designer in Mykolaiv's Khudfond (Art Foundation). Between 1979–1984 Tistol studies at the Lviv State Institute of Decorative and Applied arts. In 1984 - 1986 he serves in the Army in military unit Makarov-1 where he gets acquainted with Konstantin (Vinny) Reunov. In 1988 Oleg married the painter Marina Skugareva. While the participation in the first Soviet-American exhibition Soviart Oleg Tistol get acquented with the artist Dmitry Kantorov, who invites him to Moscow's squat Furmanny Lane. At the end of 1988 Tistol and Reunov in cooperation with the curator Olga Sviblova start to exhibit their works in Glasgow, Reykjavík, Helsinki. Between 2002–2009 Oleg Tistol works with the curator Olga Lopuhova (The joint retrospective project Khudfond (2009)). Since 1993 he lives and works in Kiev. Work Project of Ukrainian Money. Roxelana. 280х480 cm. Oil on canvas. 1995. The art of Oleg Tistol (paintings, large-scale installations, photos, sculptures, and art objects) has always been in the center of the artistic process, what is illustrated by his regular participation in the international art events. Tistol's art, which emerged at the edge of the Soviet and post-Soviet epochs, combined both a critique of Soviet culture with re-evaluation of its clichés, as well as the vital, joyful, and playful atmosphere, which largely defined the appeal of the “Ukrainian new wave”. Combining in his works the national and soviet symbols, myths and utopias he discovered for himself the notion of simulacrum — a copy with no original. Such a paradoxical self-sustainability of propaganda as substitution for the non-existing items unexpectedly unites propaganda with pop-art. Tistol was primarily interested in its formal aesthetic aspects - stencil plates, color back-ups, smoothly painted surfaces. Oleg Tistol's early works, the large- scale paintings (“Zinovy Bogdan Khmelnitsky” (1988), “Reunification” (1988), “The Farewell of Slavyanka” (1989), “Exercise with Maces” (1989)) demonstrate the main features of the Ukrainian “new wave” — free play with symbols, bright expressive colors, and special “exaggeration” of artistic devices. In 1987 Oleg Tistol and Konstantin Reunov pronounced the program “A Resolute Edge of National Post-Eclecticism”. Its main idea was the aspiration to outline the national space as a theme for studying, to renew and reconsider the art language, art traditions and foundations of the painting. The national tradition, which is often identified with \\"Cossack baroque\\", became the object of research of Ukrainian painters. Domestic mythologicality of the world outlooks, the retrospection of the orientations and the ambiguity of the stereotypes have been represented as a cultural drama, as its traditional features. TV + Realism. 25.12.2009. 150х200 cm. Oil on canvas. 2009. Simultaneously, starting from the middle of the 90s, Oleg Tistol and his fellow artist Mykola Matsenko began to develop the concept of “Natsprom” (“National Industry”), or a study of the national stereotypes fixed in the surrounding environment. Their projects: “The Museum of Atatürk”, “The Museum of Architecture”, “The Museum of Ukraine”, “The Mother of Cities” - which combined painting, photography and art objects - are a perfect example of clarity and adequacy of the concept, as well as strictly determined authors’ position. Architecture appears in this series, as a certain decoration, set capable of providing décor to most surprising life performances. At the same time, after having passed through the filters of artistic vision, both famous and ordinary buildings – the embodiment of gone-by styles and social ambitions – appeared as visions and ghosts, that at any moment are ready to relinquish their place to new architectural fantasies. In this way, the artists’ works drew the Ukrainian public’s attention to an extraordinarily important theme of manipulation with historical heritage marked by the popularity of “architectural re-constructions” which fulfilled many Ukrainian cities, having the traditional layouts, with the stylized fake buildings.G. Sklyarenko. Tele- realisms of Oleg Tistol. (Скляренко Г. \\"Телереалізми\\" Олега Тістола) // Fine Art (Образотворче мистецтво). - 2009.- № 2 The theme of “stereotypes” was continued by Oleg Tistol in his painting series “National Geography” (1998–2004) where he combined “the local” and “the foreign”, the authentic and the borrowed, the ethnic and the global problematic. The sources of this series were the old illustrated magazines with ethnographic photos of “different tribes”. National exoticism was viewed here as the contemporary strategy of “selling local brands in the global market”.B.

There is no such thing even in Europe\\" (the portrait of Gennadiy Kozub, the founder of Biruchiy contemporary art project). Fakty i Kommentarii. 11 January 2014. Since 2006 Tistol is working on the project “U. B. K.” (the Russian abbreviation for “Southern Coast of Crimea”). Continuing his search for stereotypes, the painter finds them in his everyday life. The principal subject of the project are the palm trees on Yalta's quay. It's also the continuation of the theme \\"national geography\\", where Crimea is the symbol of place for holidays, relaxation, paradise. Tistol is attracted by its man-made environment, which transforms the landscape into the part of a culture, as the palm trees are not authentic Crimea's trees, they were planted here in the 20th century, forming its \\"new stereotype\\". The different techniques such as photo, painting, drawing, used in \\"U. B. K.\\", passed one into another.G. Sklyarenko. Palm trees for Roxelana.

The officers distinguished themselves and excited much interest in Caprilli's new system of \\"forward riding,\\" which, at the time, represented a repudiation of traditional manège-style dressage techniques. Around 1913 senior coronet Vladimir Sokolov introduced Littauer to Caprilli's revolutionary method of riding.Littauer, Vladimir S. Russian Hussar. London: J.A. Allen & Co. Ltd., 1965.

In 1927 he happened to meet two fellow former Russian cavalry officers in New York: Sergei Kournakoff and Kadir A. Guirey.Littauer, Vladimir S. Horseman's Progress: The Development of Modern Riding. Princeton: D. Van Nostrand Company, Inc., 1962. (p. 226) Together the three founded the Boots and Saddles Riding School, teaching principles of dressage they had learned in cavalry school, but soon they began experimenting with the radical and progressive Caprilli methods. The forward riding precepts of Caprilli proved more practical and accessible than traditional manège-influenced dressage for their civilian riding students who had limited time for riding and varying levels of fitness. Despite the Great Depression, the Boots and Saddles School thrived, adding a new ring and stables in New York City. Writing career Littauer began writing, publishing Jumping the Horse in 1931 and The Defense of the Forward Seat with his co-founder, Kournakoff, in 1934. In 1937 Littauer left Boots and Saddles to begin working with students on their own horses and to offer riding clinics at schools, colleges and hunt clubs. By this time he was recognized \\"as one of the most influential teachers, lecturers and equestrian authors in the country.\\"Steinkraus, William C. \\"Foreword.\\" The Development of Modern Riding. New York: Macmillan Publishing Company, 1991. (p. xiv) Littauer continued to teach and write for the next thirty years. He was a frequent guest lecturer at Sweet Briar College in Virginia where one of his students, Harriet Rogers, founded a riding program for the college. Over the years Littauer conducted original research which, through his writing, resulted in major contributions to the sport of riding. In a 1972 speech, Rogers referred to Littauer as \\"the outstanding proponent of Forward Riding in this country.\\"Rogers, Harriet H. \\"Founder's Day and Thanksgiving Rolled into One.\\" Sweet Briar College Alumnae Magazine 42.(2) Winter (1972): 30. Former Director of the Sweet Briar College Riding Program and author Paul Cronin called Littauer \\"the most influential author and instructor in America in this century.\\"Cronin, Paul D. \\"Boot, Saddle, to Horse and Away!\\". Sweet Briar College Alumnae Magazine. Spring (1976): 34. George Morris cites Littauer in his list of \\"the greatest American authors\\" on riding.Morris, George H., and John Strassburger. George H. Morris : Because Every Round Counts. Victoria, B.C: Trafford, 2006. p.205 Legacy A few of Littauer's significant contributions to modern riding include his accurate analysis of the gaits and mechanics of the jump; his recognition and advocacy of controls as a component of a forward seat riding system; his development of three levels of control for teaching riders and for schooling horses; his advocacy of the voice as an aid in schooling and in riding; his definition of the concept of stabilization; and his philosophy that encourages riders to feel empathy for their horses.Cronin, Paul D. Schooling and Riding the Sport Horse: A Modern American Hunter / Jumper System. Charlottesville and London: University of Virginia Press, 2004. pp.268-269 His teachings continue to be advocated and supported by the American National Riding Commission and taught by schools affiliated with the ANRC. Although Littauer retired from teaching in the late 1970s, he continued to write until the early 1980s. He died at his home on Long Island on August 31, 1989 at the age of 97. His personal library, including his instructional film and manuscript collection, resides at the National Sporting Library in Middleburg, Virginia. Vladimir Littauer was married to Mary Aiken Graver Littauer in 1935 in New York City. They had one son, Andrew A. Littauer of Princeton, New Jersey.

Spurius Lartius was one of the two companions of Horatius, who defended the Pons Sublicius against Lars Porsena in 508 BC. A few years later, Titus Lartius became the first Roman dictator. However, the gens all but vanishes from history after this period. A family of the same name existed in the late Republic and under the early Empire, but their relationship to the earlier Lartii is unknown.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. II, p. 723 (\\"Lartia Gens\\"). Origin The Lartii were one of several noble families of Etruscan origin during the early Republic. The nomen Lartius is a patronymic surname, based on the Etruscan praenomen Lars. This name, meaning \\"lord\\", is usually spelled Larth in Etruscan inscriptions, but Latin writers also used Lars in place of the Etruscan praenomina Laris and Larce, apparently distinct names in Etruscan. The nomen is always spelled Lartius in Livius, while Dionysius alternates between Λάρκιος, Larcius and Λάργιος, Largius. All three forms appear on Latin inscriptions.Chase, pp. 129, 135, 136. Praenomina The only praenomina associated with the Lartii of the early Republic are Titus and Spurius. The Larcii of the late Republic and early Empire used Lucius and Aulus. Branches and cognomina According to Dionysius, the Lartii at the outset of the Republic bore the surname Flavus. However, Rufus is found in place of Flavus in some inscriptions. As the consuls of the early Republic are known to have been brothers, it seems possible that one of them, having fair hair, was called Flavus, while the other, having red hair, was called Rufus. The cognomina are now so confused that it is impossible to determine which was which.Broughton, vol. I, pp. 6, 7, 18.
