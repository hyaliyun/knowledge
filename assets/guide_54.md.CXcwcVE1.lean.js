Biography Bukovsky was born in Cerov√°, Slovakia, on 18 January 1924, the fourth of six children. He entered the Society of the Divine Word seminary in Nitra, Czechoslovakia, in 1939. The Society sent him to the United States for additional studies in 1947. Ordered to return to Czechoslovakia when the new Communist government revoked his passport, he instead with the help of Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley reentered the U.S. from Canada as a legal immigrant. He was ordained in December 1950 in Techny, Illinois, as a priest of the Divine Word Missionaries and became a U.S. citizen a few years later. In 1952 he received a degree in sacred theology from Catholic University. He then pursued an academic career, teaching at St. Mary‚Äôs Seminary in Techny for 14 years and studying at the University of Chicago's Oriental Institute and earning a degree from the Pontifical Biblical Institute in Rome in 1966. In the 1970s, while Bukovsky served a six-year term in the office of the General Council of the Society of the Divine Word, an elected position, Cardinal Agostino Casaroli recruited him to join the Secretariat of State. While working there Bukovsky frequently lunched with the pope. He was also named to the Curia's Council for Public Affairs and made several trips to explore relations between the Holy See and the countries of Eastern Europe. For 17 years he headed the Secretariat's Eastern Europe desk. On 18 August 1990, Pope John Paul II named him titular archbishop of Tabalta and Apostolic Nuncio to Romania. He was the first Nuncio to Romania of the post-Communist era. On 20 December 1994, he was appointed the first papal representative to the Russian Federation. Bukovsky had some significant successes there, regaining partial control of the former seminary in St. Petersburg. Bukovsky retired upon the appointment of his successor, Giorgio Zur on 29 January 2000. Pope John Paul named him a member of the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity and a consultor to the Secretariat of State on 6 June 2002. He died in Techny on 18 December 2010.

Construction began under the emperor Trajan in the 2nd century AD and it was destroyed twice by earthquakes in the 6th and 10th centuries. It is the largest amphitheatre ever built in the Balkan Peninsula with once having a capacity of 20,000 people. The amphitheatre is included on the tentative list of Albania for inscribing it as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It was discovered in late 1966 and has become a popular tourist attraction. History A paleochristian mosaic in the chapel. The amphitheatre was built in the beginning of the 2nd century AD. It was used for performances until the 4th century AD. The earthquake of 345/346 likely damaged the monument and closed the 'ludii gladiatorii'. An early Christian chapel was constructed on the amphitheatre in the second half of the 4th century. The chapel was initially decorated with frescoes; in the 6th century, mosaics were added. A medieval chapel was built in the 13th century, also decorated with frescoes. The amphitheatre was covered over in the 16th century, after the Ottoman occupation, when the wall was built nearby. Marin Barleti described the monument as 'well constructed'. About one third of the site was discovered and excavated in the 1960s by Vangjel Toci; the rest was excavated in the 1980s by Lida Miraj. After excavation the amphitheater slowly deteriorated, as no conservation efforts were undertaken prior to the 2000s, and construction continued to take place around the site. In 2004 the University of Parma started restoration work to save the monument. Site The amphitheatre has an elliptical shape with axes of and . The arena is by and is high. It is built on a slope of the hill, and inside the amphitheatre there are staircases and galleries at different levels. The chapel with mosaics is preserved. The site currently functions as a museum.  Dangers  The amphitheatre is surrounded on all sides by the city of Durr√´s, and a section of the arena itself has been built upon with modern housing. Thus, development pressures threaten the long-term preservation of the site. The municipality of Durr√´s is now planning to remove the houses. The amphitheatre has serious structural deficiencies, and its mosaics and paintings are slowly decaying. In 2013, the amphitheatre was shortlisted along with thirteen other sites by Europa Nostra as one of the most endangered cultural heritage sites in Europe.

Lena Kundera and Bianca Montgomery are fictional characters from the American daytime drama All My Children. Commonly referred to by the portmanteau \\"Lianca\\" (for Lena and Bianca), they were the first lesbian couple on an American soap opera. Lena was portrayed by Olga Sosnovska, and Bianca was portrayed by Eden Riegel. Lena and Bianca's romance \\"quickly became a hit with viewers\\" and regularly surpassed older more established heterosexual couples for the #1 spot on Internet and soap opera magazine readers' polls. The characters are the first to share a same-sex kiss in American soap opera history. Background =Writing and portrayals= The writers characterized resident lesbian and good girl Bianca Montgomery's romantic life as tortured; she consistently fell for heterosexual or unavailable women. When the series showcased her having fallen in love with best friend and confidante Maggie Stone (Elizabeth Hendrickson), this theme was continued. Maggie declared herself heterosexual and told Bianca she was only romantically interested in men. To show Bianca moving on, and to add conflict to Bianca and Maggie's relationship, the writers introduced Lena Kundera in December 2002. Lena, a \\"sassy\\" bisexual from Poland, was characterized as a temptress \\"in the mold of Juliette Binoche\\". Bianca instantly found Lena attractive and competed for her attention with friend Boyd Larraby (Marc Menard), as they bet on which one of them could date Lena first. Viewers watched as Lena began spending time with Bianca as part of an \\"evil plan\\" to take over Bianca's mother's company, but also as she found herself falling in love with Bianca. In an interview reported by the New York Post, Brian Frons, head of ABC Daytime, stated that he considered the Lena and Bianca pairing \\"much bolder\\" than romantically pairing Bianca with \\"longtime\\" galpal Maggie. Bianca was 19 and Lena was in her late 20s, around the same age as Boyd. The writers had Bianca win the bet against Boyd, and Lena and Bianca bond easier despite their age difference. Boyd was suspicious of Lena's intentions, and persuaded mother-figure Myrtle Fargate (Eileen Herlie) to chaperone the couple. Though Myrtle saw nothing to convince her of malice on Lena's part, Boyd's suspicions were valid. \\"Lena has made a lot of mistakes in her past,\\" clarified Eden Riegel, Bianca's portrayer. \\"She has not proven herself a very nice person. Of course, Bianca doesn't know that. And now Lena is working with Michael (a bad guy played by William deVry) to try to take down Enchantment.\\" Michael Cambias, portrayed by actor William deVry, was scripted as Lena's business partner and lover. As part of a secret plot to destroy Bianca's mother, Erica Kane, and her cosmetics company (Enchantment), Lena was told by Michael to get close to Bianca so Bianca could be more easily manipulated. The writers showcased Lena's guilt regarding the takeover plan after she developed romantic feelings for Bianca. She refused to continue the manipulation, but was blackmailed by Michael into following through with the takeover. Lena eventually decided to leave town rather than betray Bianca and tell her the truth. She informed Bianca that she could never see her again. \\"For Bianca, this was a huge disappointment,\\" said Riegel. \\"Every time she opens up to a woman, she gets her heart broken.\\" To reunite the couple in dramatic fashion, the show had Myrtle urge Bianca to follow Lena to the airport and demand an explanation; on the April 23, 2003 episode, the two characters shared the first same-sex kiss in American soap opera history. \\"It's that kind of old romantic airport scene in which the two lovers decide whether they can take the risk and take a chance on love -- only it's two women this time,\\" relayed Riegel. Riegel had never kissed a woman before. \\"I was a little nervous because I wanted it to look natural and organic and real and true,\\" she said. \\"I didn't want it to seem tentative.\\" Riegel and Olga Sosnovska discussed practicing the kiss. \\"We thought about maybe trying it out in the dressing room first,\\" Riegel laughed. \\"But then we just thought, 'We are professionals. This will be fine.\\" The writers detailed \\"fun and daring\\" moves in the episode, such as having Bianca discuss with Myrtle her confusion about Lena leaving her. Myrtle, in her aristocratic British accent, replied, \\"Maybe it was too hot!\\" Giving insight into Bianca's unlucky romantic life, she suggested that Bianca loves unavailable women because her mother is always running away from true love. The physical aspects of Lena and Bianca's romance were heavily downplayed by the series. When asked if she thought she and Riegel had succeeded in living up to the \\"couple's groundbreaking and progressive\\" reputation, Sosnovska responded, \\"Yes, we succeeded to a certain extent. We succeeded in making this couple acceptable.\\" After a pause, Sosnovska continued, \\"Not acceptable in a realistic sense, since our relationship hasn‚Äôt been portrayed truly realistically, which would have been nice.\\" She described Bianca and Lena's physical relationship as \\"kind of ostentatiously reserved\\" compared to what gets shown between heterosexual couples, \\"although I‚Äôm quite shocked by what does get shown between the heterosexual couples.\\" Even though the couple had recently started \\"dating\\" again, as the writers also scripted a love triangle including Maggie, there was an apparent double standard regarding intimacy between the same-sex lovers; in the entire year of Lena and Bianca's on-again, off-again relationship, the two women had only kissed twice onscreen. The final obstacles given to the couple's onscreen intimacy were Bianca's rape by Michael and pregnancy with his child, which were controversial and seen by viewers as desperate attempts by the network to avoid lesbian love scenes. AfterEllen.com editor Sarah Warn stated that it was a way to assure Bianca's continued asexuality. Warn added that \\"the pregnant-lesbian storyline\\" is a favorite refuge for television writers who both want to avoid dealing with the sexual aspects of lesbian relationships and who want to \\"normalize\\" the lesbian characters‚Äî\\"to show viewers that, at their core, lesbians are just like heterosexual women‚Äîwho of course, all want to be mothers\\". In 2004, though Lena and Bianca were allowed to kiss for a third time onscreen, it came at the end of their romance, as Lena went back to Poland to tend to her ailing mother and the couple was later written to have broken up over the phone. Reception and impact =2003 kiss = A magazine cover touting Lena and Bianca's first kiss. All My Children made television history on April 23, 2003 when Lena and Bianca shared the first same-sex kiss in American soap opera history. The kiss was not the first same-sex kiss for daytime television. The United Kingdom had featured its first lesbian kiss between fictional characters on the soap opera Brookside ten years earlier in December 1993, portrayed by actresses Anna Friel and Nicola Stephenson. Lena and Bianca sharing a kiss, however, and also being between two people of the same sex, was something that had been thought of as unlikely for American soap opera. The kiss received media attention such as TV Guide, Soap Opera Digest, and other publications. On the day before the kiss aired, Riegel and Sosnovska appeared on the morning talk show The View and answered questions from Barbara Walters and the other hosts, including guest host Monica Lewinsky. Star Jones introduced the segment by stating that All My Children had dealt with a number of controversial topics, including \\"AIDS, abortion, drug abuse, racial prejudice, and teenage alcoholism, but no storyline has generated the kind of buzz as the lesbian kiss\\". The kiss was shown to the audience and followed up with questions by the hosts consisting of whether the actresses were nervous acting out the intimate scenes and what it was like to portray lesbians. Critics were mixed on how the Lena and Bianca kiss was portrayed, on whether it was as realistic as it should be. Heather Havrilesky of Salon.com stated, \\"Not the most passionate kiss, but satisfying enough, given that most of the episode was devoted to showcasing the big event.\\" The kiss represented a change in American culture. Stephen Tropiano of PopMatters said, \\"In perhaps what could be a step in the right direction, daytime television has at last included the first on-screen kiss between a same-sex couple.\\" Tropiano, however, criticized shows treating same-sex kisses as \\"big events\\". He stated, \\"Over the years, television has repeatedly made the same point by treating a kiss exchanged between two members of the same sex as something out-of-the- ordinary and unnatural. It's the network brass more than television series writers and producers who have reinforced society's negative attitudes toward public displays of affection between gay and lesbian couples by treating same- sex kissing as a taboo subject.\\" Tropiano wondered now that Lena and Bianca had kissed if they would kiss again or go beyond that in regards to physical intimacy; he felt that it was not likely until society, or at least, television, began to regard a same-sex kiss as just a kiss. When asked if soap opera fans were ready for the kiss, Riegel stated, \\"I know that on the (Internet) message boards, there is a small but vocal minority that didn't want to see this. But the vast majority (of fans) were ready, excited and with the storyline.\\" For All My Children fans, who had witnessed Bianca's unlucky romantic life, the kiss \\"was long overdue\\". =Popularity= Lena and Bianca's romance was groundbreaking. Prime time television was already significantly ahead of soap operas in their representation of gay men and lesbians. With the pairing of Lena and Bianca, American soap opera was given a level of LGBT visibility that it had not had before, and now had two lesbian icons instead of Bianca by herself. The pairing \\"quickly became a hit with viewers\\" and regularly surpassed older more established heterosexual couples for the #1 spot on Internet and soap opera magazine readers' polls. \\"In another historical first, in October 2003, 60,000 votes were cast\\" in Soap Opera Weekly's Hottest Soap Couple contest; Lena and Bianca emerged as the winning couple; this resulted in the first time a same-sex couple had ever been featured in a 2-page \\"glossy\\" centerfold poster, which was \\"sold at grocery store check-out counters across America with nary a complaint\\". This was viewed as groundbreaking social change. Though the couple was popular, they were also controversial. Sosnovska was asked if she realized that by accepting this role she would be stepping into \\"so much\\" controversy. \\"I‚Äôm still coming to terms with this phenomenon of Lianca,\\" she replied, \\"with the devotion that I‚Äôm shown as a couple on TV, and the whole concept of fans. The letters that I get are heart breaking. It‚Äôs horrible that even now in the 21st century [so many lesbians] feel the need to hide. Not everyone is confident enough to face the world, and not everyone lives in a safe environment.\\" She continued, \\"I never really thought about it before--it doesn‚Äôt occur to you that this medieval type of mentality occurs. It‚Äôs horrifying what happens.\\" Sosnovska did, however, see the decision to be out as a personal choice. \\"I don‚Äôt blame people who choose not be out,\\" she said. She donated her time to fan sponsored fundraisers that raised money for several charities connected to the Lena and Bianca storylines. Over $20,000 had been raised for the New York City Gay and Lesbian Anti-Violence Project. Sosnovska stated, \\"I would never have known what a powerful tool TV could be, especially daytime. It‚Äôs frightening to the extent it‚Äôs a huge responsibility on the producers, directors, and actors to influence minds. You can‚Äôt underestimate the force of it.\\" Sosnovska was overwhelmed by the outpouring of support from fans. \\"I apologize to anybody who‚Äôs sent me anything and hasn‚Äôt gotten a reply. I physically can‚Äôt keep up with it (the volume of mail), especially when I go away,\\" she said in emphasis of a recent trip to London she had made. In addition to helping with fundraisers, Sosnovska was outspoken about gay marriage. \\"I've been listening to the debate about gay marriage, she said. \\"It‚Äôs very difficult to wrap my head around people who oppose such a basic right. There‚Äôs no logic behind any of these reasons [against gay marriage]. [Those opposed to it] have no idea about the fact that they‚Äôre talking about normal people.\\" In this respect, Sosnovska hoped her role as Lena had helped, if even a little, since \\"the more human faces you can put to this story, the better\\". AfterEllen.com cites that lesbian and bisexual women do not have \\"many characters\\" they can call their own, and had never had a daytime couple that they \\"could pin [their] hopes and dreams on\\". Sosnovska and Riegel together as Lena and Bianca \\"became that couple\\" and the audience was given \\"the chance to see two sexy, confident, and very out women together as daytime television's first lesbian couple\\". Though prime time dramas such as The L Word feature more lesbian and bisexual content, it is only available on cable. All My Children's advantage is that it is seen \\" in homes across the country that might not intentionally tune into shows with lesbian characters\\". The fact that a significant portion of viewers grew up with some of these characters enabled the series to develop \\"a certain comfort level\\" with the audience that other television characters do not have. AfterEllen.com theorized that what endeared the Lena and Bianca romance to \\"so many viewers across the country\\" and allowed them to create a significant contribution to the acceptance of lesbians and bisexual women onscreen and in society was chemistry This chemistry, the website reasoned, made the pairing a fan favorite. The website stated that \\"one of the main reasons that viewers both gay and straight\\" thoroughly liked this pairing \\"was the amazingly realistic portrayal of two people in love who just happen to be women\\". \\"They are both sensational actresses who, though heterosexual, committed wholly to the relationship,\\" said Mimi Torchin, former founding editor-in-chief of Soap Opera Weekly and then columnist for the magazine along with soap opera website SOAPnet.com. \\"You weren't aware so much that history was being made but rather that this was something beautiful and special that you had never seen before,\\" she stated. \\"There was a purity to their love that made it non-threatening to the straight audience.\\" Lena and Bianca's romance was a classic soap opera story of love and redemption‚Äîthe bad girl saved by the love of an innocent. They became one of the show's most successful romances. \\"[Lena and Bianca were the No. 1 couple in daytime],\\" said Riegel. \\"They embraced Bianca with a fervor usually reserved for only the hunkiest of heroes. That experience taught me to never underestimate the open-mindedness of daytime audiences.\\" See also *Bianca Montgomery and Maggie Stone *Reese Williams and Bianca Montgomery *Supercouple *List of supercouples References Further reading * External links *Official ABC page *Bianca Montgomery @ Soapcentral.com *Lena Kundera @ Soapcentral.com Category:All My Children characters Category:Fictional lesbians Category:Soap opera supercouples Category:Fictional LGBT characters in television ","title":"Lena Kundera and Bianca Montgomery"},{"id":"20121825","text":"Totalschaden (Total Damage) is the first album by the German hip hop artist Tony D.

The newspaper began to form in the late 1980s after the collapse of the LGBT newsmagazine OUTWEEK (which came into existence in 1989 to compete against the then-dominant New York Native‚Äîwhich itself folded in 1997). OUTWEEK was known for firebrand activist style journalism and provided coverage of a then nascent gay rights movement. It was one of the first publications to undertake scientific reporting on the growing AIDS crisis. After an investor squabble that closed the magazine, Troy Masters, then an advertising director at OUTWEEK, led the formation of a group to create a new publication; that publication became known as QW (or QueerWeek), the first glossy gay magazine, and was funded by William F. Chafin. Chafin died before the publication could make a profit, and the magazine was closed upon his death. Two years later, Masters sought to establish a newspaper and founded LGNY (Which stood for \\"Lesbian-Gay New York\\"). LGNY published for eight years and was relaunched in 2002 as Gay City News. Masters continued in his role as publisher until leaving the publication in 2015.

Early life Baldwin was born in 1834 at his family's estate, Bunker Hill, near Millersville in Anne Arundel County, Maryland. He was the son of William Henry Baldwin (1792‚Äì1874) and Jane Maria (n√©e Woodward) Baldwin (1798‚Äì1866). His father served with distinction in the War of 1812, under Commodore Lewis Warrington, and his grandfathers both served in the American Revolutionary War, commissioned officers in the 1st Maryland Regiment under General William Smallwood. He was educated in the South and moved to New York before the beginning of the Civil War. Career After moving to New York, he was associated with the dry goods business of Woodward, Baldwin & Co., which did a lot of business in the South, and controlled several of the largest manufacturers in the South. In this role, he served as president of the Louisville and Nashville Railroad for four years when he resigned due to management differences with the other major stockholders. In 1884, he was appointed a member of the New York Aqueduct Commission by then Gov. Grover Cleveland, who was a close friend of his. He succeeded George W. Lane and served for four years, retiring in 1888. After the Commission, where he was instrumental in the construction of the Croton Aqueduct, he returned to railroads and with D. J. Mackey, he invested in the Evansville and Crawfordsville Railroad. He was also a director of the New-York Life Insurance Company and a trustee of the New-York Security and Trust Company. In 1894, then President Cleveland appointed him Naval Officer of the Port of New York, Baldwin replaced Theodore B. Willis, who had been appointed by President Benjamin Harrison.

Playing career Born in Amiens, Baticle started his professional career in his native Picardy region at Amiens SC but quickly attracted the attention of Guy Roux who recruited him at AJ Auxerre. He played his first game in Ligue 1 on 19 September 1991 against FC Metz. In the 1992‚Äì93 season, he was the UEFA Cup's top goalscorer as Auxerre reached the semi-finals where they were edged out by Borussia Dortmund after a penalty shootout. A year later, Baticle scored one of Auxerre's goal during the final of the French cup where the AJA defeated Montpellier HSC 3‚Äì0 to win its first national title. In the 1994‚Äì95 season, he had to face the concurrence of an emerging Lilian Laslandes for the sole striker post in Guy Roux's emblematic 4-3-3. Baticle then chose to move to an ambitious RC Strasbourg side where he joined a team composed of Frank Leboeuf, Franck Sauz√©e and Aleksandr Mostovoi. He spent three seasons at Strasbourg and was a captain there after Leboeuf's departure in 1996. He was repositioned as an offensive midfielder by Jacky Dugu√©p√©roux and, in this position, was instrumental in Strasbourg's 1997 League cup triumph as well as the good UEFA Cup run the following season. He was then back for a season and a half at Auxerre as a transition striker between world champion St√©phane Guivarc'h and the young Djibril Ciss√©. In December 1999, he was transferred to FC Metz where he enjoyed decent success as a striker for three years in a struggling team. When Metz was relegated, Baticle moved to Troyes AC for a season before ending his career in 2003‚Äì04 with Ligue 2 side Le Havre AC. Coaching career Baticle was a successful youth coach for three seasons with AJ Auxerre's under 18 team, reaching the final of the Coupe Gambardella in 2007. In October 2008, Pascal Janin was sacked from his post at Stade Brestois and it was rumoured that general manager Corentin Martins was eager to bring his former Auxerre teammate at Brest for the managing job but the move was at first opposed by Auxerre's president Jean-Claude Hamel.http://www.letelegramme.com/sports/une/gerald- baticle-brest-le-president-dauxerre-dit-non-20081014-3979130_1495718.php Ultimately, a compromise was found and Baticle joined Brest,http://www.lefigaro.fr/football/2008/11/03/02003-20081103ARTSPO00506-un- epilogue-heureux.php winning his first game 4‚Äì0 against SC Bastia on 7 November 2008.

It is the first in the United Kingdom to have a fan-shaped orientation. The arena officially opened its doors on 4 September 2013 with Sir Elton John, playing to an audience of 12,000. Bruce Springsteen had, however, held the first concert on 24 July 2013, with an audience of 13,000. The arena's opening season in 2013 later included acts including Kaiser Chiefs, Rod Stewart, Status Quo and Depeche Mode. The building has been nominated as one of England's greatest landmarks, and won best new venue in the world in 2014. History =Public demand for an arena in Leeds= Looking towards the main entrance. Eddie Vedder and Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam at the First Direct Arena, 8 July 2014 Leeds had been the largest city in the United Kingdom without a major venue to hold music or indoor sporting events. , Bristol and Leeds were the only major cities without an arena style venue. Previously, the Queen's Hall was used for popular music concerts but this was demolished in 1989. Since 1989, there have been a number of failed attempts at building a major venue in Leeds. An arena has been long requested by residents in Leeds. The consultation on the Vision for Leeds 2004 to 2020 showed a strong demand from the public for a new arena, and the project became one of the city's 12 priorities.Vision for Leeds 2004‚Äì2020 ‚Äì Leeds Initiative p. 32 The Leeds Initiative formed a Cultural facilities task group to consider options. It appointed PMP consultants whose report outlined the viability of a Leeds Arena, and other potential projects such as a concert hall. The task group recommended that the Council proceed with the development of a 12,500 seat arena. Whilst this study was taking place, campaigners including the Yorkshire Evening Post lobbied for a new arena to be built in the city. This resulted in a widescale 'Leeds needs an arena' campaign that had endorsements from local artists including the Kaiser Chiefs as well as local businesses and residents. The campaign was well publicised in local media, and included popular Myspace and Facebook groups. =Developer and operator competition= Following this, competitions began to find an operator and developer for an arena. In March 2008, SMG were chosen as the future operators of the first direct arena, following worldwide interest from potential operators in the scheme. SMG also operate arenas in Newcastle, Belfast and Manchester and over 200 other venues worldwide. The addition of Leeds strengthens their position in the UK Arena market. SMG's European managing director has stated that Leeds will be its \\"flagship venue\\" in Europe and that they expect First Direct Arena \\"to be in the top 10 in the world within two to three years of opening\\". Two main bidders were involved in the competition to develop the arena. These were the Council owned land at Elland Road as one location which would have been developed by GMI Construction and land owned by Montpellier Estates in Sweet Street, Holbeck with Montpellier Estates being developer of the latter site. However, in November 2008, Leeds City Council announced they had terminated the developer competition and chosen Claypit Lane as the site for the new arena and would proceed as the developer. This resulted in a legal challenge from Montpellier Estates. Montpellier's claim for more than ¬£43.5 million was rejected by Mr Justice Supperstone in a Judgement handed down on 6 February 2013. =Plans= The arena's location, on Claypit Lane is situated at the Northern Quarter of Leeds city centre, behind the Merrion Centre. The land the arena was built on was the Claypit Lane Council car park and land formerly owned by Leeds Metropolitan University. Demolition of the former Leeds Metropolitan building was completed in 2009. Independent economic impact assessments conducted by Yorkshire Forward show that the new arena will bring over ¬£25 million to the local economy every year and bring 300 full-time jobs. The money provided by Leeds City Council will come from part of the proceeds from their sale of Leeds Bradford International Airport in October 2007, Yorkshire Forward grant support and revenues from rent and commercial activities. The total scheme costs are estimated to be in the region of ¬£80 million including land costs. The arena is constructed in a super theatre fan shaped format as opposed to the more conventional bowl or horse-shoe seating arrangement commonly used by most arenas in the United Kingdom. The arena promises 'perfect sightlines' from each seat and the longest distance from the stage is 68 metres as opposed to 95‚Äì110 metres at a traditionally designed Arena. According to the City Council, flat floor seating and 15 rows of retractable seating can be removed to create a huge floor area holding thousands of standing spectators. The interior design is flexible and the First Direct Arena accommodates a range of events including: * Music concerts in various configurations * Comedy events * Family shows, such as \\"Walking with Dinosaurs\\" * Ice dance shows and family dance shows * Basketball * Tennis * Boxing/ Wrestling/ UFC * Shows ranging from 1,500 capacity to 13,781 capacity The external design was announced in August 2010. The external design has a honeycomb design. This design uses ‚Äì a voronoi diagram ‚Äì to create cellular shapes that are visible on key approaches to the arena. On an evening, the front of the building has the ability to change colour or pattern dependent on the show or mood of the arena at the time. =Construction= First Direct Arena during construction Construction work on the First Direct Arena commenced in February 2011. Construction was completed by May 2013, with a public open day scheduled for 25 May. = Naming rights = On 2 May 2013, telephone and internet bank First Direct were announced as the sponsor of the arena, with the name officially becoming the First Direct Arena. The naming rights were set to expire in 2018. However, it was announced in March 2017 that First Direct had extended its naming sponsorship for a further 5 years, continuing to be called the First Direct Arena until at least 2023. = Opposition from South Yorkshire = Yorkshire Forward's support and intended ¬£18 million funding has gained much publicity and has been subject to fierce political fighting. Some critics outlined that public funding is common on most recent Arena developments as seen in the Manchester, Nottingham and Liverpool developments. Each arena gained public funding and this was not protested by other established arenas. However, there was some opposition to the Leeds Arena from the owners of Sheffield Arena and Clive Betts, MP for Sheffield Attercliffe, who believe that the arena would adversely affect Sheffield Arena especially as the Leeds Arena would acquire funding from Yorkshire Forward. However, Yorkshire Forward stated that they fully support the development of an arena in Leeds and that an independent economic impact assessment also showed that a Leeds Arena would be of benefit to the entire region. Subsequently, Yorkshire Forward reaffirmed support to provide funding to the scheme. However, following a decision by BIS, central government initially did not authorise Yorkshire Forward to provide funding to the scheme. Soon after, it was announced that ¬£9.9 million funding was authorised by central government. This was met with fierce criticism from Sheffield MPs, but received positive responses in the Leeds City Region. Events Manic Street Preachers at the arena in 2018.

Barron, who is supposed to be the first one who visited Nainital, from Rosa, an English business man in sugar trade, on an expedition accidentally coming across the lake at Nainital was so captivated that he decided to build a European Colony on shores of the lake. The news magazine, the Englishman Calcutta, reported in 1841 discovery of this lake near Almora.http://nainital.nic.in/history.htm Nainital History It is believed that two Indian sages visited there, wandering, it is a belief of people that they blessed the lake with divine power, one can acquire divinement by taking bathe in it, and the same as in the Mansarovar lake. Topography and Hydrology The lake is bounded by the high and steep Naina peak on the North West side, by the Tiffin Top to the south west side and snow view peaks on the north. Coniferous forest trees cover these hill ranges. The annual rainfall in the basin area of the lake is reported to be 1294.5 mm (43.15 inches). Tropical monsoon climate with maximum temperature 24.6 ¬∞C and minimum of 0.5 ¬∞C are recorded. The water is reported to be alkaline in nature (ph value of 8.4‚Äì9.3). The lake receives flows from the surrounding catchment basin which comprises the hill slopes and springs. The hydrologic studies related to water balance and sedimentation was done using radioisotopes for estimating/measuring the various components of the inflow and outflow into the lake. Studies indicated that the subsurface inflow and outflow were significant ‚Äì ranging from 43 to 63% and 41 to 54%, respectively, of the total inflow and outflow, except in years of exceptionally heavy rainfall. The components of outflows were the surface outflow, the subsurface outflow through the springs on the downstream side and draft through wells for meeting the water supply of Nainital town and evaporation loss from the lake surface. The mean water retention time for the lake was computed as 1.16 years for the mean annual rainfall. Geology The Krol group of rocks, comprising slates, marls, sandstones, limestones and dolomites with a few small dykes intrusives, is the dominant geological formation of the lake's surroundings. The lake is deduced to have been formed tectonically. Balia Nala, which is the main stream feeding the lake is along a fault line and the subsequent streams align parallel to major joints and faults. 26 major drains feed the lake including the 3 perennial drains. The lake catchment has highly folded and faulted rocks due to poly phase deformation. Landslides are a frequent occurrence in the hill slopes surrounding the lake, which are steep. The slopes are highly vulnerable to landslides and mass movement due to various geological and human factors. Several landslides have occurred in the past (pictured) around the lake. Many settlements around the lake are located in landslide areas. Flora and fauna While the Nainital district where the lake is situated (in the middle Himalayan ranges up to , a temperate zone), is rich in flora (typical temperate climate plants) and fauna, the details of the flora and fauna specific to the lake and its surroundings recorded are the following.Introduction, Horticulture, Medicinal flora, Animals and Fishes =Vegetation= The trees and bushes grown in the region (lake's basin) with their botanical and common Indian names (in parenthesis) are reported to be: a) Quercus incana Oak (Banj); b) Aesculus indica (Pangar or Horse chestnuts); c) Juglans regia (Akhrot or walnut), d) Populus ciliata (Hill Pipal, a sacred tree); e) Fraxinus micrantha (Ash tree or Angu); f) Platanus orientalis (Chinar); g) Rubus lasiocarpus (Hisalu); h) Rosa moschata (Kunj or Musk rose); i) Berberis asiatica (Kilmora);j) Cupressus torulosa (Surai or Himalayan cypress); k) Rhododendron arboreum (Buruns); Cedrus deodara (Deodar); l) Salix acmophylla (Weeping Willow); and m) Pinus (Pine). The Aquatic Macrophytic vegetation recorded are the a) Potamogeton pectinatus, 2) Potamogeton crispus, 3) Polygonum glabrum, 4) Polygonum amphibium and Polygonum hydropiper (Water pepper). Several species of medicinal flora and horticulture plants have also been reported. =Aqua fauna= The fishes found in the lake are generally carps Mahseer, (the Hindi name of mahƒÅsir, mahƒÅser, or mahƒÅsaulƒÅ used for a number of fishes of the group), also hill trout and the mirror carp which breed several times during one spawning season during May to September. Two species of Mahaseer fish viz., Tor tor: The red finned mahseer and the Tor putitora: The yellow finned mahseer, a food fish which grows to varying sizes from 20 to 60 cm (7.87 to 23.62 inches) are reported. The three species of Hill Trout found in the lake are the Schizothorax sinuatus, Schizothorax richardsoni and Schizothorax plagiostornus. The imported fish bred in the lake is Mirror carp or Cyprinus carpio. Gambusia affinis also called Mosquitofish has been introduced in the lake as a biocontrol measure to control Mosquito larvae. =Fauna= Nine species of birds and nine species of animals have been recorded in the Nainital district. Water quality A scientific study indicates that the open drains feeding the lake introduce toxic substances from the catchment of the lake, particularly heavy metals which get adsorbed onto the suspended sediments, which in turn settle down in the bottom of the lake. A study of the risk assessment code has revealed that 4‚Äì13% of manganese, 4‚Äì8% of copper, 17‚Äì24% of nickel, 3‚Äì5% of chromium, 13‚Äì26% of lead, 14‚Äì23% of cadmium and 2‚Äì3% of zinc exist in exchangeable fraction which puts the lake under the low to medium risk category and infers that it could enter into food chain and also cause deleterious effects to aquatic life. This study provides the basic database to formulate guidelines for the dredging operations and/or restoration programmes in the lake.Metal fractionation study on bed sediments of Lake Nainital, National Institute of Hydrology, Roorkee, Uttaranchal, India The water quality studies carried out by the National Institute of Hydrology during 1999‚Äì2001 on physico-chemical parameters (pH, temperature profile, Secchi's transparency, dissolved oxygen, BOD, COD and nutrients), biological profile (density of population, biomass and species diversity of phyto, zooplankton and macrobenthos) and bacteriological characteristics have led to the conclusion that long-term limnological changes have occurred in the lake. Excess of nutrients inflow have contributed to the eutrophic conditions and the internal recycling of nutrients from sediments during water circulation has resulted in luxurious growth of phytoplankton. The lake is thus anoxic and has reduced hypolimnion, winter circulation, large phytoplankton and relatively lower animal population. Threats to the lake The problems facing the lake which were also listed in the plea in a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) before the Supreme Court of India in 1995 seeking court directive for redress measures could be summarised as below: * The lake is eutrophic to high nutrient accumulation and growth of phytoplankton. Algal blooms had caused loss of transparency. In spite of installing sewer lines to prevent sewage entering the lake still some effluents from drains, leakage and open defecation add to the eutrophication. * High Siltation resulting in reduction of lake depth (the depth of lake is reported to have reduced from its original depth of 27.97 m to only 19.6m.http://www.india- today.com/itoday/20010205/profile.shtml Lady of the lake, Profile: Aradhana Shukla), * Clogging of water channels (drains) in the surrounding hills because of encroachment, leading to poor drainage. * Landslides from the unstable hill slopes draining into the lake * Inadequate sanitation facilities for the poor section of society, commuters and tourists. Lake restoration The National Institute of Hydrology (NIH) of Roorkee who prepared a plan for the restoration of the lake, at an estimated cost of Rs 50 crore (about US$10 million), sponsored by the Ministry of Environment and Forests, Government of India, are also now guiding the restoration measures.Renewed focus on urban, rural water supply The Conservation and Management Plan evolved by NIH is not only lake centric but also proposes to tackle the immediate periphery of the lake which contributes an adverse impact on the lake. The \\"Nainital Jheel Parikshetra Vishesh Kshetra Vikas Pradhikaran\\", the Lake Development Authority notified under U.P. Special Area Development Act 1986 is a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) set up for implementing the restoration works. The restoration works that have been implemented or are in different stages of implementation are the following: * Limnological measures such as bottom aeration,company that proposed, installed and commissioned aeration work siphoning of hypolimnetic water, biomanipulation and limited sediment removal from the deltas of drains which lead to the lake. * Soil Conservation & Slope Stabilization measures in the form of soil conservation and watershed management activities in the catchment area of the lake, slope stabilization, Drainage line treatment, landslide scars to be treated with Coir geotextiles with gabion cross-barriers and proper maintenance and cleaning of drainage system * Provide 100% coverage of the town surrounding the lake with sewers and Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs) * Improved sanitation around the lake and in the catchment with new community toilets to cover all sections of the society, improved design of household toilets * Better solid waste management by disposing of the solid waste through a chute to the downhill outside the catchment, developing landfill sites is developed and in isolated habitations in the upper reaches of hills, introduce composting measures with support from NGOs. * Limited dredging of the lake, particularly near the deltas of drains that bring sediments * Fish Gambusia affinis introduced a few years ago to control mosquito larvae, the fish have started feeding on the larger zooplankton resulting due to scanty larvae population resulting in adverse impact on the lake water quality. This needs to be controlled by putting minnow traps in the lake and introducing some other fish species * The outflow from the lake is into the Balia Nala drain controlled by a set of sluices located at the lake bridge. The sluices which are old need renovation and replacement. The Balia Nala also needs slope stabilization measures to check landslides Landslide in 1880 * Shoreline Development and improvement of facilities at all important monuments and temples located in the periphery of the lake and providing avenue paths and roads * Improved Public Awareness and Public Participation programmes * The \\"Nainital Jheel Parikshetra Vishesh Kshetra Vikas Pradhikaran\\" could function better in a limited role as a promoter and a facilitator for developmental and commercial activities with jurisdiction extended to cover all four lakes in the district, as at present a plethora of organizations are functioning in the notified area such as Nainital Nagar Palika Parishad, Jal Nigam, Irrigation Department, Power Corporation, Forest Department and Fisheries Department who are directly involved with the lake. The Honourable Supreme Court of India in its judgment of 1995, in response to the Public Interest Litigation, gave the following recommendations which have also been addressed in the restoration measures mentioned above. > (i)Sewage water has to be prevented at any cost from entering the lake; (ii) > So far as the drains which ultimately fall in the lake are concerned, it has > to be seen that building materials are not allowed to be heaped on the > drains to prevent siltation of the lake;(iii) Care has been taken to see > that horse dung does not reach the lake. If for this purpose the horse stand > has to be shifted somewhere, the same would be done. The authorities would > examine whether trotting of horses around the lake is also required to be > prevented;(iv) Multi-storeyed group housing and commercial complexes have to > be banned in the town area of Naini Tal. Building of small residential > houses on flat areas could, however, be permitted;(v) The offence of illegal > felling of trees is required to be made cognizable.(vi) Vehicular traffic on > the Mall has to be reduced. Heavy vehicles may not be permitted to ply on > Mall;(vii) The fragile nature of Ballia Ravine has to be taken care of. The > cracks in the revetment of Ballia Nullah have to be repaired urgently. In the \\"India Today\\" magazine, Prasanta Rajan, a journalist, in a preamble to the particular interest shown by the Lady District Magistrate of Nainital in restoration works of the lake has very vividly described the lake in these words: > Look for the lake through the colonial windows of Pant House, a vintage > English bungalow on the hilltop, now submerged in wintry night, solitary > with a kind of Wuthering Heights mystery. Down below, the lake is a > laminated stillness, protected by seven never-sleeping hills. In the dead > darkness of Kumaon, this magnificence is a distant, partially lit vision, > less than real, as the hills of frozen memories make the lake a footnote in > water.

By 1562 he was a vicar and he worked under Latin bishops of Limassol, Andrea Mocenigo and Serafim Fortibraccia. By 1570 he was living in a monastery in Naples where he began writing his work Chorograffia. He also spend a lot of his time collecting ransom money used to buy the freedom of his relatives captured after the fall of Cyprus to the Ottomans (1571). In 1572 he moved in another monastery in Bologna. There he first published his work named Chorograffia. In 1575 he moved to Padua and there he designed his famous map to supplement his book. The map was dedicated to the last Latin Archbishop of Cyprus, Filippo Mocenigo. It was created by Giovanni Longo and was paid for by Stefano himself. In the course of his stay in Padua he also taught Greek at the University of Padua. During a trip to Rome he met the French ambassador and with his help moved to Paris in 1577. He lived in a monastery in Paris for ten years. Throughout his stay there he wrote and published many works. He was also involved in many literary circles which other Cypriots participated, including Enrico Caterino Davila.

It operates from two locations: a Drop-in Centre/Head Office in Central London (Victoria) and a residential home (New Belvedere House) in East London (Stepney). The charity's core business is averting and/or addressing crisis, particularly where it threatens to lead to homelessness.  History Veterans Aid was established in 1932 (designated originally as EFC ‚Äì The Embankment Fellowship Centre) as a direct response to the homelessness caused by poverty and unemployment among the ex-service community in London. It was founded by Mrs Gwendoline Huggins, whose husband was Adjutant of The Royal Hospital Chelsea from 1932‚Äì35. Deeply moved by the sight of men who had served their country sleeping on the capital‚Äôs streets and along the Thames Embankment, she decided to do something practical to remedy it. This led to the opening in January 1932 of H10, a canteen and recreation room for destitute ex-services personnel in Lambeth, South London.Veterans Aid History In 2007 the charity was renamed Veterans Aid, and its remit extended from homelessness to all issues affecting veterans in crisis. The charity's patron is the Dowager Viscountess Rothermere.  Main activities  In general terms, all the charity‚Äôs activities revolve around helping ex-servicemen and women in crisis. Specifically it deals with all the factors that contribute to crisis, especially those leading to homelessness. Because homelessness is considered both a cause and an effect of dysfunction VA's activities are diverse. The charity's aim is to restore veterans in crisis to a point where they can sustain productive, independent living. Veterans Aid's interventions are rapid and practical. In terms of rough sleeping its commitment is to 'No First Night Out'. The charity will provide food, new clothing and safe accommodation immediately to those seeking, and qualifying for, its help. Subsequent interventions can include counselling, addiction treatment and rehabilitation, debt management and, where appropriate, access to education, retraining or the acquisition of a new skill. Help is given to identify employment opportunities and, when veterans are considered ready, help is provided to source appropriately decorated and furnished homes.

He considered that he was restoring the original view of Marx and Engels, particularly in regard to the results of Britain's rule in India: namely that imperialism plays a progressive role in fostering the spread of capitalism worldwide, which is a prerequisite for socialism.For criticism of Warren's views, see Some commentators have likened Warren's ideas on capitalism, particularly his belief that the creation of a global market is required for the creation of a Communist society, to other thinkers, such as the Revolutionary Communist Party and Nigel Harris.For criticism of Warren's views, see Selected publications * References External links * 1993 review of Imperialism, pioneer of Capitalism * Article Discussing Warren's ideas, from the Alliance for Workers' Liberty * Marxism Mailing List: Bill Warren Controversy Category:1978 deaths Category:Communist Party of Great Britain members Category:British and Irish Communist Organisation members Category:Scottish communists Category:1935 births Category:Scottish non- fiction writers Category:Marxist writers ","title":"Bill Warren (communist)"},{"id":"20122409","text":"Station symbol is a subway station on the Fukuoka City Subway Nanakuma Line in Nishi-ku, Fukuoka in Japan.

Pumphrey (September 12, 1832 ‚Äì March 16, 1906) was the owner of a livery stable in Washington, D.C., and played a minor role in the events surrounding the assassination of Abraham Lincoln and its aftermath. John Wilkes Booth hired a horse from Pumphrey that he used to escape with after he assassinated the President. Early life and family James Pumphrey was born in Washington, D.C., to Levi Pumphrey and Sarah Pumphrey n√©e Miller, and was one of six children. Upon the death of his father, being the eldest son, James inherited a livery stable at the corner of C Street and 6th Street. James Pumphrey had two \\"common law\\" marriages and fathered seven children. He and his first wife, Margaret, had two children: Ida Elizabeth and James W., Jr. With his second wife, Mary, he fathered five children: Sarah, Mary, Josephine, Percival, and Edward. The day of the assassination Booth's escape route. Pumphrey's horse was killed by Herold while he and Booth were hiding in the woods prior to crossing the Potomac River into Virginia. Pumphrey was an acquaintance of conspirator John Surratt and it was Surratt who introduced Booth to him prior to the assassination. Pumphrey's stable was located near the National Hotel, which was Booth's Washington residence at the time. Booth had been hiring one particular horse, which he preferred, from Pumphrey.Kauffman. American Brutus. Pp. 176, 208 On April 14, 1865, after learning that Lincoln would attend that evening's performance of the play Our American Cousin, Booth went directly from Ford's Theatre to Pumphrey's livery stable to make arrangements for procuring a horse.Kunhardt, Twenty Days, pg. 31 Pumphrey informed Booth that the horse he usually hired was unavailable.Kauffman American Brutus. Pp. 208, 220 Therefore, Booth hired a different one, a swift little bay mare with a white star on her forehead and a black tail and mane.Kunhardt, Twenty Days, pg. 31 Booth told Pumphrey that he would be back to get it at around four o'clock that afternoon. At the hour agreed upon, Booth arrived at the stable. Pumphrey warned Booth that the horse was high spirited and she would break her halter if left unattended.Kunhardt, Twenty Days, pg. 32 Booth mentioned to Pumphrey that he was going to Grover's Theatre, the former name of the National Theatre, as he had to write an important letter. He added that he planned afterwards to stop for a drink and then take a leisurely ride.Kunhardt, Twenty Days, pg. 32 Booth did write a letter, but not at Grover's Theatre. He wrote the letter at the National Hotel; it was written to the editor of a Washington D.C. newspaper called the National Intelligencer. In the letter, he explained that his plans had changed from kidnapping Lincoln to assassinating him. In addition to signing his own name, he also added those of his co-conspirators: Lewis Powell, George Atzerodt, and David Herold. Later, Booth did get a drink at Peter Taltavull's Star Saloon located next to Ford's Theatre, but he definitely did not go on a pleasure ride. Instead, Booth approached Edmund Spangler, an acquaintance and stage hand at Ford's Theatre, with the request to hold the reins of the skittish mare that he hired, while he briefly attended to some business within the theater. This business was murdering Lincoln. After the assassination, Booth and Herold made good an escape to Virginia. Prior to crossing the Potomac River and while hiding out in some woods, Herold killed Pumphrey's horse along with his own because the horses were no longer needed. Temporary imprisonment In the turmoil that followed Lincoln's assassination, scores of suspected accomplices were arrested and thrown into prison by the United States Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton. Stanton vigorously pursued the apprehension and prosecution of the conspirators involved in Lincoln's assassination. All the people who were discovered to have had anything to do with the assassination or anyone with the slightest contact with Booth or Herold on their flight were put behind bars. Pumphrey, having supplied the get away horse, was jailed.Kunhardt, Twenty Days, pg. 187 Ultimately, the suspects were narrowed down to a group of eight prisoners‚Äîseven men and one woman‚Äîand, along with many others, Pumphrey was released.Kunhardt, Twenty Days, pg. 188 On May 15, 1865, Pumphrey testified for the Prosecution and described the horse he provided to Booth and the details of how that transaction came about. Pumphrey's last part in the events surrounding the assassination was to wait mounted on his horse for hours outside the Old Arsenal Penitentiary. He waited in the hope of having the privilege of carrying President Andrew Johnson's reprieve to Mary Surratt. While Pumphrey regarded Mrs. Surratt as wholly innocent and exhibited the deepest sympathy for her, no reprieve was to come. On July 7, 1865, she was hanged with three of the other conspirators. Later life and death Pumphrey continued to operate the livery stable until some time after 1900. The demise of his stable, like many others of the day, was caused by the advent of the automobile. On 16 March 1906, Pumphrey died in Washington, DC. He is buried in Congressional Cemetery. =Obituary= The following is Pumphrey's obituary in The Evening Star, Washington, DC.

Both nations are members of the G-20, Organization of Ibero-American States and the United Nations. History =Spanish colonization= Eva Per√≥n in Spain; 1947 In 1516, the first Spanish expedition to visit what is now Argentina was led by the explorer Juan D√≠az de Sol√≠s. In 1536, the first Spanish settlement was created in the R√≠o de la Plata basin. Since then, Argentina was formally incorporated into the Viceroyalty of Peru governed from Lima under the Spanish crown. In 1776, the Viceroyalty of the R√≠o de la Plata was created with the head of government placed in Buenos Aires. =Independence= In May 1810, the May Revolution where Argentina declared its independence from Spain. For the next eight years, Argentina, led by Jos√© de San Mart√≠n, fought Spanish troops for independence. In 1824, Argentina obtained its independence. In 1863, a Treaty of Peace and Amity was signed and thus established diplomatic relations between the two nations.Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Argentina (in Spanish) =Post independence= Since obtaining independence from Spain, diplomatic relations between the two nations have been stable. During the Spanish civil war, Argentina remained neutral and gave asylum to any Spanish citizen requesting it without regards to whether they were Republicans or Nationalists.La guerra civil espa√±ola y la sociedad Argentina (in Spanish) At the end of the war, Argentina maintained diplomatic relations with the government of General Francisco Franco. Maintaining diplomatic relations allowed for the first lady of Argentina Eva Per√≥n to visit Spain in 1947 and donate five million tons of food to the Spanish people. After the death of General Franco in Spain in 1975, Argentina entered a period of military dictatorship between 1976‚Äì1983. In 1982, Argentina invaded the Falkland Islands, also known as the Malvinas in Spanish. Spain recognized and supported the claims of Argentine territorial rights over the islands. In 2012, British documents were made declassified and stated that Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher feared that during the Falkland war, Spain would join Argentina by invading Gibraltar.El Pa√≠s: ¬øPuede Espa√±a atacar Gibraltar?

Spain warned against such a move stating that it would harm bilateral relations if such a move were to happen.Spain Cautions Argentina on Takeover of Energy Firm On 16 April, Argentina's President Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner announced the nationalization of YPF, to which Spain warned of a \\"clear and decisive\\" response.Spain Pledges Action Against Argentina Over YPF Seizure Since then, Argentina has recompensed the Spanish government and Repsol over the take over of YPF.Spain's Repsol agrees to $5 billion settlement with Argentina over YPF In the 2010s an Argentine court accused Antonio Gonz√°lez Pacheco, a former police inspector, of committing criminal acts during the Franco regime. He was sought for extradition by an Argentine judge in 2014. Mar√≠a Romilda Servini had called for the indictment. The request for extradition was refused by the Spanish High Court on the basis that the statute of limitations had run out on the accusation against him.

It is a Grade II listed building. The manor of Gisborough and the site of the dissolved Priory of Gisborough were acquired after the Dissolution of the Monasteries by Sir Thomas Chaloner in about 1558. He built a new manor house adjacent to the Priory ruins. His grandson was Sir William Chaloner, Bt. The manor house was demolished in the early 19th century when the family moved to Long Hull. In 1842 Admiral Thomas Chaloner inherited the estate and in 1856 created the present mansion house. The design of the hall is attributed to William Milford Teulon by Historic England, though his elder brother, Samuel Sanders Teulon is listed as the architect by the 1966 North Yorkshire edition of the Pevsner Architectural Guides. The house, in Jacobean style, presents a main south front of two stories and attics behind balustrades, with seven bays, the central and two end bays being canted and gabled. On his death without issue, the Admiral left the estate to his great-nephew Richard Godolphin Walmesley Long (younger brother of Viscount Long) who in 1888 changed his surname to Chaloner. He was created Baron Gisborough in 1917 and died at the Hall in 1938. The family lived in the Hall until the Second World War when it was requisitioned by the British Army. After the war, it was leased to North Riding Council as a nursing home. In 1972 it became a non-residential banqueting house and restaurant. In 2002, it was refurbished and extended by the family and now operates as a privately owned four-star Country House Hotel and wedding and conference venue with 71 bedrooms, the 2 AA rosette Chaloner's restaurant, G bar and bistro. The hall is Grade II listed on the National Heritage List for England as is the former stable block and its adjoining screen wall and gate piers to the west of the hall. The North and South lodges of the hall are also Grade II listed, as are the entrance gates and boundary walls to the south of the south lodge.

Elected to the Colorado House of Representatives as a Republican in 2008, Bradford represented House District 55, which encompasses northern portions of Mesa County and northern Grand Junction from 2008 to 2013. Biography =Early life and career= Born in Crookston, Minnesota and raised in Stephen, after moving to Montana and working at Yellowstone National Park at the age of 18, Bradford settled in Colorado, living in Denver, Greeley, and Aspen, before moving to Grand Junction, Colorado in 1981. Bradford has been married three times; she and her husband, Linton Mathews, have three children: Elizabeth, Meredith, and Preston. After founding several sewing-related businesses, Bradford founded ProSafe Products in 1987, a small business manufacturing fitted covers and garments for medical and dental applications. Her family opened a tree farm in 2006 on land near Collbran, Colorado. She joined the Women's Success Forum at the University of Denver Daniels College of Business in 1998, and was featured in the 1999 book Women Who Mean Business. She was a member of the Colorado Women's Economic Development Council from 1995 to 2000, and, in 1999, was appointed its chair by Gov. Bill Owens, and also sat on the Mesa County Revolving Loan Fund Administration Loan Review Committee. An amateur musician, Bradford has been treasurer for the Messiah Choral Society and directed her church's English Handbell Choir. She has served in various positions with the Republican party, and became House District 55 chair in 2002. Legislative career =2008 election= Bradford began considering a run for the house seat, meeting with Republican leaders, in 2007, as did former state senator Ron Teck. When Teck declined to run in August 2008, Bradford was left as the leading contender for the seat. She had no opposition in the August 2008 Republican primary, but faced incumbent Democratic Rep. Bernie Buescher in the November 2008 general election. Buescher was widely expected to become the next Speaker of the House if re-elected. Buescher's candidacy was endorsed by the Denver Post. Bradford ran a campaign focused on fiscal and economic issues, particularly attempting to link Buescher with Gov. Bill Ritter and their support of a controversial mill levy freeze. Buescher was targeted by flyers from Focus on the Family Action and other 527 groups during the campaign. Bradford was also criticized by outside groups as failing to support cancer screenings, a charge she rebutted by citing her own bout with cancer. Bradford aired television commercials responding to attacks from 527 groups, some of which were briefly taken off the air and revised after it was discovered that a photograph of Buescher, taken by a Grand Junction Daily Sentinel reporter and used in the ad, was used without proper permission. Bradford, running in a district with a 2:1 Republican voter registration advantage, received a late-minute boost from a visit by Republican presidential candidate John McCain on election day. As returns came in, Bradford and Buescher traded leads, with Bradford leading at the end of the night. By the following day, Bradford's lead settled at about 600 votes, more than 1 percent of ballots cast. Buescher conceded defeat the day after the election. After defeating Buescher, Bradford received a standing ovation when first meeting with the House Republican caucus later in the week. =2009 legislative session= For the 2009 legislative session, Bradford was named to seats on the House Business Affairs and Labor Committee and the House Local Government Committee, where she was the ranking Republican member. The first bill introduced by Bradford was a measure to update laws governing Colorado's statewide voter registration database into compliance with federal regulations. Bradford has announced her intention to support an expansion of the personal property tax exemption, a bill her opponent Buescher had promoted, and has publicly supported efforts to pass a version of Jessica's Law in Colorado, mandating stricter sentencing for sex offenders, and is expected to introduce a version of the legislation with Reps. Frank McNulty and Scott Tipton. =Drunk driving= On January 25, 2012, Bradford was pulled over by Denver police after making an illegal turn. After the officer smelled alcohol on her breath, Bradford admitted to police that she had been drinking. Upon administering roadside sobriety tests, the officer called a supervisor to receive advice. Denver Police later claimed that Bradford then invoked Article V Section 16, of the Colorado Constitution, which provides for legislative immunity: The representative, however, claims she never invoked legislative immunity; a claim which was substantiated by a House ethics committee. Bradford was issued a traffic ticket and her vehicle was impounded by Denver Police. Bradford later told a journalist that she drank three and a half glasses of wine during the night in question. She later delivered an apology on the House floor.Denver Post \\"Rep. Bradford apologizes to Colorado House for immunity controversy\\" January 31, 2012 =2012 election= Bradford did not stand for reelection in 2012 and was succeeded by Republican politician Ray Scott who won election with 58% of the vote.

Portugal has an embassy in Moscow while Russia has an embassy in Lisbon. The countries are the easternmost and westernmost in Europe, and they both have very good relations with each other. Both countries are full members of the Council of Europe and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe.  History  Full, ambassador-level, diplomatic relations between Portugal and the Russian Empire date back to 1779. Earlier, in 1724, Portuguese merchants appealed to Peter I to establish trading missions. Peter responded with appointment of a consul in Lisbon. There is no evidence, however, that the Lisbon consulate was actually established at that time. Trading between the two countries developed slowly, and the Russian consulate in Lisbon finally opened in 1769, headed by Jo√£o Ant√≥nio Borscher, a Portuguese-German banker from Hamburg. Borscher was not keenly interested in promoting Portuguese business interests, and trade between the two countries remained insignificant. In September 1779, Maria I appointed the former ambassador in the Netherlands, Francisco Jos√© Horta Macedo, as Portugal's ambassador to Russia based in Saint Petersburg. Catherine II responded with appointing Count Wilhelm Nesselrode as an ambassador to Portugal. These contacts resulted in the 1782 Treaty on Armed Neutrality and the 1787 Treaty on Commerce. In 1799, the two countries signed a defensive alliance that did not precipitate into direct military action. For most of the 19th century, relationships remained uneventful, gaining momentum in the last decade of the century when the Imperial Russian Navy regularly used Portuguese ports for replenishments. The crew of imperial yacht Tsesarevna in particular was hailed for their action in fighting the 1895 fire at the Portuguese Parliament. However, during the Russo-Japanese War in 1904, Portugal sided with the United Kingdom and refused to allow the Russian Navy access to its ports. After the February Revolution of 1917 in Russia, the ties between two countries were severed in 1918. Relations were not re-established until 1974 with the Carnation Revolution in Portugal and overthrow of the Estado Novo.Portal Diplom√°tico - R√∫ssia, Rep√∫blica Portuguesa (Portuguese)  See also  * Foreign relations of Portugal * Foreign relations of Russia References  External links  * Embassy of Russia in Lisbon Category:Bilateral relations of Russia Russia ","title":"Portugal‚ÄìRussia relations"},{"id":"20122548","text":"CCID Consulting Co., Ltd.

He was also the first president of the British Medical Acupuncture Society (1980), and the author of the first comprehensive English language acupuncture textbook Acupuncture: The Ancient Chinese Art of Healing first published in 1962. In 1995, he received The German Pain Prize. Mann, who was based in England, also lectured internationally on medical acupuncture.See also Acupuncture is demonstrated at Chinese Medicine seminar, The New York Times, 23 July 1972; p. 45. \\"During clinical demonstrations of by Dr. Felix Mann of London and Dr. Nguyen van Nghi....\\" Mann distanced himself from traditional beliefs in the existence of acupuncture points and meridians.  Criticism of basic acupuncture concepts  Mann distanced himself from traditional beliefs in the existence of acupuncture points and meridians. He stated in his book Reinventing Acupuncture: A New Concept of Ancient Medicine: : \\"The traditional acupuncture points are no more real than the black spots a drunkard sees in front of his eyes.\\" (p. 14) : \\"Many acupuncture points are in practice like McBurney‚Äôs point, in that both the position and size of the point vary enormously\\" (p. 14) And regarding meridians‚Ä¶ : \\"The meridians of acupuncture are no more real than the meridians of geography. If someone were to get a spade and tried to dig up the Greenwich meridian, he might end up in a lunatic asylum. Perhaps the same fate should await those doctors who believe in [acupuncture] meridians.\\" (p. 31) Regarding the whole meridian system: : \\"... the original, probably correct, observations were taken up by scholars who then processed something simple into something complicated, in their masterful, scholarly way. Possibly they wished the meridians in microcosm man to simulate the pathway of the planets in the celestial macrocosm and thus produced the truly amazing course of the meridians, coursing three times round the whole body. : \\"However, despite the fact that I criticise the present description of acupuncture points and meridians, it will be apparent that I could never have evolved my own ideas without the stimulus of the traditional structures.\\" (p. 36)  New concepts  In his later years, Mann introduced some new acupuncture concepts he found important. He regarded a significant part ‚Äì perhaps as much as 50% of the patients ‚Äì as strong reactors: : \\"These patients respond to acupuncture like magic. Their symptoms may be cured or alleviated within seconds or minutes of treatment, a treatment which involves only one or two needles and gentle stimulation.\\" (p. 41) Mann introduced a new acupuncture method that he regarded as stronger than traditional skin acupuncture: Periosteal acupuncture. (p. 91) This involves inserting the needles into the periosteum ‚Äì almost all the way down to the bone.

This is a Gaelic football only club, with no hurling played. The club is a member of the West Kerry division of Kerry GAA. They play their home games in the newly renovated surrounds of Pairc An Caislean located just outside the parish's main village of the same name. The club fields teams at all age groups from U10 through to Senior and has an excellent record at underage level with regular representation on county teams from U16 - U21. Many Castlegregory players have been honoured at Munster Colleges level with Tralee CBS and at Sigerson Cup level with various third level institutions. The success of the outstanding Miche√°l O'Shea with UCC stands out in the minds of most along with Se√°n Mahoney with ITT. History Football was played in Castlegregory long before the GAA was founded in 1884. The game of Caid was played in the parish of Castlegregory long before, and even after, the foundation of the GAA in Thurles in 1884. Caid itself seems to have been a combination of rough and tumble football and cross country running - the contestants being teams from neighbouring parishes. One such game took place between Castle and Cloghane in 1886 at Dowling's Big Field in Stradbally with both sides claiming victory. A replay finally took place 2 years later with Cloghane winning. A local balladeer recalled the game in a song called \\"The Kickers of Lios na Caol Bhuidhe\\" which contains the immortal line: \\" ..they'd kick all before them from here to Tralee\\" Another line recounts events when the game became a little too robust: \\"The referee, with his whistle, was up on top a tree\\".!!! The first official GAA club of the parish was known as Castlegregory Allen - in memory of William Allen, one of the Manchester Martyrs Allen, Larkin and O'Brien. The club took part in the first Kerry County Championship played in 1889 in which they met a team called √ì Breannan. After two draws, the second replay was played in Castle on 10 April, but the game was abandoned after O'Breannan refused to continue when Castle scored a disputed goal. However, as you would, both teams retired to a local hostelry and had a night of singing and dancing. The first recorded meeting of the club took place in October 1889 and Mr Thomas Moore was elected president and the officers elected with him were Silvester Egan, Hugh O'Flaherty. Michael Kelliher, John Fitzgerald, Eugene Foran and Michael O'Sullivan. John Foran and Thomas McCarthy were elected captain and vice captain respectively. Tom O'Flaherty from Fahamore soon became Honorary Secretary of the Kerry County Board and not long after Castle became a proper affiliated club Competitions Kerry GAA competitions are divided into two distinct branches - divisional and county. In divisional competitions, teams face off against their neighbours from within their own geographical area. In Castlegregory's case, this means that they play against other West Kerry clubs such as Dingle, An Gaeltacht, Lispole, St. Pats, Blennerville and fierce rivals Annascaul. County competitions involve matches against opposition from throughout County Kerry and are independent of divisional championships. Castlegregory also send players to form part of the West Kerry divisional team which competes in the Kerry County Championships at Minor, U21 and Senior levels. Club Foundations: Bord na n√ìg All of Castlegregory's underage teams take part in similar county Gaelic football and divisional competitions. Castle have regularly been strong contenders in their county league divisions, winning several titles at all underage brackets over the past 20 years or so, most notably a County Minor 3-in-a-row side in the mid 1990s. Senior 2009 Kerry Junior County Champions. 2009 Munster Junior Champions. Castle defeated Mountcollins of Limerick by a score of 1-20 to 0-4 on 13 December 2009. Great celebrations and speech making were seen in the village the night after the match especially by team trainer Ger Callaghan and team captain Adrian 'Sammy' Finn of the Maharees. Castle followed up this fine win in January 2010 by defeating Longwood of Meath in the All Ireland semi-final by a score of 1-16 to 0-8. Another fine win witnessed in Limerick by many who travelled from West Kerry for the game. Castle went on to meet Kiltimagh of Mayo in the final played on Valentine's Day, 2010. In a tight encounter the game finished level on a score of 0-12 to 1-9 after normal time so a 20 minute period of extra time was played. In extra time Castle came out on top and showed their superior fitness to become the first club from West Kerry to win an All- Ireland club title defeating Kiltimagh 0-15 to 1-14. In 2009 Castle also won promotion from Division 3 of the county league. Parish Leagues As a large parish - end to end is about 30 miles - comprising many sizeable townlands and villages, early Castle teams suffered from logistical difficulties when it came to the organisation of training sessions. To overcome this, a parish league was formed which pitted the best 15 from each or the larger townlands against each other. The main protagonists included teams from Cloghane, Stradbally, Aughausla, Camp, Maharees and Castlegregory. As the local population declined many townlands had trouble finding 15 players, to the point where the parish league was disbanded. In its place, we now have an annual once off game between the East of the Parish and the West of the Parish. These clashes take place every December, normally around St Stephen's Day. Often tough affairs, featuring a cameo or two from former greats who just doesn't know when to lie down, the matches usually draw a large crowd. Some things never change though and once the old scores are settled and rivalries renewed, it all ends with a trophy presentation and a pint in one of Castle's well known watering holes. Notable players Castlegregory has had some wonderful players through the years, many of whom never made it into a Kerry shirt but may well have been able to lay claim to one. Of those who did, Pat O'Shea and Tom Moriarty are two of the most notable. Both are featured in the book \\"Princes Of Pigskin\\", which chronicles the men and women who have made Kerry great. *Pat \\"Aeroplane\\" O'Shea *Tom Moriarty *Mick Moriarty *Kevin Maunsell *John Healy *Timmy Fitzgerald *Pat Dowling *Jack Dowling *Ger O'Donnell *Tom Kelliher *Micheal John O'Shea *Jason Wieboldt *Sean O'Mahony *Micheal O'Shea *Derek McNamara *Alan Lynch *Stephen Browne *Shane Henessey *JB Spillane *Thomas \\"The High Fielder\\" Rohan *Joe Scully *Alan Fitzgerald *Gavin o' Connor Roll of honour * West Kerry Senior Football Championship: (3) 1966, 1973, 1977 * Kerry Junior Football Championship: (2) 1974, 2009 * Munster Junior Club Football Championship: (1) 2009 * All-Ireland Junior Club Football Championship: (1) 2010 References External links *Official Castlegregory GAA Club website Category:Gaelic Athletic Association clubs in County Kerry Category:Gaelic football clubs in County Kerry ","title":"Castlegregory GAA"},{"id":"20122578","text":"Candela is one of the 38 municipalities of Coahuila, in north-eastern Mexico.

Completed in 1908, it spans Walney Channel, linking Barrow Island to Walney Island. The bridge carries the A590 trunk road, which has its western terminus on Walney. History Walney Bridge as it appeared in the early 1900s (decade) Talks began in 1897 to how feasible the construction of a bridge connecting Barrow to Walney would be. At the time, Walney residents were frustrated by the fact that they had to use a ferry to traverse the Walney Channel, and they also saw it as an opportunity to commemorate the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria. When the bridge was finally approved many companies fought for the building contract, with Sir William Arrol & Co. winning it. Construction of the ¬£175,000 (in that time) bridge began in mid-1905 and it was finally opened by Barrow mayor Mrs. T.F. Taylor on 30 July 1908. For 27 years Walney bridge was a toll bridge until 4 April 1935, when the late Queen Mother officially renamed it Jubilee Bridge to mark the silver jubilee of King George V of the United Kingdom, as recorded on a plaque on the bridge, and handed it to the townspeople. During World War II, the bascule bridge was lifted every night to ensure that anyone who made landfall on Walney was unable to reach Barrow by crossing the bridge and reaching its shipbuilding facilities.History of Walney Bridge The bridge is now over 100 years old, and in 2008 Cumbria County Council spent ¬£1 million on renovating the bridge and repainting it for its centenary celebration.Walney Bridge Centenary The bridge is not to be confused with Abbey Road's Jubilee Bridge, which is also in Barrow and is a Grade II listed structure.Abbey Road Jubilee Bridge =The Blue Bridge= Walney Jubilee bridge was often nicknamed by local residents the blue bridge in relation to its colour and to distinguish it from the other bridge situated on Barrow. These nicknames, however, were ended when in 2008 the bridge was painted gold and black. Centenary celebrations The bridge celebrated its 100th anniversary with significant renovation and a night of fireworks. In fiction The bridge was the link to the fictional island of Sodor, home of Thomas the Tank Engine et al. in The Railway Series books by the Reverend W. Awdry.

The official birthday of the United States Marine Corps is on 10 November 1775. That was the day when the Second Continental Congress established the Continental Marines with the following decree: Tun Tavern, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, is regarded as the birthplace of the Corps as the location of the first Marines to enlist under Commandant Samuel Nicholas, though it is disputed if a recruiting drive may have occurred earlier at Nicholas's family tavern, the .

The Corps was re-established on 11 July 1798, when the act for establishing and organizing a Marine Corps was signed by President John Adams. Celebration John A. Lejeune, author of Marine Corps Order 47. Prior to 1921, Marines celebrated the recreation of the Corps on 11 July with little pomp or pageantry. On 21 October 1921, Major Edwin North McClellan, in charge of the Corps's fledgling historical section, sent a memorandum to Commandant John A. Lejeune, suggesting the Marines‚Äô original birthday of 10 November be declared a Marine Corps holiday to be celebrated throughout the Corps. Lejeune so ordered in Marine Corps Order 47: Col Lewis B. \\"Chesty\\" Puller cuts the Marine Corps birthday cake in 1950, during a brief reprieve in battle during the Korean War. The first formal ball was celebrated in 1925, though no records exist that indicate the proceedings of that event. Birthday celebrations would take varied forms, most included dances, though some accounts include mock battles, musical performances, pageants, and sporting events. The celebrations were formalized and standardized by Commandant Lemuel C. Shepherd, Jr. in 1952, outlining the cake cutting ceremony, which would enter the Marine Drill Manual in 1956. By tradition, the first slice of cake is given to the oldest Marine present, who in turn hands it off to the youngest Marine present, symbolizing the old and experienced Marines passing their knowledge to the new generation of Marines. The celebration also includes a reading of Marine Corps Order 47, republished every year, as well as a message from the current Commandant, and often includes a banquet and dancing if possible. In many cases, the birthday celebration will also include a pageant of current and historical Marine Corps uniforms, as a reminder of the history of the Corps. Another modern tradition includes a unit run on the 10th. Marines are reputed to celebrate the birthday, regardless of where they may be in the world, even in austere environments or combat. In a more somber tradition, Samuel Nicholas's grave in the Arch Street Friends Meeting graveyard in Philadelphia is marked with a wreath at dawn by a group of Marines annually on 10 November to celebrate his role in the founding of the Corps.

The home was strictly religious, and his father turned to the Bible and the writings of Carl Olof Rosenius for daily guidance. The popular revival movement was a powerful influence on life in the large household with the many children. Wallin dreamt early of a career as an artist, his first artistic experience was an altarpiece by the artist Pehr H√∂rberg in √ñstra Husby church.Pehr H√∂rberg in Nordisk Familjebok, volume 12, 1910, page 277.

He worked as a store clerk and as a painter's apprentice in Norrk√∂ping 1893‚Äì1896, simultaneously attending lectures at a technical evening college. In 1896 he arrived in Stockholm and found work in the studio/atelier of Carl Grabow, a Swedish decorative painter of theatrical d√©cor. Carl Grabow had established a decorating studio in Kungsholmen in Stockholm. The Grabow CollectionGrabow Collection, at the Drottningholm Theatre Museum is unique documentary material for those wishing to study Swedish scenography of the late 19th century and the first years of the 20th century. Then Wallin continued his studies at the Technical Evening College (Tekniska skolan) in Stockholm under Anders Forsberg, who was a Swedish artist and art teacher and the teacher of freehand drawing at the Technical School. =Royal Academy of Arts in Stockholm: 1898-1904= In 1898 Wallin was admitted at the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts in Stockholm, where his fellow students included Karl Isakson, Ivar Arosenius and John Bauer. His teacher was among others Georg von Rosen. In 1903‚Äì1904 he studied briefly at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts and Acad√©mie Colarossi in Paris, where his teacher was the Norwegian naturalist painter, illustrator, author and journalist Christian Krohg. In 1902 Wallin received the Academy‚Äôs Ducal Prize for his oil painting \\"Kraka\\" and in 1904 he was awarded the Royal Medal for Portrait Painting. \\"Kraka\\" is a Norse mythology oil painting, of a little girl called Asl√∂g or also called \\"Kraka\\" or \\"Kraka meets Ragnar Lodbrok\\" (Hr√≥lf saga kraka, the Saga of King Hrolf kraki). David Wallin‚Äôs oil painting of \\"Kraka\\" has the dimensions of 223 x 149 cm. Kraka was a Norse princess. She caught the attention of the old king Ragnar Lodbrok thanks to her immense beauty. Before Ragnar took Kraka to his wife he wanted to bring her wisdom to a test. Ragnar invited Kraka to dinner and told her at the same time that she should neither be dressed nor undressed. Kraka survived the challenge by coming dressed in a fishing net. This is the story of the Norse fairy figure Kraka in the Norse mythology. Kraka is also known as the legendary Asl√∂g (Aslaug) in the Norse mythology. She is the daughter of Sigurd and Brynhild Fafnesbane, wife of Ragnar Lodbrok. Aslaug, Asl√∂g, Kraka, Kr√°ka or Randalin, was a queen of Scandinavian mythology who appears in Snorri‚Äôs Edda, the V√∂lsunga saga and the saga of Ragnar Lodbrok. Some other Swedish painters, who had earlier painted \\"Kraka\\", are M√•rten Eskil Winge (1825‚Äì1896)\\"Kraka\\" by M√•rten Eskil Winge, 1862 and August Malmstr√∂m (1829‚Äì1901).King Heimer and Aslaug by August Malmstr√∂m, 1856 =Engagement and marriage: 1905= David Wallin was engaged in springtime 1905 and in September the same year he married his fellow artist Elin Wallin, born Lundberg (1884‚Äì1969). The wedding was on September 14, 1905, in Sankt Nikolai kyrka in √ñrebro:sv:Sankt Nikolai kyrka, √ñrebro (The Church of Saint Nicolai in √ñrebro), Elin's hometown. After the wedding the couple made a combined wedding and study trip to Paris and London during the years 1905‚Äì1906. The couple eventually became the parents of seven children, five daughters and two sons, born in 1906 to 1924. =Artistic influences= Among Wallin's favorites in Paris were Jean-Fran√ßois Millet, Pierre Puvis de Chavannes and Gustave Moreau. Jean-Fran√ßois Millet was a French painter and one of the founders of the Barbizon school in rural France. Millet is noted for his scenes of peasant farmers, he can be categorized as part of the naturalism and realism movements. Pierre Puvis de Chavannes was a French painter, who became the president and co-founder of the Soci√©t√© Nationale des Beaux-Arts and whose work influenced many other artists. Gustave Moreau was a French Symbolist painter, a late nineteenth-century art movement of French and Belgian origin, whose main focus was the illustration of biblical and mythological figures. He was the movement's inspirational teacher, and he did much for the era. He was a professor at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts in Paris, he pushed his students to think outside of the lines of formality and to follow their visions. Wallin also became acquainted with the works of √âdouard Manet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, and other impressionists artists painting in the style of impressionism, an association of Paris-based artists. In London Wallin studied the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood (also known as the Pre-Raphaelites) and other groups, including James McNeill Whistler, who was an American-born, British-based artist. In London there were major collections of Pre-Raphaelite work in the Tate Gallery (Tate Modern or simply Tate) and Victoria and Albert Museum. Tate is Britain's national gallery of international modern art and forms and V&A; is the world's largest museum of decorative arts and design. David Wallin's own portrait \\"Portrait of my Wife\\" was shown at \\"Le Salon\\", Salon (Paris), at the Grand Palais des Champs-Elys√©es on Avenue Alexandre III in Paris. This portrait was a portrait with a sitting model in silver-grey colors which are outlined against dimmed masses of leaves. The avenue Champs- √âlys√©es was located adjacent to the Palais de l‚Äô√âlysee (√âlys√©e Palace) and the presidential palace, with its rounded gate, and the Grand Palais, was built in the late 19th century. The \\"Grand Palais\\" (Big Palace) was a large glass exhibition hall that was built for the Paris Exhibition of 1900. It was located in the 8th arrondissement of Paris. =Early subjects, early important portraits and other motifs= The subject matter of David Wallin's earliest independent paintings was associated with his native soil, for instance his \\"Family Estate\\" (1898). The most important among them, ‚ÄúThe Boy and the Migratory Birds‚Äù. The big painting reveals the influence of the French painter Jean-Fran√ßois Millet, but is clearly inspired by real life. A number of chiaroscuro portraits (an artistic technique) testify to his infatuation with Rembrandt during his student days at the Academy. Chiaroscuro is Italian for ‚Äúlight-dark‚Äù in art and is characterized by strong contrasts between light and dark, usually bold contrasts affecting a whole composition. It is also a technical term used by artists and art historians for using contrasts of light to achieve a sense of volume in modeling three-dimensional objects such as the human body. Chiaroscuro originated during the Renaissance as drawing on coloured paper, where the artist worked from this base tone towards light, with white gouache, and dark, with ink, bodycolour or watercolour. The French use of the term, clair-obscur, was introduced in the seventeenth century. In photography, chiaroscuro is often effected with the use of \\"Rembrandt lighting\\". Another motif was that of his wife and the mother-child theme, e.g. \\"Spring\\"(1905), an oil portrait of his wife in the Lill-Jans Forest in Stockholm. Several sketches of his wife show remarkable coloristic free and easy manners. Some charming oils include \\"Elin sewing\\" (1905), \\"Elin against blue sky\\" (1905), and \\"Elin in sunshine\\" (1906). In 1908, Wallin was awarded an Academy travel fellowship from the Academy's special fund, which was later extended for another year. The following year, in 1909, he received the Wohlfahrt Award. The scholarship was an award of financial aid for the student to further education. The criteria of the award was that the value and the purpose would further his artistic education. The awards allowed him to live, first in Italy, and then in France during the period 1908‚Äì1913, with only brief visits to his native country and to Spain. =Italy: 1908-1910= In Italy, Wallin was based in Rome and Florence during the years 1908‚Äì1910 together with his family, his wife and his three daughters at that time. In Rome the family stayed at Via Frattina. Numerous sketches and jottings in his sketchbooks testify to studies of Renaissance painting. His own compositional ideas often consist of vague sketches with one or more figures in a dimly suggested landscape, often romantic couples. In Rome he painted figures and street-life studies in addition to portraits, including several of \\"Mrs. Carin Lidman\\", born Thiel, later Mrs. Carin √ñstberg. In 1919 she married the famous Swedish architect and artist Ragnar √ñstberg, most famous for designing Stockholm City Hall. Ragnar √ñstberg was also Professor of Architecture at the Art Academy in Stockholm architecture school from 1922 to 1932. Wallin's portrait of Mrs. Carin Lidman shows a shimmering young womanhood which is reproduced in richly nuanced, scented colors. Wallin spent two summers at the Scandinavian Artists‚Äô colony (or Art colony) at Volterra in Tuscany, where he returned to a genre that he had embarked on at home, it was that of nudes in a landscape. His wife and children served as models. The best of these studies suggest the love of light playing on skin and greenery so typical of plein-air painting. Volterra is a small town 45 km southwest of Florence. =Paris: 1910-1913= In 1910 the family moved to Paris at Rue de l‚ÄôAbb√© Gr√©goire, a street in 6th arrondissement in Paris, where they were friends with, among others, the circle surrounding Erik Tryggelin (1878‚Äì1962),Erik Tryggelin with David Wallin's daughter Bianca Wallin (1909‚Äì2006), 3 years old, in Paris, 1912. Oil painting by David Wallin, it is only a memory from the time in Paris for the family Wallin. David Wallin's atelier in Humleg√•rdsgatan 23, Stockholm. Pencil drawing by Erik Tryggelin (1878‚Äì1962), dated July 10, 1918. a Swedish painter and photographer, and Gottfrid Larsson (1875‚Äì1947), a Swedish sculptor. Both of them also studied in Paris with scholarship. In springtime in 1912 Wallin and his wife Elin were the parents of four children, four girls born in 1906, 1907, 1909 and 1912, so it was natural that David's motifs often were the mother-child theme. Wallin was first introduced to modern contemporary painting in Paris, where he visited Andr√© Lhote and Kees van Dongen. Andr√© Lhote, (1885‚Äì1962) was a French sculptor and painter of figure subjects, portraits, landscapes and still life. Andr√© Lhote was influenced by Gauguin and C√©zanne and C√©zanne held his first one-man exhibition at the Galerie Druet in 1910. Nevertheless, 19th-century painting remained Wallin's preference. Kees van Dongen (1877‚Äì1968), usually known as just Van Dongen, was a Dutch painter and one of the Fauves. Fauvism is the style of les Fauves (French for \\"the wild beasts\\"), a short-lived and loose group of early twentieth-century modern artists whose works emphasized painterly qualities and strong colour over the representational or realistic values retained by Impressionism. While Fauvism as a style began around 1900 and continued beyond 1910, the movement as such lasted only a few years, 1904‚Äì1908, and had three exhibitions. Kees van Dongen gained a reputation for his sensuous, at times garish, portraits. Wallin studied modern works at the Gertrude Stein‚Äôs modern art gallery in Paris. Much of Gertrude Stein's fame derives from a private modern art gallery she assembled, from 1904 to 1913 when she lived in Paris, with her brother Leo Stein, an art critic. The Steins were important collectors and supporters of Henri Matisse's paintings. Wallin also studied modern works in the Edmond Auguste Pellerin‚Äôs collection of Paul C√©zanne‚Äôs painting collection and at exhibitions. Wallin exhibited several compositions at \\"Le Salon (Paris)\\" in addition to \\"Portrait of Elin\\", \\"Au Soleil\\", a nude on the shore, bathed in light, and \\"L‚Äôair du printemps\\", painted in Italy in 1910. Le Salon was the official art exhibition of the Acad√©mie des Beaux-Arts in Paris. \\"By the Wellspring of Life\\", too, is characterized by a diffuse setting into which he has introduced the movements of playing children and water. Wallin's palette is ascetic and suggests the influence of Puvis de Chavannes. Pierre Puvis de Chavannes was a French painter, who became the president and co-founder of the Soci√©t√© Nationale des Beaux-Arts and whose work influenced many other artists. \\"In the Beginning\\" is reminiscent of Eug√®ne Carri√®re's romantic visions of the mother-child bond. Eug√®ne Carri√®re was a French symbolist artist of the Fin de si√®cle period. Carri√®re was one of the leaders in the secessionist movement, which led to the founding of the Soci√©t√© Nationale des Beaux-Arts. \\"Resting Negro\\" was detect the influence of Paul Gauguin‚Äôs \\"The Spirit of the Dead Awakens\\". Wallin had copied details taken from Paul C√©zanne and Paul Gauguin. =Back in Sweden: 1913= The d√©cor of the wedding room at the Stockholm Court House After his return to Sweden in the autumn 1913 Wallin occupied himself with proposals for the d√©cor of the wedding room at the Stockholm Court House (Swedish: Stockholms R√•dhus) ‚Äì a Frieze of Life, now in the Lund University‚Äôs Archives for the Decorative Arts in Lund in Sweden (also known as Museum of Sketches for Public Art). Stockholm Court House is situated on Kungsholmen in Central Stockholm, Sweden. The building was constructed between 1909 and 1915. The d√©coration of the wedding room at the Stockholm Court House had been preceded of three competitions (1912‚Äì1914) which had attracted a big number of artists of the time. The fight for the decoration of the wedding room in the new Stockholm Court House became one of the most dramatic in the Swedish history of monumental art. Proposals for the wedding room also came from for instance the artists Isaac Gr√ºnewald and Georg Pauli. At last, the decorative paintings in fresco in the wedding room were painted by the artist, master house painter and ornamental painter Filip M√•nsson, an artist who had earlier carried out d√©cor paintings in the building. Other works Wallin also worked on the mother- child theme: portraits of young girls, children, and nudes. Much was a continuation of earlier ideas. His pictures of children are often characterized by a fragile fairy tale atmosphere, such as \\"A Little Bud on a Green Meadow\\" (1914) and \\"Story Time in the Garden\\" (1918). The nudes are based on the contrast of light and shadow, movement and rest, \\"Spring Holiday\\" (1914). In this big painting with the format 168 x 129 cm the artist shows something of his best nude painting. In 1999 the painting was donated to Moderna museet in Stockholm (the Museum of Modern Art, Stockholm). In 1914 David Wallin participated in the Baltic exhibition (Baltiska utst√§llningen), which was an arts and crafts exhibition held in Malm√∂ in the castle Malm√∂hus (now Malm√∂ Art Museum) during the period May 15 ‚Äì October 4, 1914. The Baltic countries of that time, Sweden, Denmark, Germany and Russia, were represented in the exhibition. The Swedish architect Ferdinand Boberg was responsible for the shaping of the exhibition. David Wallin exhibited at the Association of Swedish Artists‚Äô exhibition in Stockholm in 1917 in Liljevalchs konsthall in Stockholm, which was built in 1916. The exhibition devoted a separate room to Wallin's art. August Brunius was responsible for the most favourable reviews in which he proclaimed Wallin a very special force to be reckoned with within Swedish art, both in terms of his compositions and as the creator of a world of his own. He has an emotional world of his own which focuses with special intensity on the mother-child theme. We have to return to the classical painting of old to find a woman of the monumentality of \\"A Young Swedish Girl\\" or \\"Ragnhild\\" (created 1914, signed 1916), and to modern Norwegian art to find the equivalent of Wallin's moving studies of children. The spiritual element sometimes emerges too forcefully, but it never turns cheap or sentimental. The physicality, both of the phenomenon itself and of the painting, is ever present‚Äù. (August Brunius in Svenska Dagbladet, May 16, 1917). \\"Ragnhild\\", 73 x 79 cm, can be counted as a portrait, but it is sooner a composition, where the artist with inspiration and accuracy has brought about a fascinating evening lighting. \\"Ragnhild\\" was exhibited nine times, both in Sweden and abroad, from 1917 to 1952. In 1998 the painting was donated to the √ñsterg√∂tlands l√§nsmuseum in Link√∂ping (√ñsterg√∂tland County Museum). \\"The Salmon Fisherman\\" (1915‚Äì1919) constitutes an undisputed high point. The mood of nature is here combined with deep, but yet restrained, feeling, filled with grief. Wallin's preference for running water reminds us that in his youth he was an ardent admirer of Ernst Josephson. Two altarpieces and a self-portrait Two altarpieces from this period, 1919 and 1920, are in the churches in Valdemarsvik and Bure√•.

An important self-portrait is also from this period, \\"On the Balcony by the Sea\\" (composition, signed 1916). The self-portrait, 120 x 90 cm, was donated in 1999 by David Wallin's heirs to the Art Museum of Norrk√∂ping in √ñsterg√∂tland (Norrk√∂pings konstmuseum).Norrk√∂pings konstmuseum The portrait was created during a very active period of the artist's life, when he was inspired of magnificent nature in harmony with his inner emotionally flows. =1920s and 1930s= In the 1920s Wallin continued on the path of the free composition in which he strove for a synthesis of color and the play of light. His subject matter was usually nature, mother and child. David Wallin has exhibited in Paris, Vienna, Berlin, Munich, Dresden, Rome, Venice, Copenhagen, Budapest, Reval, Riga, Turku, Helsinki, Buenos Aires and in several U.S. cities, in Stockholm at Liljevalchs, Baltic Exhibition in Malm√∂ in 1914, solo exhibition in \\"Nordic Art\\" at Gothenburg Jubilee Exhibition in 1923 and solo exhibition at Konstakademien (Royal Swedish Academy of Arts in Stockholm) in 1926. G√∂teborgs Konsthall was built as an art exhibition hall for the Jubilee Fair of Gothenburg in 1923, Gothenburg Exhibition (1923).Jubilee Fair of Gothenburg in 1923 in Nordisk Familjebok, Uggleupplagan, 38, Supplement, 1926, Author Georg Nordensvan.

The museum building, at G√∂taplatsen in the center of the city, was created for the international exhibition in Gothenburg 1923 celebrating the city's 300th anniversary. The inaugural exhibition in G√∂teborgs Konsthall was the Jubilee Exhibition of Nordic contemporary art. The exhibition which took place between May 8 and October 15, 1923, was a muster of the Nordic breakthrough generation of modernism. Some of the paintings exhibited in David Wallin's solo Jubilee Exhibition in Gothenburg 1923 and in Stockholm at Konstakademien 1926 were: The big painting \\"Summer\\" (created 1914, signed 1923), 201 x 157 cm, was exhibited in 1926. The painting represents a standing nude woman, and it pays homage to the woman and it is representative for David Wallin's nude painting. Then the painting has been exhibited both abroad in Vienna, Budapest, Riga and in Stockholm at his big solo exhibition at Konstakademien 1931 and 1932. In 1998 the painting was also donated to the √ñsterg√∂tlands l√§nsmuseum in Link√∂ping (√ñsterg√∂tland County Museum), and the painting has now been deposit with the castle of Link√∂ping. At the same time the oil painting \\"Springtime in the forest\\" (1914‚Äì1925), 118 x 94 cm, was also donated to Link√∂ping (√ñsterg√∂tland County Museum). It is a composition with a forest landscape with two figures. An old man is sitting by a tree trunk and a young girl is going with springy steps on the forest road, showing the artist's typically philosophizing presentation of the motif. \\"Under the Tree\\", was exhibited 1926 and \\"Mother and Child\\" was also exhibited 1926. \\"Mother and Child\\" is in the collections of the Budapest art museum in Hungary, Museum of Fine Arts (Budapest) (in Hungarian: Sz√©pm≈±v√©szeti M√∫zeum). In 1926 the paintings \\"Arilds fishing village\\" (\\"Arilds l√§ge\\") and \\"Memories of youth\\" were purchased by Nationalmuseum in Stockholm (National Museum of Fine Arts in Sweden). During the 1930s David Wallin continued to devote himself to nudes, the relationship between man and nature, and the bond between mother and child. He painted \\"In the Summertime\\" (1932), and \\"At the Seaside of Arild\\" (1932). The latter earned him an Olympic Gold Medal at the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles in California in the United States of America. \\"Father at Ninety\\" (1929) represents a rare departure from these themes. =1932 Summer Olympics= The artwork which is getting admiring focus of attention is \\"At the Seaside of Arild\\" by the artist David Wallin from Sweden. The oilpainting won an Olympic Gold Medal in the class of painting in the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles in the Art competitions at the 1932 Summer Olympics. Norra begravningsplatsen in Solna, outside Stockholm. David Wallin won the Olympic Gold Medal in painting in Los Angeles, California, United States, in the 1932 Summer Olympics in the United States of America. Art competitions were held as part of 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, United States. Medals were awarded in five categories (architecture, literature, music, painting and sculpture) for works inspired by sport-related themes. David Wallin won an Olympic Gold Medal in the Art competitions at the 1932 Summer Olympics in painting of the Olympic Games for his oil painting \\"At the Seaside of Arild\\". The Gold Medal was won in competition with names like Isaac Gr√ºnewald and Bruno Liljefors. After the success with the Olympic Gold Medal Wallin was invited over to the United States to do a tour with a touring exhibition. He visited New York City, among other places.The Romanticist David Wallin received Olympic Gold Medal in art. \\"Romantikern David Wallin tog OS-guld i konst\\", article by Gunnar Hagberg in Norrk√∂pings Tidningar (NT), August 21, 2004.David Wallin, Kulturarv √ñsterg√∂tland, article by √Öke J√∂nsson. ‚ÄùOS i kultur ‚Äì Tavlan som gav olympiskt guld‚Äù, Popul√§r Historia, No. 5, 2002. Art competitions were part of the Olympic program from 1912 to 1948, but were discontinued due to concerns about amateurism and professionalism. Since 1952 a non-competitive art and cultural festival has been associated with each Games. =1940s and 1950s= The 1940s and 1950s brought new variations on the theme figure in landscape. He painted \\"On my Island in the Archipelago\\" (1940), \\"Salmon Fishermen in √Ödalen\\" (1943) and \\"Midsummer‚Äôs Eve\\" (1945). At the same time, he also devoted himself to pure landscape painting such as the pictures of Arild at the foot of Kullaberg in Scania. Arild was a fishing village and seaside resort as well as a resort for artists and writers. The coastline at Arild constitute a special landscape. It is a rocky coast with cobblestone flat rocks and rauk-like rocks. Arild was also an artist colony with famous names such as Gustaf Rydberg, Gustaf Cederstr√∂m, Fritz von Dardel, Olof Krumlinde, Isaac Gr√ºnewald, Nathanael Beskow, Richard Bergh and Herman √ñsterlund and more Skagen Painters, who gathered at Mother Cilla inn. In Kullaberg they were able to take advantage of the particularly strong summer light, reminiscent of that of Skagen. Wallin also made pure landscape painting with pictures of Omberg (Omberg, a mountain in western √ñsterg√∂tland along V√§ttern's eastern shore), Scania (Scania in the southernmost of Sweden), Bohusl√§n (Bohusl√§n on the west coast of Sweden), V√§stmanlands bergslag (the western V√§stmanland traditionally belonged to the mining district of Bergslagen), Norrland (Norrland in the Northland of Sweden) and Norwegian landscapes. The sketches of David Wallin, which are interesting from a painterly point of view and often exquisite, are part of his long and tireless career as an artist. Several canvases and smaller sketches show immediate coloristic inspiration and a freely poetic color which fuses reality and fantasy. In his landscapes as in his nudes the intense, romantic feeling transforms mountains, rivers, forests and meadows into outpouring of subjective moods. =Portrait painting= David Wallin's portrait gallery contains the features of many leading personalities within Swedish cultural life. Among the most famous early oil portraits, often chiaroscuro, are the portraits of the artist Axel Fahlkrantz (1851‚Äì1925) (1904),IDUN, 1905, Fahlkrantz, Axel; portr√§tt af David Wallin Portr√§tt f√∂rest√§llande Axel Fahlkrantz av David Wallin, IDUN 1905, Kvinnohistorisk tidskrift, Uppsala Universitetsbibliotek, under the heading \\"Vyer och reseskildringar fr√•n land och stad, beskrifningar √∂fver byggnadsverk, konstverk, filantropiska inr√§ttningar m.m.\\", article on page sidan 150 in the index. the poet and writer Erik Axel Karlfeldt (1904), the university president and architect Viktor Adler (1907),The Swedish architect Bror Victor Adler (1848‚Äì1910) (Viktor Adler) was the curator of the \\"Tekniska skolan\\" in Stockholm from 1886.

And he could, in fact, arguably be said to be ‚Äúthe last romantic in Sweden‚Äù, inasmuch as his approach to life often remained colored by the atmosphere at the turn-of-the- century. He strove to meld the intimate and the monumental in lyrically colored moods ‚Äì which meant that he gradually distanced himself from modern trends in painting. This approach was deliberate. Wallin never ceased stressing the gap that existed between his own ideals and much of what broke through in today's art. He wanted to remain faithful to these ideals. =Exhibitions and memberships= Wallin had about ten solo exhibitions in Sweden from 1926 to 1953 and about ten Swedish Group Shows in Sweden from 1905 to 1941 and numerous exhibitions sponsored by the √ñsterg√∂tland Art Association in various places in √ñsterg√∂tland. He had about twentyfive exhibitions abroad from 1906 to 1936. Wallin was a member of Swedish Artists‚Äô Association, The Artists‚Äô Club in Stockholm and Union Internationale des Beaux-Arts et des Lettres in Paris.

The film, Rogosin's first feature was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature. After the Second World War, Lionel Rogosin made a vow to fight fascism and racism wherever he found it. In 1954, he left the family business, the Beaunit Mills-American Rayon Corporation, in order to make films in accordance with his ideals. As he needed experience, he looked around for a subject and was struck by the plight of the men on the Bowery, and he determined that a portrayal of their daily lives on the streets and in the bars of the New York City neighborhood would make a strong film. Thus, On the Bowery served as Rogosin's practice film for the subsequent filming of his anti-apartheid film Come Back, Africa (1960). In 2008, On the Bowery was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\". Plot The film chronicles life on New York's skid row, which then was the Bowery, focusing on three days in the life of a small group of its residents. Its principal characters are Ray Salyer, a railroad worker who has just arrived on the Bowery after railroad work, and two older men: Gorman Hendricks, a longtime Bowery resident, and Frank Matthews, who collects rags and cardboard on a pushcart and dreams of escaping to the South Seas. Salyer wanders into a bar and is befriended by drunks he meets there. Among them is Hendricks, who steals his suitcase while Salyer is unconscious after heavy drinking.Erickson, Glenn. \\"On the Bowery (1957)\\" review, Turner Classic Movies (TCM), Turner Broadcasting System, a subsidiary of Time Warner, Inc., New York. Retrieved February 9, 2018. Salyer, without money or possessions, seeks day labor on a truck, and seeks shelter at the Bowery Mission. But he does not spend the night and returns to drinking. Toward the end of the film, Hendricks shares with Salyer a small amount of cash he had obtained. He tells Salyer that he received the money from a fellow who owed it to him. In reality, however, Hendricks got the cash by selling the items he found in Salyer's suitcase. Salyer is grateful and vows to use the money to buy a new shirt and pants, get \\"cleaned up\\", and escape life in the Bowery. The film concludes with Salyer's leaning on a Bowery lamppost. Production After serving in the U.S. Navy during World War II, Rogosin worked first as a chemical engineer and earned enough to finance his first feature. He was influenced by Robert Flaherty and Vittorio De Sica as well as the 1930 film adaptation of All Quiet on the Western Front. His original plan was to make a film about apartheid in South Africa. With $30,000 in financing, he decided to focus on the Bowery as a practice project. He researched the area for six months before filming and interviewed physicians at Bellevue Hospital. The original intent was to create a film critical of capitalist society and \\"what brutal world created these broken lives?\\" Writer Mark Sufrin, who collaborated with Rogosin on the film, said the idea \\"was to extract a simple story from the Bowery itself.\\" Rogosin got to know the street and the men intimately, befriending Ray Salyer as he was seeking day labor, and was delighted to find that his personal story was the one the filmmakers wanted to tell. He also met Gorman Hendricks, a longtime Bowery resident. While researching the film he met Sufrin and cinematographer Dick Bagley, who was recently part of the crew of Sydney Myers' The Quiet One. Bagley was himself an alcoholic, and died five years later. Rogosin also obtained the cooperation of the Bowery Mission, where one sequence was filmed. Shooting took place over a three-month period, beginning in July 1955. Bagley hid his 35 millimeter Arriflex camera under a bundle to shoot some bar scenes. Other filming was done from the back seat of a car. When filming began, the Third Ave El had ceased running but had not yet been torn down, so the dark shadows the El cast on the Bowery were still present, adding to the dingy atmosphere. The actors for the film were taken off the street, and spoke in their own argot, only guided what to say. Direction was aimed at \\"defining the action but not gesture or inflection,\\" Sufrin later said in an article in Sight and Sound. The filmmakers encountered many difficulties when making the film. Cast members were arrested and returned to the street with shaves and haircuts, making it hard to match new material with what was filmed. Some simply disappeared. There was interference by police. Shooting at night without lights was difficult, and the El was in the process of being demolished as the film was being shot. Editing of the film took six months, about double the amount of time it should have taken, due to Rogosin's inexperience. He hired Carl Lerner to complete the editing. Charles Mills, who had won a Guggenheim Fellowship, wrote the score. Cast * Ray Salyer (1916‚Äì1963) was born in Ashland, Kentucky and raised in North Carolina. He was a veteran of combat service in the U.S. Army during World War II. Salyer was offered a $40,000 Hollywood contract after the film appeared, but declined and soon disappeared. He died in New York City, possibly the Bowery, from the effects of alcoholism in 1963.Article The Village Voice, March 27, 1957Family reference at Salyer-L Archives * Gorman Hendricks (d. 1956) had been a newspaper reporter in Washington D.C., and once had gone to jail rather than disclose his sources for an article on speakeasies. He died in New York of cirrhosis of the liver just weeks before the film opened. Rogosin helped both men and took care of Hendricks' burial. Reception In September 1956, Rogosin became the first American director to win the Best Documentary award at the Venice Film Festival with On the Bowery, but it was shunned at the festival by Clare Boothe Luce, the American ambassador to Italy.Crowther, Bosley (1957). \\"Screen: 'On the Bowery'; Documentary at 55th Street Playhouse Offers Sordid Lecture on Temperance\\", review, The New York Times, March 19, 1957. Retrieved February 9, 2018. Distribution was extremely difficult because of the downbeat subject matter and a dismissive review by influential New York Times critic Bosley Crowther. When it was opened in New York in March 1957, Crowther panned the film as \\"a dismal exposition.\\" While praising the photography, editing and music, Crowther said the story was \\"a shade too fictional to be believed,\\" and called the film \\"merely a good montage of good photographs of drunks and bums, scrutinized and listened to ad nauseam. The film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature and released in the U.S. in 1957.  Legacy  On the Bowery has come to be viewed as an incisive examination of alcoholism, and established Rogosin's reputation as an independent filmmaker. Among the independent filmmakers influenced by Rogosin and the film were John Cassavetes and Shirley Clarke, who employed many of his techniques in filming The Cool World (1963). Years later in a review of the 2015 film Mekko, On the Bowery, along with the 1961 film The Exiles, was mentioned in a comparison of Mekko by Variety's film critic Dennis Harvey. They were referred to as being two classic films set on skid row.Variety, September 11, 2015.

For people, energy is an overwhelming need, and as a scarce resource, it has been an underlying cause of political conflicts and wars. The gathering and use of energy resources can be harmful to local ecosystems and may have global outcomes. Interdisciplinary fields As an interdisciplinary science Energy technology is linked with many interdisciplinary fields in sundry, overlapping ways. * Physics, for thermodynamics and nuclear physics * Chemistry for fuel, combustion, air pollution, flue gas, battery technology and fuel cells. * Electrical engineering * Engineering, often for fluid energy machines such as combustion engines, turbines, pumps and compressors. * Geography, for geothermal energy and exploration for resources. * Mining, for petrochemical and fossil fuels. * Agriculture and forestry, for sources of renewable energy. * Meteorology for wind and solar energy. * Water and Waterways, for hydropower. * Waste management, for environmental impact. * Transportation, for energy-saving transportation systems. * Environmental studies, for studying the effect of energy use and production on the environment, nature and climate change. * (Lighting Technology), for Interior and Exterior Natural as well as Artificial Lighting Design, Installations, and Energy Savings * (Energy Cost/Benefit Analysis), for Simple Payback and Life Cycle Costing of Energy Efficiency/Conservation Measures Recommended Electrical engineering High-voltage lines for the long distance transportation of electrical energy Electric power engineering deals with the production and use of electrical energy, which can entail the study of machines such as generators, electric motors and transformers. Infrastructure involves substations and transformer stations, power lines and electrical cable. Load management and power management over networks have meaningful sway on overall energy efficiency. Electric heating is also widely used and researched. Thermodynamics Thermodynamics deals with the fundamental laws of energy conversion and is drawn from theoretical Physics. Thermal and chemical energy grate for a wood fire Thermal and chemical energy are intertwined with chemistry and environmental studies. Combustion has to do with burners and chemical engines of all kinds, grates and incinerators along with their energy efficiency, pollution and operational safety. Exhaust gas purification technology aims to lessen air pollution through sundry mechanical, thermal and chemical cleaning methods. Emission control technology is a field of process and chemical engineering. Boiler technology deals with the design, construction and operation of steam boilers and turbines (also used in nuclear power generation, see below), drawn from applied mechanics and materials engineering. Energy conversion has to do with internal combustion engines, turbines, pumps, fans and so on, which are used for transportation, mechanical energy and power generation. High thermal and mechanical loads bring about operational safety worries which are dealt with through many branches of applied engineering science. Nuclear energy A steam turbine. Nuclear technology deals with nuclear power production from nuclear reactors, along with the processing of nuclear fuel and disposal of radioactive waste, drawing from applied nuclear physics, nuclear chemistry and radiation science. Nuclear power generation has been politically controversial in many countries for several decades but the electrical energy produced through nuclear fission is of worldwide importance. There are high hopes that fusion technologies will one day replace most fission reactors but this is still a research area of nuclear physics. Renewable energy Solar (photovoltaic) panels at a military base in the US. Renewable energy has many branches. =Solar power= * Photovoltaic power draws electricity from solar radiation through solar cells, either locally or in large photovoltaic power plants and uses semiconductor technology. * Solar heating uses solar panels which gather heat from sunlight to heat buildings and water. * Solar thermal power produces electricity by converting solar heat. =Wind power= Wind turbines on Inner Mongolian grassland Wind turbines draw energy from atmospheric currents and are designed using aerodynamics along with knowledge taken from mechanical and electrical engineering. =Geothermal= Where it can be had, geothermal energy is used for heating and electricity. =Hydropower= Pelton water turbines in Germany. Hydropower draws mechanical energy from rivers, ocean waves and tides. Civil engineering is used to study and build dams, tunnels, waterways and manage coastal resources through hydrology and geology. A low speed water turbine spun by flowing water can power an electrical generator to produce electricity. =Bioenergy= Bioenergy deals with the gathering, processing and use of biomasses grown in biological manufacturing, agriculture and forestry from which power plants can draw burning fuel. Ethanol, methanol (both controversial) or hydrogen for fuel cells can be had from these technologies and used to generate electricity. =Enabling technologies= Heat pumps and Thermal energy storage are classes of technologies that can enable the utilization of renewable energy sources that would otherwise be inaccessible due to a temperature that is too low for utilization or a time lag between when the energy is available and when it is needed. While enhancing the temperature of available renewable thermal energy, heat pumps have the additional property of leveraging electrical power (or in some cases mechanical or thermal power) by using it to extract additional energy from a low quality source (such as seawater, lake water, the ground, the air, or waste heat from a process). Thermal storage technologies allow heat or cold to be stored for periods of time ranging from hours or overnight to interseasonal, and can involve storage of sensible energy (i.e. by changing the temperature of a medium) or latent energy (i.e. through phase changes of a medium, such between water and slush or ice). Short-term thermal storages can be used for peak-shaving in district heating or electrical distribution systems. Kinds of renewable or alternative energy sources that can be enabled include natural energy (e.g. collected via solar-thermal collectors, or dry cooling towers used to collect winter's cold), waste energy (e.g. from HVAC equipment, industrial processes or power plants), or surplus energy (e.g. as seasonally from hydropower projects or intermittently from wind farms). The Drake Landing Solar Community (Alberta, Canada) is illustrative. borehole thermal energy storage allows the community to get 97% of its year-round heat from solar collectors on the garage roofs, which most of the heat collected in summer.Wong, Bill (June 28, 2011), \\"Drake Landing Solar Community\\" , IDEA/CDEA District Energy/CHP 2011 Conference, Toronto, pp. 1‚Äì30, retrieved 21 April 2013Wong B., Thornton J. (2013). Integrating Solar & Heat Pumps. Renewable Heat Workshop. Types of storages for sensible energy include insulated tanks, borehole clusters in substrates ranging from gravel to bedrock, deep aquifers, or shallow lined pits that are insulated on top. Some types of storage are capable of storing heat or cold between opposing seasons (particularly if very large), and some storage applications require inclusion of a heat pump. Latent heat is typically stored in ice tanks or what are called phase-change materials (PCMs).

They are thought to be involved in mRNA trans- splicing. SmY RNAs are about 70‚Äì90 nucleotides long and share a common secondary structure, with two stem-loops flanking a consensus binding site for Sm protein. Sm protein is a shared component of spliceosomal snRNPs. Phylogenetic distribution of known and predicted SmY RNA genes, and the number of genes and pseudogenes found in each species. Gene numbers are based on computational analysis (using the program Infernal) of genome assemblies; in some cases these are draft genomes that may be incomplete. SmY RNAs have been found in nematodes of class Chromadorea, which includes the most commonly studied nematodes (such as Caenorhabditis, Pristionchus, and Ascaris), but not in the more distantly related Trichinella spiralis in class Dorylaimia. The number of SmY genes in each species varies, with most Caenorhabditis and Pristionchus species having 10‚Äì26 related paralogous copies, while other nematodes have 1‚Äì5. Discovery The first SmY RNA was discovered in 1996 in purified Ascaris lumbricoides spliceosome preparations, as was another called SmX RNA that is not detectably homologous to SmY. Twelve SmY homologs were identified computationally in Caenorhabditis elegans, and ten in Caenorhabditis briggsae. Several transcripts from these SmY genes were cloned and sequenced in a systematic survey of small non-coding RNA transcripts in C. elegans. A systematic survey of 2,2,7-trimethylguanosine (TMG) 5‚Ä≤ capped transcripts in C.elegans using anti TMG antibodies identified two TMG capped SmY transcripts. Sequence analysis of the potential Sm binding sites in these transcripts indicated the SmY, U5 snRNA, U3 snoRNA and the spliced leader RNAs transcripts (SL1 and SL2) all contain a very similar consensus SM binding sequence (AAU4‚Äì5GGA). The predicted SM binding sites identified in the U1, U2 and U4 snRNA transcripts varied from this consensus. Function In C. elegans, SmY RNAs copurify with spliceosome and with Sm, SL75p, and SL26p proteins, while the better-characterized C. elegans SL1 trans-splicing snRNA copurifies in a complex with Sm, SL75p, and SL21p (a paralog of SL26p). Loss of function of either SL21p or SL26p individually causes only a weak cold- sensitive phenotype, whereas knockdown of both is lethal, as is a SL75p knockdown. Based on these results, the SmY RNAs are believed to have a function in trans-splicing.

Career Legault is a three-time Canadian individual speedway champion; winning in 2003, 2004 and 2006. He began his British speedway career in 2005, with Premier League team the Sheffield Tigers where he recorded a 5.80 average in his first season. Legault remained with Sheffield in 2006 and the team reached the Premier League play-off final and the final of the Premier Trophy, but lost both finals to the King's Lynn Stars. Legault switched to the Mildenhall Fen Tigers for 2007 and recorded an improved average of 8.77 by the end of the season. He also reached the final round of the 2008 Speedway Grand Prix qualifiers at Vojens, Denmark, but fell during his first heat and fractured his right wrist. In 2008, Legault moved to the Birmingham Brummies. However, in only Birmingham's second meeting of the season he was involved in a crash and suffered a broken fibula. It was thought that Legault would miss the remainder of the season, but he returned 12 weeks later to take part in a 2009 Speedway Grand Prix qualification round. He resumed racing for Birmingham in July, but broke his jaw and was ruled out for the rest of the season after he was involved in a crash at Sheffield on 21 August. Legault moved up to the Elite League in 2009 after signing a one-year loan deal with 2008 champions the Poole Pirates.

He currently holds the position of Associate Professor in the Faculty of Life and Social Sciences at Swinburne University of Technology in Melbourne, Australia. Biography Gare is the son of Frank Gare ISO,see National Library of Australia: \\"Papers of Frank Gare\\" former Commissioner for Native Welfare and Regional Director of Aboriginal Affairs in Western Australia, and Nene Gare,see National Library of Australia: \\"Papers of Nene Gare\\" author of The Fringe Dwellerssee National Library of Australia entry, Nene Gare: The Fringe Dwellers, Sun Books, Melbourne, 1966. and other novels. He is also the brother of Shelley Gare, an Australian author and journalist. Gare attended Applecross Senior High School, then graduated from the University of Western Australia with a BA (Hons) in philosophy. He then wrote his PhD, (\\"Science, Process Philosophy and the Image of Man: the metaphysical foundations for a critical social science\\"PhD thesis), at Murdoch University in which he formed his version of process metaphysics. On the basis of this he won a Postdoctoral Fulbright Fellowship to Boston University. Gare has taught at Murdoch University, University of Queensland, Curtin University and Swinburne University. In 2006 he was a Keynote Speaker to the 6th International Whitehead Conference at Salzburg University, Austria, delivering a paper entitled: \\"Reviving the Radical Enlightenment\\".International Whitehead Conference 3‚Äì6 July 2006, University of Salzburg , see Keynotes/Abstracts/Arran Gare. More recently he has aligned himself with Chinese environmentalists in the quest to create a global ecological civilisation. Research Gare's work is mainly in environmental philosophy, the history and philosophy of science, philosophy of culture and the metaphysics of process philosophy. In 1983 with Robert Elliot he published Environmental Philosophy, one of the first anthologies in this field. In 1993 he published Nihilism Incorporated: European Civilization and Environmental Destruction and Beyond European Civilization: Marxism, Process Philosophy and the Environment, and then in 1995 Postmodernism and the Environmental Crisis. In these works he attempted to explain the ascendance, world domination and environmental destructiveness of European civilisation, the failure of orthodox Marxism as practised in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe to provide a real alternative to this, and the ineffectuality of deconstructive postmodernism in the face of the ecological crisis confronting humanity, while offering a different path into the future based on a synthesis of process metaphysics, neo-Aristotelian ethics, neo-Hegelian political philosophy and eco-Marxism. In 1996 he published Nihilism Inc.: Environmental Destruction and the Metaphysics of Sustainability. In more recent work Gare has published in the fields of narratology, hermeneutics, semiotics, complexity theory, theoretical biology, human ecology and philosophical anthropology, Schelling's philosophy, Chinese philosophy and Christopher Alexander's theories of architecture, and called for a revival of the Radical Enlightenment as the true heir of the Renaissance struggle for democracy and for the creation of an ecological civilisation as a new world order based on a new relationship between humanity and nature. More specifically, he has been concerned to revive and reformulate on naturalistic foundations the ethics and political philosophy of the liberal socialists inspired by T.H. Green, develop more adequate theoretical foundations for human ecology and ecological economics to provide an alternative to neo-classical economics as the core discipline for formulating public policy, and develop a form of retrospective path analysis as an alternative to cost-benefit analysis as a framework for formulating such policy. These ideas have been synthesised in his book The Philosophical Foundations of Ecological Civilization: A manifesto for the future published in 2016. Such work revives the traditional ambitions of philosophy, and as such, is a challenge to philosophy's current marginalization. In defence of his conception of philosophy he has worked to revive the tradition of speculative naturalism, an outcome of which has been the publication in 2017 of the anthology For a New Naturalism, co-edited with Wayne Hudson. A critical review of his work has been made from within the domain of process philosophy by McLaren.Glenn McLaren, 'Unifying Process Philosophy: Secular Metaphysics and Fragmentary Influences‚Äô, Applied Process Thought I: Initial Explorations in Theory and Research.

R. Williams. He was best known for his long- run daily syndicated panel Out Our Way. As noted by Coulton Waugh in his 1947 book The Comics, anecdotal evidence indicated that more Williams' cartoons were clipped and saved than were other newspaper comics. A newspaper promotion of 1930 compared him to poets Eugene Field and James Whitcomb Riley. Early life Williams was born in Nova Scotia, Canada. When he was young, his family moved to Detroit, and he was 15 when he dropped out of school to work as an apprentice machinist in Ohio, soon relocating to Arkansas and Oklahoma, where he drifted about, sometimes working on ranches during a six-year period. He spent three years in the U.S. Cavalry.Lambiek Comiclopedia Returning to Ohio, he married Lida Keith and settled into a steady job with a crane manufacturing firm, where he drew covers for the company's catalog. During his spare time, he created cartoons depicting ranch life and machine shop workers. He started submitting his work to newspaper syndicates, eventually receiving an offer from Newspaper Enterprise Association.University of Wyoming American Heritage Center: Rural Images Out Our Way begins Out Our Way first appeared in newspapers on March 20, 1922. The single-panel series introduced a variety of characters, including the cowboy Curly and ranch bookkeeper Wes, and soon led to a Sunday strip, Out Our Way with the Willits. His assistants on the strip were George Scarbo and Neg Cochran. Williams used Out Our Way as an umbrella title for several alternating series. These had recurring characters, such as Bull of the Woods about the boss of a machine shop and the small town family life in Why Mothers Get Gray. Don Markstein, in describing Williams' settings and themes, lists the other series subtitles: 200px With 40 million readers by 1930, Williams was so successful that he bought his own ranch in Prescott, Arizona, where he rode about on his horse Lizard. He later moved to Pasadena, California. His cartoons and strips continued through the next two decades, appearing in more than 700 newspapers at their peak. They were collected in several books, and some were reprinted in Popular Comics. In 1956, the Worry Wart starred in a single issue of his own comic book, a Dell Four-Color titled Out Our Way with the Worry Wart. The following year, Williams died at age 69. Out Our Way was continued by Neg Cochran, Paul Gringle, Ed Sullivan and others until 1977. Publisher Leonard G. Lee of Canada's Algrove Publishing has reprinted Williams' work in more than a dozen volumes of their Classic Reprint Series. In addition to Out Our Way Sampler: 20s, 30s & 40s (2005), their catalog includes U.S. Cavalry Cartoons, The Bull of the Woods (six volumes) and Classic Cowboy Cartoons (four volumes).

Completed in 1840, the statue was soon exhibited in the Rotunda of the United States Capitol and then moved to the Capitol's east lawn in 1843. Since 1964 it has been in the National Museum of American History. Horatio Greenough based Enthroned Washington on Phidias' great statue of Zeus Olympios, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World and destroyed in Late Antiquity.  Description  The seated and sandal wearing Washington gazes sternly ahead. He is bare-chested and his right arm and hand gesture with upraised index finger toward Heaven. His left palm and forearm cradle a sheathed sword, hilt forward, symbolizing Washington turning over power to the people at the conclusion of the American Revolutionary War. The representation of Washington in Roman clothing is indicative of Neoclassical art. The original Latin inscription, on the back of the statue reads: SIMULACRUM ISTUD AD MAGNUM LIBERTATIS EXEMPLUM NEC SINE IPSA DURATURUM HORATIUS GREENOUGH FACIEBAT and translates as: \\"Horatio Greenough made this image as a great example of freedom, which will not survive without freedom itself.\\"  History  George Washington (Photo, ca. 1899) On July 14, 1832, the U.S. Congress commissioned Greenough to create a statue of Washington for display in the U.S. Capitol rotunda. When the marble statue arrived in Washington, D.C. from Italy on July 31, 1841 it immediately generated controversy and criticism on its installation in the rotunda in December 1841. Many found the sight of a half-naked Washington offensive, even comical. Because of the sculpture's weight and the dim light inside the rotunda, the statue was relocated to a pedestal the east lawn of the Capitol in 1843. Disapproval continued and some joked that Washington was desperately reaching for his clothes, then on exhibit at the Patent Office several blocks to the north. The statue was brought back indoors to the Smithsonian Castle, after Congress authorized its transfer by joint resolution on May 22, 1908. It remained there until 1964. It was then moved to the new Museum of History and Technology (now the National Museum of American History). The statue has been exhibited on the second floor of the museum since then.  Popular culture references  The demigod-like pose of Washington is portrayed in Dan Brown's best-selling novel The Lost Symbol (2009), in which the author describes a hypothesis according to which Washington and the other founding fathers decorated the national capital full of Freemason and other occult symbols. The statue appears near the beginning of the 2013 first person shooter, BioShock Infinite, set in an alternate 1912 where Washington, Benjamin Franklin, and Thomas Jefferson are worshiped by the inhabitants of the floating city of Columbia.

Social Security Administration. nicknamed Motl or Motyl, was a 12-year-old Hasidic Jewish boy from Brooklyn, New York, United States. After a brain tumor stopped his brain functioning, doctors declared him legally dead on November 4, 2008, but his parents refused to accept the legal definition of death on religious grounds because his heart was still beating. The case became the center of a widely publicized, but never resolved, legal dispute between his parents, Eluzer and Miriam Brody, and Children's National Medical Center, Washington, D.C. Position of the hospital According to an affidavit filed by one of his doctors, Brody's condition had deteriorated beyond a persistent vegetative state. He was pronounced brain dead and was unable to breathe on his own without the help of a ventilator. His heart beat on its own, but he required medication to maintain his blood pressure (normally a function of the brain stem). As a result, Brody's physicians wished to remove the boy from life support, as they believed he was brain dead, which is the legal definition of death in the District of Columbia. Position of the parents Although there is no consensus about what defines death in Jewish law, the parents are followers of rabbi Chaim Jacob Tauber, chief rabbinical judge of the Bobov Hasidic community in Brooklyn and they reject brain death as an indicator of death. They wanted their son to remain on a ventilator as long as his heart was beating. As the case deals with the definition of death, rather than the value of living in a permanent vegetative state, it was far more like that of Jesse Koochin than that of Terri Schiavo. Legal proceedings The hospital asked Judge William Jackson of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia to affirm the doctors' decision that the boy could be taken off life support. Brody's parents challenged the hospital's assertion that Brody was dead, and claimed that doing so would be a violation of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. The judge heard initial arguments on November 10, but delayed issuing a decision until further hearings could be held. The family and the hospital also released a joint statement where they expressed their mutual hope for an out of court decision. Cardiac death Brody's heart stopped on November 15, 2008, and he was buried on November 16. The state of New York ruled November 4 his date of death. The court case was never resolved.

Toussaint-Henry-Joseph Fafchamps (1783-1868), sometimes spelled Fafschamps, was a Belgian Army captain. In 1851, with the Belgian gunsmith Joseph Montigny and the Fusnot company, he developed what is sometimes considered the first machine gun in history, 10 years before the advent of the Gatling gun. Specifications Fafchamps made a prototype of his machine, as well as drawings, which were remitted to Montigny. The Fafschamps gun was a manually fired 50-barrels volley gun using needle fire and paper cartridges, and was only intended as a stationary artillery piece for defensive fortifications. Fafchamps named it the \\"carabine multiple\\". Legacy Joseph Montigny further improved the weapon, completing the transportable 37-barrels Montigny mitrailleuse (also known as the \\"Fafschamps- Montigny mitrailleuse\\") in 1863. From 1859, Joseph Montigny proposed his design to Napoleon III, which led to the development of the French Reffye mitrailleuse, designed by Jean-Baptiste Verch√®re de Reffye with the collaboration of Montigny, and which was adopted by the French Army in 1865. The invention of Fafschamps thus became the basis of the \\"mitrailleuse\\", which was used by the French in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870. Initially kept under wraps as a secret weapon, it became widely used in battle by French artillery during the Franco-Prussian War (1870‚Äì71).

A \\"kiss with the tongue\\" stimulates the partner's lips, tongue and mouth, which are sensitive to the touch and induce physiological sexual arousal. The oral zone is one of the principal erogenous zones of the body. The implication is of a slow, passionate kiss which is considered intimate, romantic, erotic or sexual. The sensation when two tongues touch, also known as \\"tongue touching\\", has been proven to stimulate endorphin release and reduce acute stress levels. French kissing is often described as ‚Äò1st base‚Äô, and is used by many as an indicator of what stage a relationship has reached.  Etymology  A French kiss is so called because at the beginning of the 20th century, in the English-speaking world, the French had acquired a reputation for more adventurous and passionate sex practices. It originated in America and Great Britain. In France, it is referred to as un baiser amoureux (\\"a lover's kiss\\") or un baiser avec la langue (\\"a kiss with the tongue\\"), even if in past times it was also known as baiser Florentin (\\"Florentine kiss\\"). The Petit Robert 2014 French dictionary, released on May 30, 2013, added the French verb \\"se galocher\\" ‚Äî slang for kissing with tongues ‚Äî making it the first time a single word described the practice (except in Quebec, where the verb \\"frencher\\" means French kissing; Australia, where the term \\"pash\\" is used; the English verb ‚Äùshift‚Äù is used in casual conversation in Ireland; the German verb knutschen; the Italian verbs limonare and pomiciare; and the Hungarian verb megcs√≥kol/cs√≥kol√≥zik).  Disease risks  French kissing carries moderate risk of HPV. The possibility of contracting HIV from French kissing is extremely low as transmission would require an open wound. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention considers transmission of Hepatitis B via French kissing to be an unlikely mode of infection. Occasionally syphilis can be passed through prolonged French kissing, but this usually requires contact with an active lesion. French kissing is an unlikely mode of transmission of infection by gonorrhea.

It is southeast of Wommels and southeast of Itens, in the middle of Bolsward, Sneek, Leeuwarden and Franeker. The center is situated on the Oosterendervaart, which connects the Wijnsevaart and the Hidaardervaart with each other. In 2019 the village had 970 residents. The village also includes the hamlets Driehuizen (uninhabited part) Meilahuizen and Schrok. Until 1955 Roodhuis was also part of Oosterend. History The age of the village is unclear, it may have originated when the island on which it was situated, also referred to as Oosterend, had been diked. This was the earliest dike. It is also thought that it was created on a mound before that, but the village itself had several elevations, whether or not they were raised. Various surrounding villages lay within the island, such as Hennaard, Itens and Lutkewierum. The village became the most important village after the establishment of theGrietenij of Hennaarderadeel. Wommels later took over this position. In 1378 the place was mentioned as to Aestereynde, in 1402 as to Aesterende, in 1433 as in Oestereynde and in 1505 as Oestereynd. The place name indicates that it was located at the eastern (Oudfries: Aester) end (eynde) of something. In 1991 the official name was changed to Frisian-language Easterein. Until the municipal reorganization in 1984, Oosterend was part of the municipality of Hennaarderadeel. After this it was part of the municipality of Littenseradiel.

It was designed by architect Graham Gund and opened to the public on 25 January 2006. The facility cost approximately $70 million to build. Planning and construction Plans were begun in 2001 for an athletic center to replace the then-outdated Ernst Center and Wertheimer Fieldhouse that had previously served Kenyon College. The building was originally intended to be called the Fitness, Recreation, and Athletic facility (FRA). Designs were made in collaboration with coaches and other athletics personnel, such as swimming coach Jim Steen, who was consulted while making designs for the \\"state-of-the- art\\" natatorium. The KAC was built on the south end of Kenyon's campus, over the site of the former Wertheimer Fieldhouse, which was demolished to make way for the new facility. Construction began in 2003 and the facility was first opened to the public on 25 January 2006, two semesters after the originally projected date of completion (May 2005) and almost three years after the beginning of construction. Architecture and features The athletic center consists of a hangar-like structure approximately long and wide, or in total, with an arching roof supported by concrete columns in the center of the building and along the perimeter. A frequently noted feature of the building is the use of glass to create an \\"open\\" feel and provide natural lighting-- most of the outer wall is made of baffled glass panels. There is also integratedness between the different areas of the facility: most interior walls do not reach the ceiling, making it possible to see and hear activities in other parts of the building. A key feature of the building is its natatorium, which serves as the principal training for the \\"Lords\\" and \\"Ladies\\" Kenyon swimming teams; the Lords have won 31 consecutive NCAA Division III championships, making them the team with the most NCAA titles in any sport, and the Ladies have won 23 (nonconsecutive) titles. The natatorium includes an olympic-size swimming pool with a \\"state-of-the-art regenerative media filter\\" (which, it has been claimed, saves 600,000 gallons of water a year), and is climate-controlled and hermetically sealed off from the rest of the facility. The glass walls of the facility also play an important role in heating and regulating the temperature of the building: the glass panels have reflective coatings that control the entry of heat into the building, and are made up of two panes separated by a pocket of air which, along with the air between the glass panels and the interior sound baffling, are meant to help insulate the building and preserve energy. According to Calvin Frost, chairman of the Channeled Resources Group, Kenyon students placed a high value on ecological friendliness when sharing their attitudes about the KAC. In addition to its natatorium, the KAC includes a 200-meter indoor track, tennis courts, and a basketball arena. As one of the primary goals of the building's design was to cater to recreational users and the student community in addition to varsity athletes, it also includes a weight and fitness room, a multi-purpose athletic court for intramural sports and community use, squash courts, dance studios, conference rooms, a movie theater, and a small caf√©. Recognition The facility has been widely praised for its architectural design, and has won several awards. It won the 2007 Facilities of Merit award from Athletic Business magazine, the New England AIA Merit Award for Design Excellence, and the Boston Society of Architects Honor Award, and was nominated for the 2007 Court of the Year award from the American Sports Builders Association. On the other hand, it has also received some criticism for its high cost. Use in 2007 Will Graham celebration From 5 to 7 October 2007, the KAC was rented out to Will Graham of the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association for the 2007 Will Graham Celebration, which was attended by approximately 5,000 people. The event was met with some controversy among the mostly liberal‚Äìprogressive Kenyon College community, as Graham's son Franklin Graham had been accused of making discriminatory anti-Islamic statements; numerous students and faculty called the choice to host the event \\"inappropriate\\" and criticized Kenyon's administration for having allowed it. Several weeks before the Celebration, about 300 residents of Knox County, Ohio, in which Kenyon is located, gathered near the Kenyon Athletic Center for a \\"Surround the KAC\\" event to \\"form a shield of protection\\" around the property in preparation for the Celebration. The event was also intended as an outreach to the non-Christian community. In order to avoid trespassing on college property, the group used the public roads around the athletic facility to surround and \\"bath[e] the building in prayer\\".

Kaltinƒónai has around 728 inhabitants (2011). The town is in a hollow, and it is rumoured that a large lake existed at the end of the Ice age where it now sits. Kaltinƒónai is surrounded by famous mounds such as Skuburkalnis, ≈†vedkalnis, Kepalu≈°kalnis and Medvƒógalis. There are also two rivers nearby, the Akmena and the I≈ænƒó. Notable buildings include the church, an old wooden synagogue,Center for Jewish Art (2004). \\"Preserved Wooden Synagogues in Lithuania\\". The Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Retrieved on December 17, 2008. a home for the elderly and the Rehabilitation Centre.  History  A stone axe discovered in the town suggests that the area was already inhabited by the Neolithic period. Historians believe that the town was originally part of a larger settlement, but later it split and Kaltinƒónai became a separate region. Kaltinƒónai was first mentioned in a German chronicle as terram Kalctene in 1371. Northern Crusaders tried to conquer Kaltinƒónai castle many times (in 1375, 1377 and 1389, also planned from 1386-1394), but local inhabitants repelled the attacks. At the end of the 14th century and beginning of the 15th Kaltinƒónai was one of 6‚Äì7 of the most important centres in ≈Ωemaitija. Signatures of noblemen from Kaltinƒónai can be found on important documents. The town was so important that Vytautas the Great ordered one of the first Catholic churches in ≈Ωemaitija built in Kaltinƒónai (the local population didn't convert to Christianity until 1413) and it was complete by 1421. The See of ≈Ωemaitija was founded in 1417 and it ruled the town for more than 400 years. Kaltinƒónai the town was established in 1524. It first appeared on a Polish map two years later, earlier than most of the surrounding towns. There were more than 70 farms in Kaltinƒónai as of 1638, but by 1668 only 50 remained. After the Great Northern War the town continued to decline, for example in 1773 there were only 15 farms that could pay a tax, 19 in 1778. In 1842 authorities of the Russian tsar brought the ecclesiastical lands under their control and in 1861 made Kaltinƒónai the volost centre. In 1901 a local teacher O. Skobinas published the book Kaltinƒónai town in which he described contemporary town life. He wrote that a post office opened in 1861, a paramedic centre in 1882, a savings bank in 1897, and a chemist in 1898. Small markets took place every Wednesday, and large ones six times a year. 10 shops, several tearoom-canteens, and 17 craftsmen (seven tailors, five shoemakers, two blacksmiths, two glaziers and a woodworker) also worked in the town. 430 people lived in Kaltinƒónai at that time--263 Catholics, 140 Jews, 15 Orthodox and 12 Evangelical Lutherans. Skobinas also mentions that many people had left the area for America to look for a better life. Kaltinƒónai inhabitants were very active in the 1905 Russian Revolution and the town also remained volost centre after the declaration of the Lithuania Independence Act in 1918. The town grew from 660 inhabitants in 1923 to 800 in 1939. Various shops were open in the town during that period, and there was a very active cultural life. The German Occupation reached Kaltinƒónai in June 1941. German soldiers and Lithuanians transferred all Jewish men aged 15 and older, along with those from nearby towns, to the Heydekrug (Silute) work camp. All the Jewish men of Kaltinƒónai were killed before troops arrived to liberate the region--one group of weak and elderly men in August 1941, another group in October and November, about 100 men in 1943 when they were transferred from Heydekrug to Auschwitz, some in a Warsaw typhus epidemic after Auschwitz, and the rest in Dachau in 1944. The Jewish women and children were made to do agricultural work, then in September 1941 they were shot en masse in T≈´binƒós forest about seven kilometres () from Kaltinƒónai and buried in mass graves that eventually held 1200 people. A Lithuanian Underground Representatives‚Äô Congress gathered in Kaltinƒónai on 5 September 1944. Its goal was to unite all patriotic organisations into one central resistance group. Although seven representatives were caught in an accident caused by Soviet reconnaissance, and German occupation authorities also sent their representative to the Congress, the Congress was nonetheless very important because the Lithuanian Army for Freedom came out of it as the main organiser of resistance. On 7 October 1944 Kaltinƒónai was occupied by the soviet army and the second Soviet Occupation began. Although this was one of the most difficult times in Lithuanian history, Kaltinƒónai retained considerable significance as the centre of the precinct, kolkhoz and parish. The population declined sharply after World War II, but it began to climb again some years later. Since Lithuania gained independence in 1990, Kaltinƒónai has continued to honour its traditions. The town remains the centre of the eldership, which contains 74 settlements.  Kaltinƒónai Aleksandras Stulginskis Gymnasium  Kaltinƒónai Aleksandras Stulginskis Gymnasium A parish school was founded in Kaltinƒónai in 1777. This was later divided into four departments of primary school. In 1944 a pro-gymnasium was founded and after five years it was reorganised into a school with seven forms. In 1951 this school became the secondary school, and in 1969 a new school building was constructed. Since 1992 the school has participated in a foreign exchange program with the German Hankensb√ºttel Gymnasium. On 20 December 1999 the school was named Aleksandras Stulginskis Secondary School, and on 29 January 2009 the school became a gymnasium. The school now has both primary and secondary divisions, as well as some divisions in nearby villages. The primary school is housed in the former hostel, with four years of study and a kindergarten. The secondary school is housed in a two-story building with six forms, two optional higher forms, administrative offices, a canteen, a library, two gyms and an Aleksandras Stulginskis museum. There are over 500 students and over 50 teachers. In 2006 the school won a grant to improve its energy use and was renovated.  The Church  St. John the Baptist church Since Vytautas the Great built the first wooden church in 1416, there have been about six wooden churches in Kaltinƒónai. Some of these churches burned down and others simply collapsed. The second-most recent church was built in 1896 and burned down in 1988. Only a traditional masonry stone fence, its gate and a wooden belfry remain. After the belfry was rearranged into a temporary chapel it lost the original form somewhat. The current church, known as the church of St. John the Baptist, was designed by an architect Regimantas Andriu≈°keviƒçius and completed in 1995. It is a modern sacred architecture building with two high triangular towers and a high white marble and bronze sculpture of The Risen Christ by A. Vaura. V. ≈†vanys created stained glass windows for the basement chambers of the church.  The Graveyard  The chapel The parish graveyard is on the west side of the town. There is an octagonal wooden folk architecture chapel on the hill, built in 1798 and restored in 1989. There are also many saints‚Äô sculptures on the same hill. The chapel is surrounded by many very old, historical and artistic graves around the chapel, marked with metallic crosses and other gravestones. A high stone obelisk for Dionizas Po≈°ka stands near the chapel. Po≈°ka was a great poet and founder of the Baubliai museum, the first history museum in Lithuania. Marijona Stulginskienƒó (Aleksandras Stulginskis's mother) is buried on the southeast side of the graveyard hill.  The Pilƒós mound (Kepalu≈°kalnis)  The Pilƒós mound The Pilƒós mound (or Kepalu≈°kalnis) is one of the most valuable cultural monuments in the ≈†ilalƒó region. Its hillsides stand at high, and the upper part of the mound is about . Its sides were originally surrounded by defence ramparts that are now flat, but the location of two ramparts is still visible, as are three defence ditches. Based on the size of the mound and the dimensions of its fortifications, one of the strongest castles in ≈Ωemaitija stood on the Pilƒós Mound during the war with the Crusaders. There have also been various archaeological finds on the mound, such as stone shells.  The Rehabilitation Centre  The Rehabilitation Centre of Kaltinƒónai stands near the church. It was built by local priest Petras Linkeviƒçius. The Centre offers a swimming pool, salt and herb baths, underwater massage and a comfortable training-hall.

Signed to Polygram (Australia) in 1996, producing the eponymously titled ARIA nominated album 'EQUA' in the same year. The Sydney Dance Company has two works in their permanent repertoire, 'Unwitting Sight' (1998) and 'Cradle Song' (2001) choreographed by Wakako Asano to music by Equa. In 1996, Sadia also worked on the TUC 'Respect:Unite Against Racism' campaign, producing the single 'Respect' featuring dozens of international recording artists. The project received a commendation from the House of Commons (UK) through the passage of an Early Day Motion (EDM). Her work has been widely sequenced to films and television programmes by companies such as Polygram/Miramax, Interscope, and Universal Pictures, among others. =Film and installations= Sadia produced, edited, and (working with Stephen W. Tayler as Equa) scored the short film The Noon Gun. Based on footage originally shot in Afghanistan in 1971, and with the support of the British Council, The Noon Gun was shortlisted for the Satyajit Ray Foundation short film competition and has been featured in film festivals worldwide. As a filmmaker, Sadia has also produced and edited the short 'The End of the Party: Hyde Park 1969', a view of the 60's based on previously unseen footage of the famous first performance by Blind Faith in Hyde Park; produced and edited 'Iggy the Eskimo Girl', a short featuring Syd Barrett's (Pink Floyd) girlfriend Iggy, ubiquitously and affectionately known in the 1960s as 'Iggy the Eskimo girl'; and directed, produced and edited the film 'Lit From Within: The Film and Glass Works of Anthony Stern', a short documentary by Sadia about the filmmaker and glass artist Anthony Stern, which explores some of Anthony's life and works, and examines the aesthetic and philosophical relationship between glass and film as materials through which light passes. She also worked as director, editor, producer and sound designer on 'San Francisco Redux No. 1', the first installment of a multi-channel installation work. The latter films had their world premiere as part of the curated programme 'Le Cinema D'Avant-Garde' at Cin√©math√®que Fran√ßaise in Paris, France, on June 27, 2008. Sadia is also the creator of the single channel video installation 'The Memory of Water (Part 1)' which was acquired by Australian Centre for the Moving Image(ACMI) to form part of its permanent collection of exemplary works by Australian and international artists. It featured in the exhibition 'Proof: The Act of Seeing With One's Own Eyes'. In 2009, Sadia was awarded a Studio 18 artists' residency, for international \\"contemporary visual artists pursuing an innovative practice in a professional capacity\\", at Gertrude Contemporary in Melbourne, Australia. This also marked the first public view of her 2009 installation work 'Noise/Ghosts of Noise'. During this time she commenced work on her filmed multi-channel installation, 'Metamorphoses in 'A' Minor, filmed at the Kennedy Miller Mitchell motion capture soundstage at Sydney Gate in Sydney, Australia, with the support of Gertrude Contemporary and a British Council (Aus) Project Grant. The work takes place over three ‚Äòmovements‚Äô or ‚Äòchapters‚Äô, 'Formation', 'Emergence' and 'Flight' and features the Australian dancer and choreographer Wakako Asano. It is set to an original neo-classical composition produced in collaboration with the UK composer and sound artist Stephen W. Tayler (Suzanne Vega, Peter Gabriel, √âric Serra, Bob Geldof, Kate Bush), using recorded layers and repetitive themes that build sequentially until an eventual moment of release. It is a work in the tradition of symbolic mysticism, an exploration of the transformative nature of the individual. Since January 2013 Sadia has been based out of Real World Studios. In January 2014, Sadia completed ‚ÄòAll Time and Space Fold into the Infinite Present (Cataract Gorge)‚Äô a large-scale three channel filmed installation with an accompanying eight channel soundfield. The work features footage of the rapids captured by the artist in Cataract Gorge, Launceston, Tasmania. The footage has been slowed down and colour balanced to resemble deep space, while the motion remains that of the water. This produces a meditative work that draws together the artist‚Äôs ideas about time, space, and the land. The accompanying eight (8) channel soundfield is constructed of audio captured by the artist in the Gorge. The work premiered at the Queen Victoria Museum and Art Gallery (QVMAG) Inveresk, Launceston, Tasmania, Australia‚Äôs largest regional museum, on January 10, 2014 and ran through March 2, 2014. It has since been acquired by the museum for their permanent collection.

In 1925 the Deutsche Reichsbahn incorporated arranged these locomotives as DRG Class 99.61.  History  For the hilly line of the M√ºglitztalbahn from M√ºgeln to Geising-Altenberg the S√§chsische Maschinenfabrik in Chemnitz developed an eight-coupled locomotive which, it was envisaged, would handle this route better that the hitherto deployed Saxon Classes I K and IV K. In 1901 and from 1905 to 1907 a total of nine locomotives were placed in service. Those built in 1905 had a slightly larger driver's cab. Whilst the new type of drive using Klien-Lindner axles allowed the eight- coupled engines to negotiate tight curves, in the end the new Class V K proved just as complicated and maintenance-intensive as the tried and tested IV K. For that reason no more were procured, despite their better starting characteristics. All nine engines, numbered 201 to 209 were taken over in 1920 by the Deutsche Reichsbahn and in 1925 were renumbered to 99 611 to 99 619. Between 1934 and 1942 the locomotives were all retired. It is possible that several locomotives were left on the battlefields of the Second World War following duties at the front.  Technical features  The boiler had the same dimensions as the Saxon IV K. The boiler feed was provided by two Friedmann injectors. The steam engine itself was a two-cylinder compound which drove the second coupled axle. The low-pressure cylinder on the right was set at an angle due to its large size. The first and fourth coupled axles were Klien-Lindner hollow axles which enabled an outside frame with Hall cranks. Two pull rods arranged in a cross enabled the transverse movement of the two hollow axles to be set by the same amount. For braking, the locomotives were originally equipped with a steam brake and counterweight brake. In addition the locomotives were fitted for Heberlein brakes. But by 1920 they were given the new K√∂rting vacuum brakes for engine and train. The water supplies were carried in side tanks; the coal was stored in a bunker behind the cab.  Duties  The six locomotives went into service on the M√ºglitztalbahn. Even after the appearance of the more powerful VI K they remained on this route. After the conversion of the M√ºglitztalbahn to standard gauge in the 1930s the locomotives were transferred to other lines. They were used on the M√ºgeln and Thum railway networks and the Taubenheim‚ÄìD√ºrrhennersdorf narrow gauge railway.

He was hired in by Branch Rickey, then the General Manager of the St. Louis Cardinals, to write features about the Cardinals for small-town newspapers that could not afford to cover the team in person. To do this, Karst set up MLB's first press office. In this post, he wrote stories, created promotions, and made players available for interviews and guest appearances. He spent four years in this position with the Cardinals before moving on to join the Cincinnati Reds in the same capacity. While with the Reds, Karst played a major role in baseball history by creating as a promotion MLB's first night game. The game was played on May 24, , with the Cincinnati Reds defeating the Philadelphia Phillies 2-1 at Cincinnati's Crosley Field. In 2001, Karst was inducted into the St. Louis Media Hall of Fame. He died on April 6, 2004, at age 97 in Ladue, Missouri. References * Obituary, Sports Collectors Digest, Krause Publications, May 21, 2004.

The program takes place in mid-May, and includes a two-day trip to Germany, followed by a five-day visit to Poland. The international MRH program was founded in 2001 by Dr. David Machlis of the United States and Eli Rubenstein of Canada, both of whom were involved in the March of the Living program. During the trip students visit locations in Germany and Poland related to the Holocaust and other World War II genocides, including the site of the Wannsee Conference, and the former concentration/death camps of Auschwitz, Treblinka and Majdanek. The purpose of the March of Remembrance and Hope is to teach students of various religious and ethnic backgrounds about the dangers of intolerance through the study of the Holocaust and other World War II genocides, and to promote better relations among people of diverse cultures. Holocaust survivors also participate in the March of Remembrance and Hope program, sharing their painful memories in the very places in which their stories transpired. During the trip, the students also meet one of the Righteous Among the Nations, and learn of the heroic actions a minority of Europe's population took to resist Nazi tyranny. Since its inception, students of many diverse religions, backgrounds and ethnicities have taken part in the March of Remembrance and Hope program, including: Buddhist, Christian, Hindu, Jewish, Muslim, Seventh Day Adventist, and many others. In addition, students who come from their own history of persecution (such as survivors of the Rwandan genocide, First Nation students, African Americans, etc.) have also participated in the March of Remembrance and Hope. From 2007 to 2011 the program was run annually in Canada for Canadian university students, by the Canadian Centre for Diversity, with the cooperation of other organizations. In 2013, CCD transferred the program over to March of the Living Canada. The major funder of the Canadian program is the Azrieli Foundation, founded by Canadian Holocaust survivor, David Azrieli, which is a Canadian philanthropic organization that supports a wide range of initiatives and programs, among which include Holocaust commemoration and education. The international MRH program is currently on hold, but there are American groups who have traveled with the Canadian delegation, namely Nazareth College and Hobart and William Smith Colleges. There is also an Austrian program by the same name for university students of diverse backgrounds that travels to Poland earlier during the year, during the March of the Living (MOL). In 2010, Nazareth College and Hobart and William Smith Colleges launched their own program called The March: Bearing Witness to Hope - https://web.archive.org/web/20110421035711/http://morah.naz.edu/. (While there are similarities, MRH and MOL are two different programs. MRH is primarily aimed at university students of diverse backgrounds, does not include a trip to Israel, and its goals are of a universal nature. MOL is primarily aimed at Jewish high school students, and in addition to universal goals, also includes goals related to Jewish identity and connection to Israel, and usually includes a week long trip to Israel following the Poland portion of the trip.) Two student organizations in Canada dedicated to teaching tolerance and combating genocide, \\"‚ÄôShout Canada \\"‚Äô and \\"‚ÄôStand Canada \\"‚Äô, were founded by students who participated in Marches to Poland. Many of the student leaders and active members of these two organizations are alumni of the March of Remembrance and Hope program. On January 27, 2007, International Holocaust Remembrance Day, Ms. Marie Mirlande Noel, an African American student at the College of St. Elizabeth, and a graduate of the MRH program, addressed the United Nations about her experience on the March of Remembrance and Hope program. Goals of the March of Remembrance and Hope Program # To never again allow for the unchecked rise of the menace of anti-Semitism or any kind of racial discrimination directed by any individual or group in society against another to gain strength. Included in this goal is the teaching that all human beings are equal, precious and valued, and the diminution of the dignity of any member of the human family is a cardinal violation of all ethical teachings. # To recognize and learn from the altruistic actions of the \\"righteous among the nations\\", who teach us to never be a bystander in the face of oppression. # To remember those who perished, to be a witness, thus denying Hitler a \\"posthumous victory\\". The role of the survivor is a key element in this goal. # To pay tribute to the courage of those who survived the Holocaust, who rebuilt their lives despite the haunting memories of the past. # To honor the heroic veterans of World War II who fought to liberate Europe from the hands of Nazi tyranny. # To welcome opportunities to learn about participants' different ethnicities and beliefs so that we may transcend our religious, political, and cultural boundaries in order to bear witness to the common humanity we all share. # To inspire participants to commit to building a world free of oppression and intolerance, a world of freedom, democracy and justice, for all members of the human family. Related to this goal is to teach the message that, when participants return to their communities, each of them has the ability to make a real and lasting difference in the world. # The final goal is not so much to learn from or about history, but to enter into history. By visiting Germany and Poland, students are taking part in a commemorative act that declares that the memory of six million Jews and millions of other innocent victims - Poles, Roma and Sinti, Jehovah's Witnesses, homosexuals, the disabled and political prisoners - who were murdered during the Holocaust and World War II, has been marked and will never be forgotten.

His Theory of Universal Magnetism provides an alternative for the Big Bang theory, and includes the concepts of the evolution of atoms and God particles. He provided 14 principles for World Peace. He presented a blueprint at United Nations for World Peace. He founded over 300 yoga centres around the world and wrote about 80 books, many of which became academic textbooks. Tamil Nadu government has recently approved to teach his Simplified Kundalini Yoga at Schools. He was declared the 19th Siddha by the Dravidian University. Early life Shri Vethathiri Maharishi was born on 14 August 1911 in the village of Guduvancheri, south of Chennai, India, into an indigent weaver's family. After spending several years in various minor employment, he established a textile concern that grew to employ over 2,000 workers on a profit-sharing basis. Maharishi regularly participated in intense meditation and introspection, which he claims brought him full enlightenment at the age of thirty-five. At the age of fifty, he closed his commercial ventures and devoted himself solely to spiritual service. However, he remained a \\"householder\\", i.e. he did not break his family ties or take vows of renunciation, but rather lived in the indigenous Siddha tradition, maintaining family ties. Poems and books Shri Vethathiri Maharishi wrote over 3000 poems on philosophical subjects. In the Indian philosophical tradition, his philosophy corresponds to pure Advaita. His language and attitudes are contemporary, non-sectarian and non-dogmatic. He authored about 80 books in Tamil and English, and continued to write until his death. Spiritual teachings Vethathiri strove to find answers to three questions: \\"What is God?\\" \\"What is life?\\" \\"Why is poverty in the world?\\" The search to find these answers as well as to further his lot in life led him into various fields of endeavour, including becoming a qualified practitioner of two systems of Indian indigenous medicine, Ayurveda and Siddha, and certified practitioner Homeopathy as well. Vethathiri led the life of a householder until he was 50, and then changed the course of his life from being a businessman to teach and write about his experiences of purported divine revelations. He published many books in English and Tamil. Between 1972‚Äì1993, he visited the US, Europe, Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea, Japan, and Mexico. Vethathiri's science of living (Vethathiriyam) Vethathiri Maharishi claimed to synthesize a complete science of living for the betterment of humanity through: Simplified Kundalini Yoga meditation, Physical Exercises, Kaya Kalpa Yoga and Introspections. Vethathiri's lifetime works are called Vethathiriyam, which literally translates as a roadmap to the mountain of knowledge. He claimed that a deep understanding of nature is essential for living in harmony with the law of nature, while balancing material well-being with spiritual progress. Vethathiri that the primordial state of the universe, which he called Absolute Space, has two inherent attributes that are latent: *Force or Gravity: Inexhaustible self-compressive force, the source of all forces, which acts everywhere *Consciousness: The omniscient order of function in everything. According to Swamiji, as a result of the self-compressive nature of the absolute space, an infinitesimal volume of space begins to spin in a whirling motion, called a fundamental energy particle. He believed that the spinning action propels an outward repulsive force, and that the co- joining of the two forces, attractive and repulsive, is defined as Universal Magnetism. Vethathiri maintained that this fills the universe as a wave, and that it is the first phase of self-transformation of the absolute space from being to becoming. Organizations In 1958 Shri Vethathiri Maharishi founded the World Community Service Centre (WCSC), a non-profit registered society with a view to working towards World Peace through individual peace. As of today, more than 200 trusts and about 2000 meditation centres have been registered and affiliated to WCSC in India. From 1972 to 1993, he travelled abroad annually, lecturing and teaching extensively in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, and the USA. In 1984 he founded the \\"Vethathiri Maharishi Yoga and Kaya Kalpa Research Foundation\\" based in Aliyar, Pollachi, Tamil Nadu in the name of Arutperunjothi Nagar. This is located on Pollachi-Valparai Highway SH-78, next to Azhiyar Dam and State Transportation buses are available to Arutperunjothi Nagar from Pollachi. Facilities are provided for large groups to stay and undergo SKY courses of several days in duration. The Temple of Consciousness is the centerpiece of the campus. In 1998 the Brain Trust was established to bring together intellectuals of various fields to discuss the issues facing mankind and work towards solutions for bringing about peace and harmony to the individual and to the world at large. Vethathiri Maharishi died on 28 March 2006 in Coimbatore. His embalmed body is now located in Mani Mandapam inside the World Community Service Center, Arutperunjothi Nagar, Azhiyar, Pollachi.  Stamp on Vethathiri Maharishi released  Receiving from former Union Minister for Communications and Information Technology A. Raja the first copy of a commemorative postage stamp on Vethathiri Maharishi, the then Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi said that the centenary celebrations and postage stamps on eminent persons and freedom fighters would help the youth to be inspired and emulate such personalities. Talking about Vethathiri Maharishi, the former Chief Minister said: \\"The teachings of Vethathiri Maharishi (1911‚Äì2006) have been receiving acclaim because the spiritual leader possessed the \\"weapon\\" of rationalism. To attract people, the spiritual leader did not use magical powers or claim that he was in contact with god. As he had possessed rationalism that would help people to realise themselves, his teachings and messages were still adored. Ramalinga Swamigal (1823‚Äì1874) and Vethathiri Maharishi were conscious of the influence of superstitions on people and they strove for showing the correct path, Mr. Karunanidhi said. N. Mahalingam, industrialist and president of the Temple of Consciousness, Aliyar, recalled his relationship with Maharishi and said the World Community Service Centre founded by the spiritual leader was an outcome of the Satya Gnana Sabai of Adigal.Stamp on Vethathiri Maharishi released. The Hindu. 14 August 2010.  Vethathiri Maharishi's 14 point World Peace Plan  Vethathiri Maharishi was affected by the events and happenings of the Second World War. Even as young man he wanted to change the functioning of the society. He wanted peace to prevail in the World. World Peace through Individual Peace has always been the core of his teachings. He has given a 14 point World Peace plan and has authored a book - Vethathirian Principles of Life. The 14 point principles as stated by Vethathiri Maharishi to achieve World Peace are : 1\\\\. World Without War 2\\\\. Economic Justice 3\\\\. A Fair Judiciary 4\\\\. One World Federal Government 5\\\\. Reformation of Culture 6\\\\. Living under the guidance of intellectuals 7\\\\.

She was also the first to recognise the association between familial periodic paralysis and low blood potassium levels.  Early life and education  Mary Walker was born at Croft-an-Righ, Wigtown, Scotland in 1888. The eldest of four children, her father was a solicitor. After school, she trained in medicine at the Edinburgh College of Medicine for Women, and like most of the College's students, she received much of her clinical teaching in Glasgow. She graduated MB ChB from the University of Edinburgh in 1913. Career and research During the First World War, she served with the Royal Army Medical Corps at the 63rd General Hospital, Malta. In 1920 she became a salaried Assistant Medical Officer in \\"Poor Law Service\\" at St Alfege's Hospital, Greenwich, London, where she worked until 1936. In 1932, she was awarded Membership of the Royal College of Physicians. She then worked at St Leonard's Hospital, Shoreditch, St. Francis' Hospital, Dulwich and St Benedict's Hospital, Tooting. In 1934, while working at St Alfege's Hospital, Walker discovered that the subcutaneous injection of physostigmine could temporarily reverse the muscle weakness found in patients suffering from myasthenia gravis. She had noted that the symptoms and signs of myasthenia were similar to those found in curare poisoning, and physostigmine was used as an antidote to curare poisoning at that time. The first case of myasthenia gravis successfully treated with physostigmine was published in the Lancet in June 1934. In 1935, Walker was the first to recognise the association between the condition familial periodic paralysis and hypokalaemia (low blood potassium levels). She also described the glucose challenge test used in diagnosing hypokalaemic periodic paralysis and the use of intravenous potassium in its treatment. During 1935, her research on myasthenia was incorporated into her MD thesis which was submitted via the University of Edinburgh, and for which she received a Gold Medal. After her retirement to Croft-an-Righ in 1954, she continued to work part-time at the Glasgow Royal Maternity and Women's Hospital, and remained active in the field of myasthenia gravis. Her 1973 article also describes the Mary Walker Effect, a clinical sign found in myasthenia gravis. She died on 13 September 1974 at the age of 86. Awards and honours In 1962, Walker was the first recipient of the Royal College of Physicians Jean Hunter Prize \\"for the advancement of research into the treatment of nervous exhaustion and for her original contribution to the fundamental knowledge of the nature of myasthenia gravis, made while carrying out the routine duties of a medical officer at a large metropolitan hospital\\".

Over the course of several decades, the movement has issued various publications in support of the scientific concepts behind the process of evolution and frequently engages in promoting how religious scripture supports the concept. Adam and Eve Ahmadi Muslims reject the creationist doctrine that Adam was the first human being on Earth, and proclaim that he was appointed as the first Prophet of God. They point to a verse in the Quran which refers to the appointment of a representative of God on earth, rather than the creation of a new species: Ahmadis reason that the angels could only have questioned the appointment of a human being as a prophet because they had already witnessed disorder and bloodshed amongst the already-existing humans. The story of Adam and Eve as given in the Bible is viewed by Ahmadis as being more of an account of religious history than a history of the entire human race. Belal Khalid, an Ahmadi scholar, states in his work, ‚ÄúOriginal Sin‚Äù: Guided evolution Ahmadi Muslims do not take all the Quranic and Biblical creation narratives literally, but understand some of the passages metaphorically.Guided evolution and punctuated equilibrium Darwinian evolution as well as intelligent design models are rejected as are certain aspects of Islamic creationism that some modernist religious bodies have postulated. Instead they propound the concept of \\"guided evolution\\" (analogous, or identical, to the doctrine of theistic evolution or evolutionary creationism). Mirza Tahir Ahmad favored the perspective that the human race was created gradually via evolution under the supervision of God. He interpreted the Quran's description of different human \\"stages\\", traditionally believed to refer to fetal development, as references to evolutionary stages: Ahmad believed that these verses support the notion that the creation of the human race was the culmination of a gradual evolutionary process, as opposed to a literalist reading of the creation story, in which mankind was created in an instant.Quran, Adam and Original Sin, by Belal Khalid Thus Ahmadis accept the concept of evolution in principle, but do not accept Darwinian evolution in all its details. They deny that natural selection occurred purely by chance,Revelation, Rationality, Knowledge & Truth: Part V, Section 5: Survival by Accident or Design? or merely by survival of the fittestRevelation, Rationality, Knowledge & Truth: Part V, Section 8: Natural Selection and Survival of the Fittest ‚Äì and view each stage of the evolutionary process as being selectively and continually woven to an intricate level by one creator (Allah).Revelation, Rationality, Knowledge & Truth: Part V, Section 12: Organic Systems and Evolution Ahmadis contend that the processes of life on Earth started from one single point of species (bacteria)Review of Religions eGazette November 2008 with a mixture of water and a viscous clay-like substance.Revelation, Rationality, Knowledge & Truth: Part V, Section 4: The Essential Role of Clay and Photosynthesis in Evolution The creation of Adam was a slow gradual evolutionary process that occurred over several stages, with each stage being of a variable timescale - perhaps over billions of years.Revelation, Rationality, Knowledge & Truth: Part V, Section 1: Life in the Perspective of Quranic Revelations ‚Äì A Brief Introductory Chapter In his book Revelation, Rationality, Knowledge and Truth (published 1998), Mirza Tahir Ahmad, the late leader of the Ahmadiyya movement, elaborated the complex mechanism of evolution as having been played more like strategic game of chess than a game of dice.Revelation, Rationality, Knowledge & Truth: Part V, Section 10: A Game of Chess or a Game of Chance! Subsequently evolutionary processes could only have been guided by a vastly higher intelligence, like God. Creation of the universe Similar to theistic realism and the stance of modernist Islamic scholars, Ahmadis adopt a scientific cosmological approach to explaining the formation of universe initiated from the Big Bang.Revelation, Rationality, Knowledge & Truth: Part IV, Section 5: The Quran and Cosmology They interpret some Quranic verses as references to the Big Bang theory, the formation of the Earth, and the Big Crunch theory. Six individual phases of creation Furthermore, Ahmadis highlight several verses in the Quran where it mentions of \\"Six periods of creation\\" and use these verses to explain the theory that the universe began roughly 13 billion years ago. A single period, in the Ahmadi view, has no definitive timescale and could mean anywhere from one day to billions of years. According to the Ahmadiyya view the universe passed from stage to stage till the Earth assumed a shape and developed properties which could sustain human life. Extraterrestrial evolution Generally, Ahmadis believe that life is almost certainly not limited to planet Earth. The possibility of life having evolved on other planets is clearly established in the first chapter of the Qur'an which speaks of the plurality of worlds: The following verse corroborates this interpretation: Ahmadis believe that any planet that contains the key ingredient of life‚Äîwater‚Äîmay also harbour life, as God has created all living things from water: References External links *Official website of Worldwide Ahmadiyya Muslim Community *Revelation, Rationality, Knowledge & Truth, by Mirza Tahir Ahmad *Original Sin, by Belal Khalid Category:Islam and science Category:Ahmadiyya beliefs and doctrines Category:Point of view ","title":"Ahmadiyya views on evolution"},{"id":"20123894","text":"Tujh Sang Preet Lagai Sajna is an Indian soap opera broadcast on STAR Plus channel. Produced by Balaji Telefilms, the series premiered on 3 November 2008 and ended on 5 February 2010. Story Balwant and Vikramaditya used to be best friends despite the fact that the latter was a land owner and the former was a farmer. Their friendship was an example for everyone and they were inseparable until one horrible day. Balwant's daughter Simran was supposed to marry Vikramaditya's son Sumer. But it turned out that Sumer was already married (and had a son with his wife Bindya). Sumer hadn't told anyone. On the day of his proposed marriage to Simran, Sumer runs away to get Bindiya and tells Vikramaditya everything. Simran follows Sumer to tell him that she respects his decision and she does not want to marry him if he is already married. Simran is heartbroken as she has loved Sumer since her childhood but she swallows her pain in order to make him happy. Balwant and Vikramaditya reach the train station, where Simran and Sumer are standing. A car runs over Simran. In a fit of rage Balwant's son Kuldeep shoots Sumer. Kuldeep goes to jail and the families become sworn enemies. Kaliganj (the village where they live) gets divided into two parts (Pratapgarh - Kishanganj) and separated by a border which no one can cross. One either belongs to Kishanganj (Vikramaditya's village) or Pratapgarh (Balwant's village). Sumer's son Yug (one year old at the time) is sent to London to study and stay away from the enmity in the village. Kuldeep's daughter Vrinda (born on the day of the shoot-out) is considered unlucky in the family by everyone except Balwant, as her father (Kuldeep) went to jail and her aunt (Simran) died the day she was born. =20 years later= This led to Yug and Vrinda‚Äîtwo people whose families are sworn enemies‚Äîto fall in love. After several unpleasant encounters, they fall deeply in love. Yug and Vrinda can't live without one another, and they plan to marry. That is when they find out about their families hating each other. They decide to get rid of the enmity by reminding Balwant and Vikramaditya how they used to be such great friends. When that does not work, Yug comes to live at Vrinda's house pretending to be the best friend of Vrinda's cousin Teji. Nobody in the family, except for Vrinda and Teji, knows who Yug really is. He wins everyone's hearts and the family decides to get Yug and Vrinda married. That's when Balwant finds out who Yug really is. Yug and Vrinda run away. But they do not marry each other and come back within a day. They tell their families that they could have married if they wanted, and no one would have been able to do anything. They didn't because they truly love each other and want their marriage to happen with everyone's blessings. Balwant and Vikramaditya are untouched and they drag Yug and Vrinda home. Before leaving Yug says to Balwant, \\"Vrinda meri amanat hai, jisse mein aapke paas chodke ja raha hoon. Par mein usse lene jaldi aonga.\\" (I am leaving Vrinda with you for a short while and I will come back to get her as she is only mine.) This makes Balwant and Vikramaditya furious. They meet and make a plan to get Vrinda married to someone else in another village. But they tell Vrinda that she will marry Yug. Meanwhile, Vikramaditya sends Yug out on a business trip to London. Vrinda marries Rajbeer, who does not know about this plan. Yug finds out what happened and does not know what to do. On the first night of marriage, Vrinda tells Rajbeer everything about her and Yug's love and their family's betrayal. She tells him that she thought she was marrying Yug and she cannot live with anyone else. Rajbeer (heartbroken) tells Vrinda that his grandmother is very ill and will only live about six months more. If Vrinda leaves Rajbeer, his grandmother will die right away. Vrinda agrees to stay in the house as Rajbeer's wife until his grandmother dies. Rajbeer promises that after six months, he will hand her over to Yug. During these 6 months Vrinda and Rajbeer fall in love. But they do not admit it to each other because Rajbeer thinks Vrinda still loves Yug. She thinks that Rajbeer thinks of her only as a friend. On the day that his grandmother dies, Rajbeer gives Vrinda to Yug. But Yug tells them both that they belong together, as he used to see Vrinda's eyes filled with love for him but that love is now for Rajbeer and he does not want to get in the way of their happiness. Vrinda thanks Yug and leaves with Rajbeer. Seeing that they tore their children apart, Balwant and Vikramaditya end their enmity and become best friends again. Yug still loves Vrinda deeply but marries Bharti byn his grandfather's wishes. Yug tells Bharti that they will only stay friends as he will always love Vrinda. Yug had told Bharti all this before marriage but she wanted to marry him anyway because she loved him a lot. At first it is shown that Bharti is a really sweet and beautiful girl who loves Yug deeply even though she knows about him and Vrinda. It is later revealed that Bharti is extremely jealous of Vrinda. Bharti is plotting to ruin Vrinda's life. Vrinda gets pregnant and Bharti convinces Rajbeer that the child belongs to Yug, by showing him some pictures that show Vrinda and Yug embracing. (The pictures were taken when Yug was consoling Vrinda). The baby dies at the age of only one month in a kidnapping attempt. Vrinda is devastated and Rajbeer is furious. He thinks Yug is the cause of everything. He thinks Yug and Vrinda are having an affair. Rajbeer declares enmity with Yug and says that if Vrinda keeps any relation with Yug, he will consider her dead. Vrinda, who loves Rajbeer a lot, agrees to not keep any relation with Yug. Two months later, Vrinda gets pregnant for a second time. As Vrinda returns from the clinic, she is nearly hit by a truck and is saved by Yug. Rajbeer comes at that moment and he sees Vrinda in Yug's arms. He thinks that Vrinda has still been meeting Yug and that this child, too, belongs to Yug and not him. He kicks Vrinda out of the house. Yug tries to explain things to Rajbeer but that does not work so he goes to Vrinda (who is at the train station) to apologise. But Vrinda screams at Yug saying that every time Yug comes into her life, something goes wrong and if he wants to see Vrinda happy he should never show his face to her again. Yug goes home, heartbroken, and he hears Bharti talking on the phone. He finds out how she was the one who showed Rajbeer the pics and ruined Vrinda's life and Yug gets furious. He confronts Bharti and screams at her saying there is so much difference between her and Vrinda, because Vrinda thinks about everyone else and Bharti only thinks about herself. Bharti screams at Yug saying that she did everything because she loved him. She wanted Yug to notice her but all he thought about was Vrinda. They divorce each other and Bharti goes away from everyone's life. The show takes an eight- year leap. =Eight years later= Rajbeer is now a huge business man like Yug used to be. Yug is nearly on the street because he refuses to do any business. Yug holds himself responsible for ruining Vrinda's life and wants to die as soon as possible. Rajbeer wants to ruin Yug financially and it seems to be working until Virnda comes back into their lives with her 8-year-old daughter, named Tulsi. Vrinda tells Yug that he had nothing to do with ruining her life, in fact he was the only one who stood by her. Relieved from his guilt, Yug goes back into business and gets back on top. Rajbeer finds Vrinda and makes a deal with her. If she supports him with a court case (Vrinda is the eye witness and her statement could make Rajbeer's nephew go to jail) he will let her live with him as his wife. Vrinda agrees. Initially Rajbeer hates Vrinda and tries to do everything that he could to make her life miserable but he starts to soften up slowly. Tulsi, with the help of her \\"Yug uncle\\" brings her parents close together. But Rajbeer finds out about this and he yells at Tulsi saying that Yug is her father not him. Tulsi is hurt but Yug explains to her that her dad is just angry and they have to pacify him. But Tulsi starts crying and asks why Rajbeer does not accept her as his daughter and why did he tell her that Yug was her dad. Vrinda hears this whole conversation, and she is heartbroken that Rajbeer hurt her daughter. She decides she can't live with someone who hates her daughter so much so she decides to leave Rajbeer's house and she moves into an inidan colony. At first Vrinda is happy living in the colony, but then some of the gossipy women of the colony start taunting Vrinda. They say that she has a daughter but no husband and that Tulsi is probably an illegitimate child, and that's why her dad does not come to see her. Vrinda is hurt by these comments and Tulsi is visibly disturbed by them. Vrinda decides that she will remarry so that no one will taunt Tulsi again. Vrinda asks Yug to marry her. Yug, still in love with Vrinda, says yes. Rajbeer finds out about the marriage and although he is insanely jealous he acts as if he does not care. After a series of drama and misunderstandings, on the day of Yug and Vrinda's wedding, Rajbeer finally finds out the truth about what Bharti did, and how Vrinda was never unfaithful to him. He goes to the temple where Yug and Vrinda are getting married and begs for Vrinda's forgiveness and asks her to come back to him. Vrinda has forgiven Rajbeer and wants to go back to him, but she does not say anything as she does not want to betray Yug (who accepted her and stood by her when no one else would). Rajbeer takes Vrinda's silence as her way of rejecting him and he is just about to leave when Yug stops him. Yug says that although Vrinda will not say anything to him, he loves her so much that he can even read her silence and he can always tell what she is thinking and what she wants. He puts Vrinda's hand in Rajbeer's, symbolizing that they will always be together. Rajbeer welcomes Vrinda back into his house (with a clear heart), and apologises to Yug. Yug and Rajbeer become best friends again and they join their companies and start doing business together. Yug becomes the huge business tycoon that he used to be again and life seems perfect. The sacred veil of the goddess in the temple flows over Yug and the girl as they stare in to each other's eyes. (This was exactly how Yug and Vrinda met for the first time.) Then they snap out of their eye lock and stand up straight. The girl introduces herself as Radha and Yug, mesmerised by her beauty (this is the first time Yug is mesmerised by anyone other than Vrinda) offers to drop her home. Radha accepts Yug's offer and gets into his car. While entering the car, Radha almost falls and Yug catches her. The show ends with Radha in Yug's arms, indicating that this is the start of a new love story. As the credits roll, Rajbeer and Vrinda are shown playing with two more kids. Yug and Radha are shown getting married and then cradling their newborn son in their arms. So everyone lives happily ever after. Cast and characters Production The series premiered on 3 November 2008 replacing Kahanii Ghar Ghar Kii at a prime slot 10:00 pm (IST). Within few days of its premiere, the shootings and telecast of all the Hindi television series including this series and films were stalled on 8 November 2008 due to dispute by the technician workers of FWICE (Federation of Western India Cine Employees) for increasing the wages, better work conditions and more breaks between shootings. FWICE first took a strike on 1 October 2008 when they addressed their problems with the producers and production was stalled. A contract was signed after four days discussions and shooting were happening only for two hours content in a day then after which differences increased between them while channels gave them time until 30 October 2008 to sort it out. Failing to do so lead to protests again from 10 November 2008 to 19 November 2008 during which channels blacked out new broadcasts and repeat telecasts were shown from 10 November 2008. On 19 November 2008, the strike was called off after settling the disputes and the production resumed. The new episodes started to telecast from 1 December 2008. Owing its average ratings since its inception, the series was given notice twice by the channel as of March 2009 and time until May 2009 IPL to improve its ratings. As it did not improve, it was moved to the afternoon slot in May 2009. Despite, it did not perform as expected and went off air on 5 February 2010.

The name Sarvodaya is taken from the Sanskrit meaning of 'awakening (udaya) of all (sarva)', and roots back to the Gandhian ideals. Fusion, as implied by the true meaning of the word, envisages the fusion of the vision and mission of Sarvodaya into the broader development scenario, using Information and Communication technologies (ICT) as a common fabric. Thus, Fusion is identified as the ICT for Development (ICT4D) movement of Sarvodaya.Sarodaya Fusion primarily, but not exclusively, works with the villages that have already been socially and economically uplifted through diverse community development programs carried out over a period of time. Thus they are better prepared to connect with the information age. For instance a community having a registered society, with a healthy track record of micro- finance activities is recognized as better prepared to interact with digital technologies. Fusion partners with multiple institutions including the State (Information and Communication Technology Agency of Sri Lanka), corporate, academic and civil organizations. Vision The project's vision is the e-Empowerment of rural poor communities. Fusion's broader mission is founded on the following three pillars; * Practice: keeping 'Community' first, and listening and recognizing the needs of the people, Fusion plans and implements programs as a response to their needs. * Partnership: Fusion trusts and values the interdependence, sharing and sense of cooperation of the donors, educational establishments, state and corporate institutions that are carrying out the programs. * Research: Fusion updates its development tools deriving information from the research. For instance, on one hand it seeks to adapt North-born technologies to the less well developed South. On the other hand, it strives to add value to indigenous wisdom and amplify the voices of the voiceless people of the South. History The program builds on the pioneering telecenter, that has been trialled by the Social Empowerment Program of Sarvodaya, in 1997, at a remote township (Kahawatta) of Ratnapura District, Sri Lanka. Since it started it has progressed through a remarkable learning curve; * Pilot testing and setting up of first ever Telecentre in Sri Lanka - 1997 * Formulation of Village Information Centre (VIC) concept and replication around the country - 1999 * First donor funded ICT program (by UNESCO Appeal) - 2003 * Initial partnership with Governments ICT program (eSriLanka) - 2003 * Developing Subsidy Voucher for the eSriLanka program - 2004 * Expansion of telecentre program with introduction of community scholarships (with Microsoft-UP) - 2004 * Beginning of ICT4D Research Program - ‚ÄòVirtual Villages; Socio-anthropological and technological study on last mile‚Äô - 2004 * Setting up Telecentre Family Network (in collaboration with eSrilanka program) as an apex telecentre alliance - 2006 * Design and implementation of Agri-clinics as a farmer centric information delivery mechanism - 2006 * Sarvodaya-Fusion being elected as the Regional Coordinator for GKP (Global Knowledge Partnership) South Asia - 2006 May * Launch of Sarvodaya-Fusion as a specialized ICT4D program of Sarvodaya - 2006 May Programs =Village Information Centers (VIC)= Village Information Centers are simple community based libraries. Their unique features include: * Simple, locally appropriate model * Ability to adapt to diverse rural demands * Community participation and ownership * Ability to build community aspirations towards the digital age. VICs are initiated by the youth leaders (volunteers) of rural villages. They are housed within low cost rural buildings, donated by the community. Some are maintained adjoining Sarvodaya Village Banks. VICs accumulate and manage basic livelihood information related to health, transport, agriculture, education and governance. There are VICs having enormous indigenous resources such as Traditional Medical Recipes (on Ola leaves), Indigenous crop harvest equipment, Storage systems, Traditional songs and books. Some VICs gather information related to local bio-diversity (birds, plant species etc.). =Telecentres= Telecentres are small units having a few computers and other ICT equipment located in rural districts. They provide internet access, ICT education and other IT services to rural communities. The majority of the telecentres with which Fusion partners are owned by rural communities, (mostly sponsored by the State sponsored eSriLanka program). Fusion maintains a small network of telecentres to carry out pilot projects, the knowledge obtained from which can finally be adopted by the wider community.

He was from Mill Creek Hundred, in New Castle County. He was a trustee of the Academy of Newark, and in 1817 sponsored a bill to allow it to raise $50,000 by lottery in order to raise funds to establish a college. The lottery did not go ahead, and in January 1821 Gray sponsored a second bill to establish a college, as \\"Delaware College\\", to be funded by a tax on steamboats and stagecoaches. The prospect of these new taxes was exceptionally unpopular, and Gray was defeated by an anti-college \\"Independent Democratic\\" ticket in the 1821 elections by a 2-1 margin.The University of Delaware: A History, Chapter 2 When Newark College was finally established in 1833, his three sons were sent there. He was appointed president of the trustees in 1839, succeeding Thomas Clayton, and was replaced by Eliphalet Wheeler Gilbert in April 1841. After being ousted as president, he sought an investigation of the fledgling college, accusing the trustees of financial mismanagement. On February 14, 1843, he presented a petition, stating that the college had been effectively taken over by the New School Presbyterians, and that it was heavily in debt. In order to allow it to survive into the future, he argued, it should be closed until the income from the endowment was sufficient to maintain it; otherwise, the endowment fund would quickly be spent on operating costs until there was nothing left. After some debate; his petition was rejected, and the college remained open.The University of Delaware: A History, Chapter 3 References Category:1849 deaths Category:Delaware state senators Category:University of Delaware people Category:Year of birth unknown Category:Delaware Democratic-Republicans ","title":"Andrew Gray (senator)"},{"id":"20124048","text":"Hiram Harrison Lowry (May 29, 1843 - January 13, 1924) was an educator, Methodist clergyman and college president in China.

The network's flagship is the Good Karma Brands's WTMJ in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, which has broadcast the games since November 24, 1929, and was the former flagship station of Journal Communications until the E. W. Scripps Company and Journal completed their broadcast merger and publishing spin-off on April 1, 2015 (Good Karma took over WTMJ's operations on November 1, 2018 upon Scripps' second withdrawal from radio).Packers, WTMJ Sign Long-Term Extension Of Radio Rights Agreement This is one of the few arrangements where a team's flagship radio station is not based in their home market and the local station serves as a network affiliate only, as WTMJ's signal to Green Bay and most of Wisconsin's population centers is city-grade; the rights for Packers games in the Green Bay area have bounced between Midwest Communications and Cumulus Media throughout the last few years, while stations carrying the games owned by Woodward Communications which nominally serve the Fox Cities exclusively have equally heavy listenership in Green Bay. Two internal Part 15 radio stations are operated within the area surrounding Lambeau Field during Packers home games. The first features the Packers Radio Network play-by-play, along with public address and scoreboard announcements, providing the game call to those in attendance without the delay experienced by the uploading of the network feed via satellite. Another station carries the game's television network audio. Both feeds are on non-standard FM frequencies below 87.5 FM MHz which require purchase of a special radio tuner from the team's pro shop to listen to that signal clearly (or an extended Japanese band FM tuner which can receive those frequencies), though it is audible with cross-channel interference from Wisconsin Public Radio's WPNE at 87.5 FM on regular tuners. The Green Bay stations designated below in the table are considered additional \\"primary\\" stations in the network. This designation only truly comes to use in the later stages of the NFL Playoffs if the Packers make it to the NFC Championship Game and the Super Bowl, where those primary stations can carry the Packers Radio Network local call. All other network stations, including those licensed to communities in the Fox Cities, must carry the national Westwood One call instead in line with NFL rules. In situations where Milwaukee Brewers baseball playoff games conflict with Packers games (WTMJ and Good Karma Brands also originate that team's broadcasts as the Brewers Radio Network) in September and October, WTMJ's FM sister station WKTI (94.5) originates the games in Milwaukee, with other stations in the Packers Radio Network making their own determinations about carriage of both games depending on whether they have a sister station to broadcast both games. WTMJ is simulcast on HD Radio over WKTI-HD2, in addition to the main AM signal's HD broadcast. Despite the NFL's Game Pass service nominally restricting WTMJ from streaming PRN coverage over the Internet, the station has streamed the team's games since the 2011 season, outside playoff games, though the streaming has been limited to desktop computers as of the 2015 NFL season due to both the new Game Pass package and TuneIn's premium service holding streaming rights for NFL play-by-play on mobile devices. Its primary programming consists of broadcasts of Packer home and away games to a network of 56 stations in Wisconsin, the U.P., Iowa, North Dakota, and South Dakota, along with a two- hour pre-game show and three-hour postgame show which allows listeners to call, email, or text in a sports talk format about the finished game. Wayne Larrivee has been the play-by-play announcer since 1999, while former Packer center Larry McCarren has worked as the color commentator since 1995. Both Larrivee and McCarren contribute to the team's television programs, in addition to work with WTMJ's television sister station WTMJ-TV in Milwaukee and WGBA-TV in Green Bay, where McCarren was sports director from 2013 until 2015 when he began to focus exclusively on his Packers network duties. Though its broadcasts began in 1929, WTMJ did not begin paying the Packers for broadcast rights until 1943; it paid the team $7500 to broadcast the season. In the early 1930s, there was no exclusive right given to broadcast games, and WHBY, then based in Green Bay, often sent its own announcers to call the game. From 1933 to 1936, three additional stations carried WTMJ's radio broadcasts of Packer games: WLBL in Stevens Point (a non-commercial station owned by the state commerce department decades before the creation of Wisconsin Public Radio), WTAQ in Green Bay and WKBH in La Crosse. WSAW in Wausau and WJMS in Ironwood, Michigan started carrying the feed in 1937.Randall Davidson, 9XM Talking: WHA Radio and the Wisconsin Idea.

The theatre was founded by the distinguished opera director and singing coach Enrica Clay Dillon in 1936 and is now owned and operated by the non-profit Deertrees Foundation. As home to the Deertrees Theatre Festival, the Sebago-Long Lake Music Festival, the BackStage Gallery, and the Salt Lick Cafe, Deertrees is one of the most active summer theatres in the Northeast. Listed on the National Register of Historic Places and the Maine Register of Historic Places, it is sanctioned by the Actors' Equity Association as \\"a small professional house.\\" The Theatre Designed in the Adirondack style by Harrison G. Wiseman and built by George Locke of Bridgton, the theatre was constructed of rose hemlock harvested on the property. The proscenium arch was made from whole tree trunks and the beams, doors, trim, and light fixtures were all handcarved. The building was designed so the entire auditorium with its pitched floor could be detached from the stage end and moved forward allowing an extra section with more seating inserted. It boasted a thirty- member orchestra pit, stage dimensions identical to the Metropolitan Opera House, and the best technical equipment of any theatre outside of New York.Davis, Sue (July 14, 2002) \\"A Jewel in the Forest\\". Boston Globe. Two large barn doors located behind the stage could be opened for an authentic forest backdrop. Whether by chance or design, the theatre also had near perfect acoustics. More than sixty years after the theatre first opened, Christopher Hyde, classical music critic for the Maine Sunday Telegram, theorized that the tight sheathing of rough hemlock and pre-stressed posts and beams created the effect of a large stringed instrument able to transmit vibrations efficiently without echoes or reverberation.Hyde, Christopher (August 6, 2006) \\"Maine's Grand Old Barns Make for Easy Listening\\" Portland Press Herald History The theatre's gala opening on August 15, 1936 featured a reading from Cyrano de Bergerac by the classical actor, Walter Hampden. Only two more productions were presented that summer but the following season Deertrees became a fixture on the straw hat circuit by presenting four different plays and a musical comedy with a cast of professional actors in repertory under the direction of Ms. Dillon. However, in 1938 the theatre failed to open and when Deertrees reopened in the summer of 1939 it was under the auspices of the noted Broadway producer Bela Blau Advertising \\"A New Play - A New Broadway A Star Every Week.\\"Price, Cathy (June 25, 2006) \\"Summer theater spelled D-e-e-r-t-r-e-e-s\\". Maine Sunday Telegram Blau imported an entire Broadway cast from New York City every week including such stars as Ethel Barrymore, Tallulah Bankhead, Edward Everett Horton, Dame May Whitty, and Rudy Vall√©e. A young David Merrick was a jack-of-all-trades apprenticeKissel, Howard (April 2000) David Merrick - The Abominable Showman: The Unauthorized Biography Applause Books and credited on several playbills as being the associate producer and the then unpublished Helene Hanff worked in the box office. Local talent augmented smaller roles as the need arose. In addition to the theatre, Blau operated a school for theatrical designers headed by Raoul Pene Du Bois. Following the death of Bela Blau in the autumn of 1940, Ms Dillon returned to her first love, opera. She inaugurated The Deertrees Opera Company with the young Edwin McArthur (later replaced by Karl Kritz) as musical director and George Wells as scenic and lighting designer. The company consisted of some 12 to 15 young singers including Astrid Varnay, Phila Tharpe, and Elizabeth Caron and was a forerunner to the great opera- training programs to come to America some fifty years later.Commanday, Robert (May 28, 2002) \\"Small Opera Can Be Big\\" San Francisco Classical Voice The Deertrees Opera Company continued into the summer of 1942 but with the United States in the war, after a Red Cross/U.S.O Benefit concert on August 31, the theatre went dark. In 1946, Ms. Dillon announced the re-opening of Deertrees Theatre for a \\"Summer Festival of Opera and Drama;\\" however, by mid-summer Ms. Dillon's health had deteriorated to the extent that she was unable to continue working and, on October 9, 1946, her brilliant career ended and the theatre closed. In 1949, New York attorney A. L. Sainer assumed responsibility for Deertrees and reopened the theatre under the management of his brother-in-law, actor/director Robert Harris. Mr. Harris ran Deertrees as an Equity repertory company, assembling casts from Broadway and Hollywood that included Peggy Allenby, Helene Reynolds, Margot Stevenson, Ferdi Hoffman, and William Tregoe. The internationally recognized designer Richardson Harrison Senie was appointed Scenic Artist and Cy Roossin, the Production Manager. The company presented mostly light comedies and farces such as For Love or Money and Petticoat Fever but the schedule also included dramatic productions of The Heiress, The Glass Menagerie, and Payment Deferred. In 1951, Harris returned to Hollywood and, once again, the theatre went dark. In August 1953, The Boothbay Playhouse Corporation, headed by Sherwood Keith, purchased the theater. As a step toward stimulating local theatres and decentralizing the American Theater from New York, Keith introduced a policy of utilizing community theatre groups. For two years, Mr. Keith presented outstanding repertory companies from throughout New England but the second season, after a gala opening night starring Mr. Keith and his wife in The Four-Poster, did not meet with great success and in 1956 he sold the theatre to Mrs. Aya Sholley. Mrs. Sholley appointed Emily Perry Bishop as resident director and brought in a small resident stock company to present a diverse program of dramas and matinees for children. However, by 1959, falling attendance and increased expenses had taken their toll, and in 1960 and 1961, the theatre failed to open. In 1962, Deertrees Theatre once again took a premiere place on the Summer Theater circuit. Under new management the theatre pursued a policy of resident players, as well as guest stars, most of whom were drawn from television. Ann B. \\"Schultzy\\" Davis opened the season in Everybody Loves Opal while Shirley Knight, rock idol Fabian, Allen Case, and John Saxon were some of the other luminaries making appearances. However, the enthusiasm did not last, the theatre closed at the end of that year, and it did not re-open for two years. In 1965, Mrs. Sholley presented her alma mater, Boston's Emerson College, with the deed to Deertrees. Under the direction of Dr. Michael E. Rutenberg the theatre was operated as part of the Emerson College Center for the Performing Arts, a division of the College set up for the purpose of allowing students the opportunity to operate a summer theatre as well as take the usual academic courses. Among the students associated with Deertrees during these years were Paul Kreppel, Andrea Martin, and Ron McClartney. Emerson continued the project through 1969 when it sold the property to a former student, David Maturi. Maturi and his Coventry Theatrical Community continued to use Emerson students for cast and technical crew and produced programs of comedies and musical comedies, including The Odd Couple, Mame, Cabaret, and Sweet Charity; at least the last three of which featured Cecilia Hart, then billed as Ceci Hart, in the roles of Agnes Gooch, Sally Bowles, and Charity Hope Valentine, respectively. However, once again failing attendance and increased expenses caused the theatre to close in 1971. After three years of being closed, a former student of Enrica Clay Dillon, Judith Ritter purchased the theatre. The 1975 season opened with a resident opera company performing Mozart's Cos√¨ fan tutte - not coincidentally, the last opera Enrica Clay Dillon produced before her death - and for the next three years, the theatre rotated between theatrical and operatic programs with \\"Twilight Pop Concerts\\" held on Sundays. In 1977, the Maine Opera Association made Deertrees its official home. In 1979, Frank Best leased the theatre from the Ritters and formed the Deertrees Performing Arts Festival as a non-profit corporation. However, his plans for three productions by the Maine Opera Guild, a professional theatre company, and a series of concerts ranging from bluegrass to ragtime failed to materialize and the theatre closed. By the mid-1980s, the theatre had been abandoned and considered a relic from a bygone era. The town of Harrison foreclosed on the property and there was consideration of burning the building as an exercise for the local fire department. Fortunately, a group of concerned citizens led by Dr. Al Mills and Sally MacAuslan undertook the rescue of the theatre and formed the Deertrees Foundation to restore the building and grounds. In 1990, the theatre once again opened. Mission and current operations The mission of Deertrees Theatre is to provide a diverse selection of quality cultural opportunities and to present entertainment of the highest professional standard at affordable prices and in a manner that upholds the illustrious tradition of this theatre. Deertrees Theatre is currently open each year from late June until early September and presents an eclectic mix of legitimate theatre, opera, music of all genres, comedy, and children programs.

He was an important figure in the establishment of free libraries in the United Kingdom. He died and is buried in Niton on the Isle of Wight. Early life and work Edwards was born in Stepney (London) on 14 December 1812. His father, Anthony Turner Edwards, was a builder and apprenticed his son to this trade at the age of fourteen. There is no record of Edwards' education and early employments. However, it is known that he attended the King's Weigh House chapel, where he was influenced by Rev. Thomas Binney. Also, Edwards received private lessons from Edwin Abbott and was, as his teacher, member of a German reading circle of the Marylebone Literary and Scientific Institution. In the 1830s, Edwards developed an interest for education, library and industrial art which may have had its roots in Edwards frequent attendance of the Society of Wranglers, a radical art and literary discussion club. Among the members of this society were George Godwin, Henry Hayward and Margaretta Hayward, sister of the latter and future wife of Edwards. After his father's business went bankrupt in 1832, young Edwards seems to have depended entirely on the financial compensation of his research and writing. In 1836 he published anonymously a pamphlet, in which he argued against various restrictions which at that time made education only accessible to a small elite. Later that year, Edwards published an open letter to Benjamin Hawes, who had sat on the parliamentary select committee on the British Museum. The letter contained numerous suggestions for the improvement of the museum library, including the proposal of longer opening hours to extend the use of the library to a wider class of person. As the letter caused much discussion in the academic world, a second edition of the letter was printed privately in 1839. Being a co-founder of the Art Union of London, Edwards was soon appointed its honorary secretary. In 1840, however, Edwards had to leave the union in disgrace, having squandered over ¬£300 of its funds. After some time of research in France, Edwards published a work on engravings by the process of Achille Collas. When Edwards returned to London, he was also asked by James Macarthur to help him with the research for his account of New South Wales. Edward's name did not appear in connection with the work, even though it was presumed that he wrote large parts of it. On 11 June 1844, Edwards married Margaretta Hayward, who he had met at the Society of Wranglers. Association with the British Museum Meanwhile, Edward's dedication to the subject of improving the library of the British Museum had attracted the attention of the authorities and when Edwards applied to Antonio Panizzi in 1838, the newly elected keeper of printed books was inclined to hear him. In 1839 Edwards joined the staff and became a supernumerary assistant in the printed book department, for especial employment on the new catalogue ordered by the trustees. Together with Panizzi, John Winter Jones, Thomas Watts and John Humffreys Parry, Edwards worked on the ninety-one rules for the formation of this new catalogue. Besides that, Edwards Edwards was assigned to the duty of cataloguing the Thomason collection of tracts and pamphlets printed during the English civil war, Commonwealth, and Restoration periods. In the late 1840s Edwards developed an interest for the statistics of libraries and comparative librarianship. His results which were often published in the Athenaeum were criticised by other librarians as little reliable. Mr. Watts, Edwards' colleague and one of his biggest opponents, wrote a series of corrective letters (also published in the Athenaeum) in consequence to Edward's articles, using the signature \\"Verificator\\". Nevertheless, Edwards had also gained supporters, the most prominent of which being William Ewart, who had also been involved in the Art Union of London and whose committee on free libraries in 1850 originated the Public Libraries Act. Association with the Manchester Free Library The librarianship of the first important free library established under Mr. Ewart's act was offered to Edwards, who was happy to accept as his superiors at the British Museum were frequently dissatisfied by his work ethic. Edwards accordingly became the first librarian of the Manchester Free Library soon after he was dismissed from the museum's library in 1850. During his time at the Manchester Free Library Edwards developed a classified catalogue which was published in 1855 in the form of a letter to Sir John Potter, chairman of the library committee. It was not long, however, until the management became aware of Edwards' frequent absences and his conduct of private research during work time which finally lead to his dismissal in 1858. Later life Biblioth√®que Sainte- Genevi√®ve from Edwards' Memoirs of Libraries After having been dismissed by two libraries, Edwards turned towards science, both in the fields of literature and librarianship. Aside from the works listed below, he also wrote several articles for the 8th edition of the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Edwards' biography of Sir Walter Raleigh has been praised particularly for the second volume, because it contained for the first time a complete edition of Raleigh's correspondence. The first volume containing the memoir, however, appeared almost simultaneously with that of James Augustus St. John and \\"it was remarked with surprise that each biography appeared to be deficient in whatever gave interest to the other, and that the two would need to be blended to produce a really satisfactory work\\". From 1870 to 1876 Edwards was engaged to catalogue the library of Queen's College, Oxford, which marked a happy period in his life only disturbed by the death his wife in 1876. On the formation of the Library Association in 1877 Edwards was proposed as its first president, but had to refuse due to deafness. Nevertheless, Edwards accepted working at the Bodleian Library from 1877 to 1883, calendaring the Carte papers. The Library Association elected Edwards as an honorary member in 1882 and in the same year he was asked to revise the articles Newspapers and Post Office for the ninth edition of the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. After Edwards was dismissed from his engagement at Oxford due to economic shortages, he retired to Niton, Isle of Wight, and occupied himself with projects for a second edition of his Memoirs of Libraries, with great alterations and improvements. Edwards spent his final years in poverty and was taken in rent-free by Rev. John Harrison, a Baptist minister, after having been thrown out for non- payment of rent. In November 1885, he got lost on an excursion and was found after several days \\"in a state of hypothermia sheltering inside a roofless building next to St. Catherine's Oratory and afterwards developed pneumonia\\". He found dead in his room on 7 February 1886, and was buried in the graveyard of the local Church of England church on 10 February. His grave remained unmarked until 1902 when his biographer Thomas Greenwood paid his debts and erected a monument over his grave.  Selected Works  * Edwards, Edward (1836): Metropolitan university.

History First known as Picnic Lake, the Geauga lake area was home to early settlers such as the Staffords, Mark Patterson, Capt. Simon Henry with his wife Rhoda Parsons and their children, Charles Swires, the Brewsters, and Bohan Blair. There is currently a city park and ballfields on East Blvd. in Aurora, named after this lake. Geauga Lake is situated in lot twenty-eight, tract three, and is the head water of Tinker's Creek which empties into Cuyahoga River. The waters of this lake are very pure and of great depth. Sullivan Giles, who chose the lake area for his log cabin in 1817, later built a large frame home on the spot behind Geauga Lake depot on the north side of the lake. When the railroad came to town in 1856, it made a stop at \\"pond station\\".Railroad Depots of Northeast Ohio Page 37 Mark J.

The park grabbed the attention of nearby residents and tourists visiting by train. Two years later, the park introduced its first amusement ride, and shortly thereafter added a roller rink, photo gallery, billiard hall and bowling alley. The bowling alley still stands and became the home of the Aurora V.F.W. The roller rink still stands and is also known as \\"the old ballroom\\". The amusement park operated until its permanent closure in 2007, although the water park that was added in 2005 ‚Äì Geauga Lake's Wildwater Kingdom ‚Äì continued to operate until 2016. On a bluff on the southeast side of the lake in 1888, the 75-room Kent House Hotel (later known as Hotel Grace) was built and operated by Alexander G. Kent. He presided over one of the finest ballroom dancing facilities in the area, located on the third floor of the hotel. The hotel was later destroyed by fire in the early 20th century. The Cleveland Ice company located their buildings here, which were annually packed with many thousand tons of ice, which was primarily shipped to Cleveland for market during the warmer months. Three professional baseball games were played at the park on Sundays (plus a Thursday exhibition game) in July and August 1888, by the Cleveland Forest Citys in the major league American Association before Sunday games were moved to Beyerle's Park closer to Cleveland in September 1888. At the time, a full-sized steamboat circled the lake, towing a large scow, topped with a dance floor. The boat, first owned by William Banford and Rowe Fuller, was later purchased by the Kents. In 1907, the boat was shipped by rail to Brady Lake near Kent.

It is published under the auspices of Professor R√ºdiger Wolfrum, Director of the Max Planck Institute for Comparative Public Law and International Law. The initiative to compile the MPEPIL began in 2004 and the online version launched in September 2008. It represents a new edition of the Encyclopedia of Public International Law published between 1991 and 2001 by Rudolf Bernhardt. In February 2012, the print editionMPEPIL print edition, Oxford University Press. was published by Oxford University Press. The encyclopedia is peer reviewed. In a 2013 review of the work, Sean D. Murphy wrote that: \\"All told, there is little question that the Max Planck Encyclopedia lives up to its claim as the definitive reference work for international law\\"Sean D. Murphy, Book Review of the Max Planck Encyclopedia of Public International Law (R√ºdiger Wolfrum, Ed., Oxford University Press, 2012) in 107 American Journal of International Law 510 (2013). Description MPEPIL is an updated, comprehensive work covering the essential topics in international law. The new work is not just a revision of Rudolf Bernhardt's encyclopedia. Instead, new authors completely rewrote nearly all entries. MPEPIL includes numerous new topics in order to capture the latest developments in international law. To do justice to the changing nature of the law, an increased emphasis has been be placed on the relevance of each keyword for contemporary international law. Particular attention has been paid to the contextualization of each topic within international law as well as the presentation of current trends while maintaining a focus on the mainstream/majority view. In order to reach the goal of avoiding a purely Eurocentric perspective the assistance of academics and practitioners from various legal backgrounds and perspectives was obtained already in the early stages of the undertaking. The intention is that MPEPIL is a work that reflects international law from a global perspective while taking into account also regional views. Contents MPEPIL currently contains 1,618 articles. A total of 1,700 articles are planned for the site, with four content updates per year. Upon completion, the MPEPIL will cover the following overarching subject areas and article types: * Air law and law of outer space * Diplomacy and consular relations * Foreign relations * History of international law * Human rights * Immunities * Individuals and non-state actors * International co-operation * International courts and tribunals * International criminal law * International economic law and relations * International environmental law * International humanitarian law * International organizations: general aspects * International procedural law * International responsibility * Law of the sea * Law of treaties * Overview articles * Procedural law in international organizations * Regional organizations, institutions and developments * Relationship between international and domestic law * Settlement of disputes * Sources, foundations and principles of international law * Specific armed conflicts * Specific cases and decisions * Specific geographic issues * Specific treaties and instruments * Statehood, jurisdiction of states, organs of states * Subjects of international law * Territory * Theories of international law * Universal international organizations and institutions * Use of force, war, peace and neutrality. Given that the information contained in many of the articles may become outdated, authors are asked to update their articles once a year in the first three years after electronic publication of the entire MPEPIL. Personnel and management =Contributors= Over 800 authors from around the globe (74 countries) have agreed to submit articles to the MPEPIL. Among them are not only distinguished professors, judges and legal practitioners, who are involved in international law, but also up-and-coming academics and researchers. The latter have been included in order to promote the progressive character of the MPEPIL. =Advisory Board= An Advisory Board, consisting of renowned experts in various fields of international law, applies its expertise to ensure the quality and excellence of each article. They carefully read and evaluate each article, keeping in mind the high standard of the publication. The members of the Advisory Board include: Rudolf Bernhardt, Armin von Bogdandy, Edith Brown Weiss, Jean-Pierre Cot, Yoram Dinstein, Thomas Franck, Jochen Abr.

It consists of 20 buildings on a site bordered by Scholes, Maujer, and Leonard Streets and Bushwick Avenue. The Williamsburg Houses were built in 1936‚Äì1938 under the auspices of the Housing Division of the Public Works Administration (PWA). The chief architect of the project was Richmond Shreve, and the design team of nine other architects was led by the Swiss-American modernist William Lescaze. The construction contract was awarded to Starrett Brothers & Eken. The designs called for the inclusion of modern art commissioned through the Federal Arts Project. New York City Council politician Rosie M√©ndez grew up in the development. The Williamsburg Houses were designated a New York City Landmark in 2003. History = Opening = Williamsburg Houses seen in 1941 The Williamsburg Houses were built in 1936‚Äì1938 under the auspices of the Housing Division of the Public Works Administration (PWA). The project was originally segregated, only allowing white residents. It was one of the first and most costly (in 1937 dollars) of New York City housing projects. New York City Mayor Fiorello La Guardia poured the first shovel of concrete for the project and was a strong supporter of the project despite its cost ($12.5 million in 1936).\\"La Guardia hails housing advance\\", The New York Times. April 15, 1936. Page 3. The site is the former home of Williamsburg Continuation School and the Finco Dye and Print Works Inc. The initial tenancy rents were set by WPA Secretary Ickes in August 1937, four months before the first tenants moved in. The building's commercial rents were also set, though within six months were decreased by 50%, a result of cheaper rents available in the nearby tenements. The housing developments were conveyed by the federal government to the NYCHA in 1957. A $70-million-dollar renovationLandmarks Preservation Commission Designation Report, LP-2135, June 24, 2003, p. 9. was done in 1999 by the NYCHA's architect David J. Burney. = Architects = The chief architect of the project was Richmond Shreve, and the design team of nine other architects was led by the Swiss-American modernist William Lescaze, whose Philadelphia Saving Fund Society building of 1928-32 was one of the first major International Style buildings in the United States. The construction contract was awarded to Starrett Brothers & Eken, which had worked closely with Shreve on the Empire State Building and later built the housing developments in Parkchester, Stuyvesant Town, and Peter Cooper Village. = Crime =  Design  = Features and architecture = Williamsburg Houses looking east on Leonard and Scholes Streets in 2012 The project is built approximately 25 acres standing between Maujer and Scholes Streets, and Leonard Street and Bushwick Avenue, its 20 four-story residential buildings occupy twelve city blocks. The buildings of the Williamsburg Houses are positioned to allow a sequence of courtyards, playgrounds, and ball courts between them; a school and community building are part of the site plan, and two curving pedestrian pathways cut through the grounds. all in three shapes; a capital ‚ÄúH‚Äù, lowercase ‚Äúh,‚Äù and a ‚ÄúT‚Äù shape. The ‚ÄúT‚Äù shaped buildings are in the middle of the complex with both ‚ÄúH‚Äù shaped buildings surrounding them. The houses are oriented towards the sun at a 15-degree angle. The facades on every building are colored in light tan bricks and building entrances marked by blue tiles and stainless steel canopies. = Art = Ilya Bolotowsky (pictured in 1938) with his artwork. Because of its innovative International Style design, the housing project designs called for the inclusion of modern art. Working with Lescaze, the NYC Federal Arts Project mural division, headed by abstract artist Burgoyne Diller, handled the commissions. Five abstract murals by Ilya Bolotowsky, Balcomb Greene, Paul Kelpe, and Albert Swinden were installed in basement meeting rooms in the late 1930s. Three of them long-covered over with paint, these murals were rediscovered in the late 1980s. After careful removal and restoration, the Williamsburg murals were installed at the Brooklyn Museum in 1990, where they remain on long-term loan from the NYCHA.William H. Honan, \\"Long-Lost Brooklyn Housing Murals are Being Restored\\", New York Times, July 20, 1988 Other artists received commissions for the project but their murals were ultimately not used. Stuart Davis painted a large semi-abstract mural entitled Swing Landscape for the project, but the work was instead sold by the Federal Art Gallery in New York, eventually landing up at the Indiana University Art Museum.Indiana University Art Museum website Francis Criss completed a 1938 oil-on-canvas mural called Sixth Avenue El, a realist abstraction of a Sixth Avenue El platform. The subject was timely, given that the elevated line was closed in late 1938 and razed in 1939. However, Criss's mural was never installed, instead being located at the Whitney Museum of American Art. According to Time magazine, it was rejected because the color scheme did not match the prescribed colors for the project.\\"Art: Architectural Painting\\", Time, June 6, 1938. Other artists engaged for the mural commissions were Jan Matulka, Byron Browne, George McNeil, Willem de Kooning, Harry Bowden, and Eugene Morley. Abstract sculptures, including work by Martin Craig and Jose de Rivera, were also part of the initial plans.Marlene Park and Gerald Markowitz, New Deal for Art: The Government Projects of the 1930s with Examples from New York City and State, Gallery Association of New York State, 1977, p. 53.Eleanor Carr, \\"New York Sculpture during the Federal Project,\\" Art Journal 31 (Summer 1972): 402.

Along with the Climate Change Bill and the Energy Bill this bill was considered by the Brown administration to be one of the \\"three legislative pillars of the Government's strategy to secure long-term prosperity and quality of life for all\\". Key aims * A new body, the Infrastructure Planning Commission would make the decisions * These decisions would be based on new national policy statements * Hearings and the decision- making process would be timetabled * The new regime would be used for major energy projects * The Secretary of State would not be able to have the final say on major infrastructure decisions * A new Community Infrastructure Levy on developments would finance infrastructure (money would be raised from developers to pay for the facilities needed as a consequence of new developments, such as schools, hospitals and sewage plants). * Planning appeals in relation to minor developments would be heard by a panel of local councillors and not by a planning inspector. Positions =Political parties= Labour Labour introduced the Bill that became the Planning Act, although some 60 Labour members signed a Commons Motion opposing plans to set up an independent commission in May 2008. Conservative The Conservatives were opposed to the Infrastructure Planning Commission while in opposition with parts of the act amended by the Coalition Government via the Localism Act 2011. Prime Minister David Cameron said before the 2010 election that \\"This quango is going to be almost entirely divorced from the processes of democracy. That is wrong. People need a planning system in which they feel they have a say ‚Äì both at national and local level. That is why this Bill is getting such widespread opposition from so many different quarters\\" The coalition government have, however, retained the concept of National Policy Statements, the authorisation regime and the Community Infrastructure Levy Liberal Democrats The Liberal Democrats were also opposed the Infrastructure Planning Commission. Previously opposed to nuclear power, they are also granted the ability to vote against the nuclear power National Policy Statement when it comes before Parliament. =Environmental groups= Friends of the Earth say that the government must make Climate Change a central consideration in the decision-making process. In November 2007 major environmental groups described the Planning Bill as a 'Developer's charter' and the head of planning at the RSPB expressed concern saying that although the minister claimed that the bill will help protect the environment that it was more likely to aid developers trying to push through major schemes with scant regard to wildlife and the countryside and could \\"fast track environmental harm\\". =Trade unions and businesses= John Cridland, then Deputy Director-General of the Confederation of British Industry supported the bill saying that it was in the national interest and would facilitate the building of infrastructure that will help Britain protect its energy security, build renewable power sources to cut carbon, and invest for the future\\". The Infrastructure Planning Commission (IPC) The Infrastructure Planning Commission was formed on 1 October 2009 with a brief to oversee planning applications for major infrastructure projects (also known as nationally significant infrastructure projects (NSIPs)) such as power stations, roads, railways and airports claiming to cut the time to make a decision from seven years to less than a year and saving the taxpayer ¬£300 million per year. Applications for large energy and transport projects had to be made to the IPC from 1 March 2010, but by December 2010 only two applications had in fact been made, one of which the IPC refused to accept as inadequately prepared. Despite claims that the general public would be cut out of the authorisation process, over 1000 representations were made on the application that the IPC accepted. Community Infrastructure Levy The Community Infrastructure Levy is a form of planning gain tax, where a proportion of the increase in value on land as a result of planning permission is used to finance the supporting infrastructure, such as schools and will 'unlock housing growth' Amendments =Localism Act 2011= The coalition government introduced the Localism Act 2011, that made changes to the regime under the Planning Act 2008. The Localism Act replaced the Infrastructure Planning Commission with the Planning Inspectorate, and returned overall decision-making to the Secretary of State who responds based on the recommendation of the Planning Inspectorate. The Localism Act also allows the House of Commons to be able to veto National Policy Statements, and makes other changes to the Planning Act regime. =The Infrastructure Planning (Radioactive Waste Geological Disposal Facilities) Order 2015= Amends sections 14 and appends section 30A to the Planning Act 2008.

International rugby career Packer was born in Chipping Norton and educated in the South of England, playing rugby at school boy level for Devon County and West Buckland School. After moving to Wales he became part of the Newport team, and while with Newport was selected to represent Wales as part of the 1891 Home Nations Championship. Under the captaincy of William Bowen, Packer was part of the squad which faced England at Newport in the opening game of the campaign, but after Wales lost, Packer was dropped from the team. It would take four seasons for Packer to be reselected, when he was chosen for the second and third game of the 1895 Championship this time led by Welsh rugby legend Arthur Gould. Wales lost the Scotland game, but Packer experienced his first international victory in the game against Ireland at the Cardiff Arms Park. Packer was selected for the entirety of the 1896 Championship, and was one of only three players from the pack to be retained during the Scotland game when the selectors brought in five new caps. Packer played his final international game the next year in a memorable win against England. This would be Wales' only game of the year after the team lost their international playing status due to the 'Gould Affair' In 1924 Packer was chosen to manage the British team on their tour of South Africa. =International matches played= WalesSmith (1980), pg 470. * 1891, 1896, 1897 * 1895, 1896 * 1895, 1896 Bibliography  * References Category:1868 births Category:1946 deaths Category:English rugby union players Category:Rugby union props Category:Newport RFC players Category:Wales international rugby union players Category:People from Chipping Norton ","title":"Harry Packer"},{"id":"20124454","text":"Ren√© Eckardt (born 22 February 1990) is a German professional football midfielder who plays for FC Carl Zeiss Jena.

A special case of this process was first discovered by Amihay Hanany and Edward Witten in 1996. All other known cases of Hanany‚ÄìWitten transitions are related to the original case via combinations of S-dualities and T-dualities.This effect can be expanded to string theory, 2 strings cross together resulting in the creation or destruction of a third string. The original effect The original Hanany‚ÄìWitten transition was discovered in type IIB superstring theory in flat, 10-dimensional Minkowski space. They considered a configuration of NS5-branes, D5-branes and D3-branes which today is called a Hanany‚ÄìWitten brane cartoon. They demonstrated that a subsector of the corresponding open string theory is described by a 3-dimensional Yang‚ÄìMills gauge theory. However they found that the string theory space of solutions, called the moduli space, only agreed with the known Yang-Mills moduli space if whenever an NS5-brane and a D5-brane cross, a D3-brane stretched between them is created or destroyed. They also presented various other arguments in support of their effect, such as a derivation from the worldvolume Wess‚ÄìZumino terms. This proof uses the fact that the flux from each brane renders the action of the other brane ill-defined if one does not include the D3-brane. =The S-rule= Furthermore, they discovered the S-rule, which states that in a supersymmetric configuration the number of D3-branes stretched between a D5-brane and an NS5-brane may only be equal to 0 or 1. Then the Hanany-Witten effect implies that after the D5-brane and the NS5-brane cross, if there was a single D3-brane stretched between them it will be destroyed, and if there was not one then one will be created. In other words, there cannot be more than one D3 brane that stretches between a D5 brane and an NS5 brane. Generalizations =(p,q) 5-branes= More generally, NS5-branes and D5-branes may form bound states known as (p,q) 5-branes. The above argument was extended in Branes and Supersymmetry Breaking in Three Dimensional Gauge Theories to the case of a (p,q) and a (p',q') 5-brane which cross. The authors found that the number of D3-branes created or destroyed must be equal to pq'-p'q. Furthmore they showed that this leads to a generalized S-rule, which states that in a supersymmetric configuration the number of D3-branes never goes negative upon crossing two 5-branes. If it does go negative, then the gauge theory exhibits spontaneous supersymmetry breaking. =Dual forms of the effect= Via a series of T-dualities one obtains the result that in any type II superstring theory, when an NS5-brane and a Dp-brane cross one necessarily creates or destroys a D(p-2)-brane. Lifting this statement to M-theory one finds that when two M5-branes cross, one creates or destroys an M2-brane. Using S-duality one may obtain transitions without NS5-brane. For example, when a D5-brane and a D3-cross one creates or destroys a fundamental string.

Biography Philippe Mius d‚ÄôEntremont was born in Normandy, France, and came to Acadia with his family in 1651 as a lieutenant-major with Charles de Saint-√âtienne de la Tour, who had been named Governor of Acadia by Louis XIII of France first in 1631, and again by Louis XIV in 1651. The governor in July 1653 awarded him one of the few fiefs to constitute territory in North America, the first in Acadia, and the second in all Canada, the Barony of Pobomcoup. Pobomcoup, meaning in Mi'kmaq \\"land from which the trees have been removed to fit it for cultivation\\", extended from Cap-N√®gre (Clyde River) to Cap-Fourchu (Yarmouth). He promoted agriculture on his seigneury and brought to his estate several indentured workers and a few families from Port- Royal. The settlement and d'Entremont's residence were established at Pubnico, the modern spelling of Pobomcoup. Pubnico is considered the oldest village in Nova Scotia still occupied by the Acadians, and also the oldest village in Canada still occupied by the descendants of its founder. In 1654, d'Entremont was captured by Major General Robert Sedgwick when he added Acadia to the British dominions after capturing the forts of Saint John, Port Royal, and the settlement of Penobscot. He did not resurface with his family until the colony was restored to France in 1670. At this time he was created a procureur du roi (King's attorney) in Acadia by Governor Hector d'Andign√© de Grandfontaine, a post he retained until 1687. At an advanced age, he left his seigneurial estate, bequeathing the title of baron to his eldest son Jacques, and resided with his eldest daughter until he died in 1701. The barony of Pobomcoup remained in the family until the Expulsion of the Acadians that began in 1755 by the British.

It is unclear whether the Maltese and Spanish surnames are related or a coincidence, perhaps caused by romanization.  Variations  Variations in spelling include: * Calleia: Anglicized variation of Maltese surname * Calleya: Variation found in Malta on documents dating from 13th century to 15th century, may be an Italianized variation. * Callea: Also found in Italy, this variation also shows up on documents from Malta dating from the 15th century * Kalleya * Callejas  Spain  In Spanish, Calleja can be translated to \\"narrow street\\" or \\"alley\\", but the Latin translation of Calleya is \\"skillfully\\". The surname is Castilian, originating in or around Ampuero in Cantabria, Spain.  Malta  Based on historical evidence, the Maltese version of the surname is likely not related to the Spanish version. The first written appearance of the Calleja surname in Malta predates both Aragonese rule (1283‚Äì1412) and Aragonese/Castilian rule (1412‚Äì1530) of the Maltese island‚Äîappearing in 1271 AD with the spelling Calleya and Caleya. On May 22, 1271, Bertrando de Real, the magister of Malta, was instructed to keep a note of the names and surnames of those who transported the falcons to the royal court from Malta; Martinus Calleya was a witness and Leo Caleya is among those included in the list.Melita Historica New Series. 12(1999)4(333-344), p.333, The Origin of the ‚ÄòMaltese‚Äô Surnames, Prof. Godfrey Wettinger Of note, the persons on the 1271 document belonged to the wealthy class and did not include any serfs or peasants, nor any surnames of Arabic derivation. One theory is that the surname Callea or Calleya in Malta is of late Greek or Byzantine formation‚ÄîCommendatore Francesco Abela, the father of Maltese history, believed the surname to be of Greek origin. In the fifteenth century there was a village in Malta called Calleja, situated near Mosta‚Äîit seems linguistically and geographically connected with il-Qlejgƒßa, in the same geographic area.Journal of Maltese Studies. 5(1968)(25-48) [p.25] The Distribution of Surnames in Malta in 1419 and the 1480s G.

University education After finishing his secondary education in Lagos, he moved to the United States for higher education both in SUNY Old Westbury and a year later, George Washington University. It was at this time that he met Uzikwendu and Ikechukwu, who was then an aspiring hip-hop artist out of Washington Heights, New York. The trio went on to form the World Famous Akademy, a brotherhood of musicians. They planned to grow into an independent record label but could not get their hands on the proper funds. Naeto C graduated in 2004 from the George Washington University with a BSc. in Biology, intending to go study further and become a medical doctor.

It is interdisciplinary and employs experts mainly in psychology, psychiatry, and the social sciences. In addition to carrying out research and related activities, the institute advises the Government of Norway in its areas of expertise and has some official emergency management functions at the national level. NKVTS has 101 employees. NKVTS was established by the Government of Norway in 2004 through the merger of four research institutions, mainly at the University of Oslo, and was wholly owned by the University of Oslo until 2019 when ownership was transferred to the Norwegian Research Centre, itself owned by four universities. While organised as an independent limited company, it remains an affiliated institute of the University of Oslo\\"Enheter ved Universitetet i Oslo\\", University of Oslo and cooperates closely with the Department of Psychology and the Faculty of Medicine, where several of its research professors also hold professorial chairs. The centre was located at Oslo University Hospital, Ullev√•l 2004‚Äì2013, and is now located in Nydalen, Oslo. NKVTS has its roots in the military and disaster psychiatry research of the University of Oslo and the Norwegian Armed Forces Joint Medical Services from the 1950s. Its oldest predecessor institution was the Division of Disaster Psychiatry, a joint unit of the University of Oslo Faculty of Medicine and the Norwegian Armed Forces, that was established by the chief psychiatrist of the Norwegian Armed Forces, Arne Sund, a pioneer in military psychiatry and the founder of the field of disaster psychiatry. Through Sund's efforts Norway became \\"an international pioneer in the research on mass killings, war, catastrophes, accidents and all forms of violence.\\" NKVTS has extensive international cooperation and has been represented in various UN bodies, such as the United Nations Committee against Torture.

From the 1960s military psychiatry research was carried out in cooperation between the University of Oslo and the Norwegian Armed Forces Joint Medical Services, and chief military psychiatrist Arne Sund established Norwegian military psychiatry as leading within NATO; Sund is also regarded as the founder of the newer field of disaster psychiatry. In 1978 the Division of Disaster Psychiatry was established as a formal unit within both the university and the Norwegian Armed Forces Joint Medical Services, with Sund as its director. Through Sund's efforts Norway became \\"an international pioneer in the research on mass killings, war, catastrophes, accidents and all forms of violence.\\"\\"Arne Sund,\\" Aftenposten, 28 December 2012, p. 15 In 1984 Sund was succeeded by military psychiatrist Lars Weis√¶th who led the institution until it became part of NKVTS. The Norwegian military's Stress Management Team for International Operations, established in 1996, was part of the Division of Disaster Psychiatry. The Psychosocial Team for Refugees was established by the government as part of the Directorate of Health in 1986, and became a centre at the University of Oslo in 1990. The two other institutions were established by the government in 1995 and 1996. The four institutions were merged to form NKVTS as a joint initiative of the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Justice and Public Security, the Ministry of Defence, the Ministry of Labour, and the Ministry of Children and Family Affairs. NKVTS is funded directly by the government. The institute was part of the University of Oslo from its establishment in 2004 until 2019, and remains an affiliated institute of the University of Oslo from 2019. The institute was located at Oslo University Hospital, Ullev√•l 2004‚Äì2013, and is now located in Nydalen, Oslo, in the immediate vicinity of the Ministry of Justice and Public Security. In 2018 the government proposed to integrate NKVTS into the Norwegian Institute of Public Health.Camilla Stoltenberg og Trygve Ottersen: Faglig styrke og integritet ved Folkehelseinstituttet In 2019 the government proposed that NKVTS continues as an independent state-owned research institute, and that the government's shares are administered by the Norwegian Research Centre, a research organisation owned by four universities; NKVTS maintains its close academic links with the University of Oslo as an affiliated institute. The centre has 101 employees (2019). It employs experts in psychology, psychiatry, law, sociology, criminology, social anthropology and other disciplines, with the main emphasis on psychology and psychiatry. Its academic staff include research professors (equivalent to full professors), senior researchers (associate professors), researchers (assistant professors) and a number of postdoctoral fellows, doctoral candidates and research assistants. NKVTS cooperates closely with the Department of Psychology, the Faculty of Medicine and the Faculty of Law at the University of Oslo, where several of its research professors also hold professorial chairs.

NKVTS also has several research projects on the psychological impact of natural catastrophes such as the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami, and on child soldiers in Africa, torture, traumatised refugees, war victims and soldiers, child sexual abuse and sexual violence, and violence in close relations. In addition to carrying out research the centre advises the Government of Norway in its areas of expertise. NKVTS has certain official functions related to emergency management at the national level. The current Director of the institute is Inger Elise Birkeland, a former political adviser to Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland. B.E. Saunders of the Medical University of South Carolina has described the institute as \\"one of the most highly respected research organizations in the world dedicated to research on violence and traumatic stress. Since its inception, it has conducted a series of highly sophisticated studies focusing on a wide array of topics, including the prevalence and impact of different forms of violence and abuse among children and adults, mental health treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder and other trauma-related problems, and how best to implement and incorporate evidence-based interventions practices into community service agencies.

The route enters the state from South Carolina near Calabash, and leaves in the vicinity of the Great Dismal Swamp National Wildlife Refuge in Virginia. Between the US 64 freeway and the Virginia state line, US 17 is a four-lane divided highway with speed limits varying between and . Route description US 17 enters Brunswick County in Carolina Shores amid a variety of golf course communities. Carolina Shores was part of Calabash until 1998. In Wilmington, US 17 (here concurrent with US 76 and US 421) crosses the Cape Fear River between New Hanover County and Brunswick County over the Cape Fear Memorial Bridge. US 17 then travels east through the city of Wilmington with US 76 on Wooster/Dawson Streets and Oleander Drive, intersecting US 117, NC 132 and US 74\\\\. At the end of the US 76 concurrency near Wrightsville Beach, US 17 travels north as Military Cutoff Road before meeting up with Market Street and US 17 Business and exiting the city northeast. North of Holly Ridge US 17 begins to move further away from the Atlantic Coast. Then, it bypasses Jacksonville along with NC 24\\\\. Between New Bern and James City, US 17 (concurrent with US 70 and NC 55) crosses the Trent River by way of the Freedom Memorial Bridge. Farther east, between James City and Bridgeton, US 17, still concurrent with NC 55, crosses the Neuse River over the Neuse River Bridge. Traffic going north on US 17 when using US 70's concurrency can bypass New Bern altogether via NC 43, ironically both the west end of US 17's concurrency on US 70 and NC 43's southern terminus both, respectively have a north and south protrusion of unused highway since full cloverleaf junctions were scrapped in the area. Elizabeth City In Washington, US 17 crosses the Pamlico River over the Pamlico-Tar River Bridge and intersects with NC 32 and US 264\\\\. Farther along in Bear Grass, US 17 joins a concurrency with a limited-access portion of US 13/US 64, although US 64 moves east before US 13/US 17 reaches Williamston, where the limited-access segment ends. US 13/US 17 uses the Roanoke River Bridge to cross the Roanoke River, then before US 13 moves onto the interchange with North King Street it crosses the Cashie River Bridge over the Cashie River at Windsor. At the Bertie County-Chowan County line, US 17 traverses the Chowan River from Edenhouse to Edenton. East of Edenton, US 17 shares a concurrency with NC 37 until they reach Hertford where it branches off to the northwest onto US 17 Business. US 17 crosses the Perquimans River via the Perquimans River Bridge. Between Perquimans County and Pasquotank County, US 17 crosses the Little River over the Little River Bridge. A bypass route splits off to the northwest as US 17 (Mainline) continues into Elizabeth City as Hughes Boulevard, picking up concurrency with US 158 until US 158 splits off to the west at Morgan's Corner. US 17 crosses the Pasquotank River between Morgan's Corner in Pasquotank County and South Mills in Camden County, before entering Virginia adjacent to the Great Dismal Swamp National Wildlife Refuge. History Historical Marker along US 17 US 17 was established in 1927, traversing from South Carolina, near Fair Bluff, to Virginia, near South Mills. Its routing was placed along the following state highways: NC 202, from the South Carolina state line to Chadbourn; NC 20, from Chadbourn to Wilmington; NC 30, from Wilmington to Windsor; NC 342, from Windsor to Elizabeth City; NC 34, from Elizabeth City to Morgans Corner; and NC 341, from Morgans Corner to the Virginia state line. In May 2015, AASHTO approved a request to reroute US 17 back through Wilmington, following US 76 along Oleander Drive and Military Cutoff Road. The justification for the route change was to better serve industry and commerce. In May 2017, US 17 was officially rerouted through Wilmington, ending its northern bypass route. =Interstate proposals= As a major north-south corridor through the coastal area, US 17 has been the target of various Interstate Highway proposals over the years. The earliest known proposal was in 1964, with a proposal supported by then-governor Terry Sanford, was to build a new Interstate from Fayetteville to Norfolk, Virginia, via US 13 and US 17\\\\. Designated Interstate 13 (I-13), it received support from various local officials; but was not supported by the North Carolina Highway Commission, which ended discussions. During the mid-1990s through mid-2000s, I-99 was proposed between Charleston, South Carolina and Wilmington, Delaware, completely overlapping all of US 17 in North Carolina. In 2006, the Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT) completed a study on the feasibility of the interstate and concluded with the high cost and disinterest of other states, notably South Carolina, that it was not feasible and recommend to not pursue further. In 2012, NCDOT backed and presented a letter to the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) requesting the establishment of a new high priority corridor between Raleigh and Norfolk, designated I-44 (or I-50, with I-56 and I-89 as other possible numbers). This corridor follows US 64 and US 17, north of Williamston. The following year, I-495 was established east of Raleigh and was routed on part of this proposed route. In 2014, various supporters, including Governor Pat McCrory, Congressman G. K. Butterfield, NCDOT and the Regional Transportation Alliance (RTA), have made cases and written letters to federal officials in support of the new interstate corridor. In 2016, AASHTO approved designation of I-87 along US 17 between Williamston and the Virginia state line. =North Carolina Highway 341= North Carolina Highway 341 (NC 341) was an original state highway that traversed from NC 34, in Morgans Corner, to South Mills. In 1923, it was extended north to the Virginia state line, meeting up with SR 40\\\\. In 1927, it was completely overlapped with US 17, which subsequently replaced it outright in 1934. Future In Chowan County, the existing freeway section of US 17, which bypasses Edenton, will be fully upgraded to modern interstate standards. At a cost of $13 million, it will mainly focus on widening travel lanes and building shoulders; construction is planned to start in 2025.

In 2006, the congregation of The Falls Church divided over the question of whether to leave the Episcopal Church, effectively creating two congregations: The Falls Church Anglican and The Falls Church (Episcopal). Following years of conflict within the Episcopal Church over issues surrounding Biblical authority and interpretation (including issues such as human sexuality, the role of men and women in ordained ministry, and liturgical reform) several congregations within the Episcopal Church concluded that the only way for them to remain faithful to their views was to \\"walk apart\\" from the Episcopal Church, yet remain in communion with other Anglican churches. The Falls Church was one of these congregations. In December 2006, a substantial majority of the congregation of the Falls Church voted to disaffiliate from the Episcopal Church in the United States of America and join the Convocation of Anglicans in North America, a missionary effort headed by Martyn Minns, former Rector of Truro Church, and sponsored by the Church of Nigeria, a member of Anglican Church in North America. In 2013, the Falls Church Anglican affiliated directly with the Anglican Church in North America. History =Colonial beginnings= The forerunner to The Falls Church appears to have been founded by landowner William Gunnell, who had moved from Westmoreland County, Virginia, in 1729. In the spring of 1730, he secured a minister and convened a congregation, which met in his home until 1733, when the first building was constructed. Until that time, this area was served by a clergyman who lived near present-day Quantico, and the nearest church was Pohick Church near Lorton. Known as \\"William Gunnell's Church\\", the new wooden structure was designed and built by Colonel Richard Blackburn, who was directed to construct a weatherboarded building forty feet by twenty-two feet, with a 13:12 pitch roof, and with interior work modeled on that of Pohick Church; the cost was 33,500 pounds of tobacco. Like Pohick Church, the new church served Truro Parish, which had been established by the colonial Virginia Assembly in May 1732 for the land north of the Occoquan River; Truro's first vestry met in November 1732. Michael Reagan allowed the church to be built on his land, but failed to grant the deed. John Trammell later bought the land and, in 1746, sold the two acre lot, including the church, the churchyard, and a spring, to the vestry of Truro Parish. By this point, it was known as the Upper Church. The Vestry Book first referred to it as the \\"Falls Church\\" on 28 November 1757, owing to its location at the intersection of the road to the Little Falls of the Potomac River (upstream of the Chain Bridge) and the Middle Turnpike (leading from Alexandria to Leesburg, now Virginia Route 7 or Leesburg Pike, called West Broad Street in downtown Falls Church City). George Mason was elected vestryman in 1748, as was George Washington in 1762. =The new brick church= By 1762, the wood building had fallen into decay and the vestry ordered a new brick building to be constructed on the same site. The next year, George Washington and George William Fairfax, as church wardens, assumed responsibility to contract for the new building. After 1765, this church became the seat of the new Fairfax Parish.Pohick Church, Minutes of the Vestry, Truro Parish, Virginia, 1732-1785 (Gateway Press, Baltimore, 1974), p. 58; transcription of Truro Vestry Minutes for February 19, 1749, ordering the rebuilding of the vestry house, the seat of the parish vestry, at Pohick Church in southern Fairfax County. The new church was designed by Colonel James Wren, a member of the vestry. Work commenced in 1767 and completed in late fall 1769. The Wren building remains on the site, between S. Washington, E. Broad, and E. Fairfax Streets. The 1769 structure is the oldest remaining church building north of Quantico in Virginia and is one of the oldest church structures in the United States. =Revolutionary War and aftermath= The Fairfax militia recruited from the church during the Revolutionary War, and it is said that at the war's end, the Declaration of Independence was read to citizens from the steps of the south doors. In 1784, the Commonwealth of Virginia revoked the status of the Anglican Church as state church. In 1789, The Falls Church was abandoned and remained unoccupied for almost 50 years; in 1836, it was reoccupied by an Episcopal congregation. Francis Scott Key was a lay reader of this congregation, as was Henry Fairfax, who used his own funds to restore the building during 1838 and 1839. =Civil War disruption and damage= During the American Civil War the church was used by Union troops as a hospital and later as a stable. Use of the building for worship services resumed after the war; the sanctuary has now been in continuous use since about 1873. The interior was repaired after the war, with the Federal government paying for damage caused by Union forces. Some of these repairs can be discerned in brickwork below the windows and in the lower part of the brick doorway at the west end of the church. The church was remodeled in 1908 and extensively renovated in 1959. Galleries in Wren's original design but never constructed were installed, and a new chancel was added. Other than repairs of war damage and the chancel addition, the structure reflects the original 1769 construction. =Separation from the Episcopal Church= The decision by the Falls Church Anglican to break away from the Episcopal Church stemmed from increasing dissatisfaction within the majority of the congregation over the direction being taken by the Episcopal Church. Several episodes contributed to the widening split, including the failure of the 2006 Episcopal convention to \\"confirm Christ as Lord\\" and the consecration of Gene Robinson, a partnered gay man, as Bishop of New Hampshire. In the view of many congregants, the Episcopal Church by these actions had violated its own constitution. These congregants concluded that to stay true to their traditional beliefs, they must separate. A vote was taken and 90 percent of the parishioners decided to leave the Episcopal Church to join the breakaway Convocation of Anglicans in North America, and 96 percent voted to hold on the property currently used. A minority faction, however, voted to remain part of the Episcopal Church. The majority group renamed itself The Falls Church (Anglican), while the minority faction took the name The Falls Church (Episcopal). However, both congregations claim 1732 as their founding date, and the same history through 2006. Following a lengthy court dispute around the property, ended in 2012, a minority faction that voted to remain part of the Episcopal Church was awarded ownership of the church property, and the Anglican congregation parish of 3000 people had to move to nearby rented locations. In June 2015 the Falls Church Anglican purchased land near the original church, with the intention of building a new church in the next years. The purchase will cost the parishioners $54 million ($31 million for the acquisition and an additional $23 million for new construction). On September 8, 2019, Falls Church Anglican celebrated its first worship service in their new facility. Since the 2006 split from the Episcopal Church, the Falls Church Anglican has been able to expand, by being able to fund and staff three more independent \\"daughter\\" Anglican churches: Christ Church in Vienna, Restoration Anglican, Arlington in Alexandria, and Winchester Anglican in Winchester.

It stands by the River Tweed in the former county of Selkirkshire, north-west of Selkirk, and south of Edinburgh. The name comes from the old Scots word for a fish trap. The estate is centred on Yair House, which is protected as a category A listed building. The nearby Yair Bridge is also category A listed. History In 1156 King Malcolm allowed the monks of Kelso to build a dam on the River Tweed, creating a pool for fishing. Yair House was built by Alexander Pringle of Whytbank (1747‚Äì1827) in 1788. It is a Georgian house of three storeys, with a large bay to the front. Pringle made his fortune in India, and re-purchased the family estates on his return. These estates, which included Whytbank Tower on the north side of the river, had been Pringle property since the 16th century, but were sold in the early 18th century to pay debts. The designer of the new house was William Elliot, a Kelso-based architect who designed The Haining in Selkirk, for another Pringle, in 1794. Yair Bridge Yair Bridge lies downstream from the house. It was constructed around 1764, and designed by the Edinburgh architect William Mylne (1734‚Äì1790). The three-arch stone bridge now carries the A707 across the Tweed. Outdoor access Yair Hill Forest is one of many forests in the Borders managed by Forestry and Land Scotland (FLS). It is located to the south and west of the house on Craig Hill (382m) and on Three Brethren (484m). Three Brethren is named after three stone mounds built in the 16th century by the lairds of Yair, Philiphaugh and Selkirk, to mark the boundaries of their lands. Access to the forest is at Lindinney car park on the A707, close to Yair Bridge. The Yair Grazings car park, at the north-west edge of the forest, allows access to Yair Wood, and nearby Glenkinnon car park is the access point for a biodiversity trail. Part of the forest is Lindinny Community Woodland, which is being restored from coniferous to native woodland by FCS and the Borders Forest Trust. The Southern Upland Way passes through the estate, descending from Three Brethren and crossing Yair Bridge. The Sir Walter Scott Way follows the same route. Below Yair is the Fairnilee slalom site on the River Tweed, used for canoe slalom. The Yair and the River Tweed generally remain popular salmon fishing sites. Yair House is not open to the public, though the gardens are occasionally opened for charity as part of Scotland's Gardens Scheme.

It was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature and was entered into the 1963 Cannes Film Festival. Overview The film offers an overview of Brazil, from the history of the country to the most recent developments at the time of its making - including developments of the industry and the new capital Bras√≠lia. It starts with an overview of the country itself and its history, and then proceeds to the social structure and social changes brought by industrialization and other development in recent years. Style The film does neither follow the camera- and editing-conventions of documentary films in the early 1960s, nor their narrative style. Instead, it uses experimental camera and editing techniques, often set to different kinds of music and electronic sounds by Oskar Sala. The voice-over-narration of the film (provided by Hugo Niebeling himself) only occasionally tells the viewer details about what they are seeing, often letting impressions speak for themselves. According to Hugo Niebeling, due to its tight connection of music and visual style, Alvorada is also his first \\"music film\\".

The act provided pensions for all veterans who had served at least ninety days in the Union military or naval forces, were honorably discharged from service and were unable to perform manual labor, regardless of their financial situation or when the disability was suffered. The bill was a source of contentious debate and only passed after Grover Cleveland had vetoed a previous version in 1887.  Background  The issue of pensions for Civil War veterans had been discussed since the 1860s. In 1862, a basic system was established which granted pensions to soldiers who could provide proof of time spent in the military and a disability incurred while in service. Under this system, pension money could be collected from the date of discharge if claims were filed within one year of that date. However, if claims were filed past this date, receipt of pension payment began on the date of application. This last issue was addressed in the Arrears of Pension Act of 1879, which allowed all Union veterans to reapply for pension and receive back payments to the date of their discharge, regardless of when they may have previously applied. This legislation did not change the requirement that disabilities be service- related but was nevertheless a very expensive bill that set the stage for the larger fight to come. Veterans could now receive large sums of money for several years of \\"missed\\" pension payments. This resulted in a flood of applications and a large increase in pension expenditures for the federal government.  The Grand Army of the Republic  It was in part the Arrears Act that politically reinvigorated the Grand Army of the Republic (GAR), an organization consisting mostly of Union veterans. With the political assistance of the Republican Party, which opposed the Democratic Party on the issue of pensions, the GAR became much more active in the call for liberal pension legislation following passage of the Arrears Act. Proposals favored by the GAR were generally either service pension plans or disability pension plans. Service plans included pensions for any Union veteran, given that he served some minimal term in the armed forces. Disability plans more closely represented the final bill passed in 1890 and included pensions for any veteran incapacitated by a disability, regardless of how it was sustained.  First Attempt  The first comprehensive pension disability bill was put together in 1887. This bill was almost identical to the bill to be passed in 1890 in that it granted pensions to all Union veterans suffering from a disability, regardless of its origin. However, it was distinct from the 1890 bill in two ways. First, it awarded all eligible veterans a $12 monthly pension. This differed from the Dependent and Disability Act, which gave pensions worth between $6 and $12 depending on the severity of the disability in question. Second, it required applicants to prove that they were financially dependent on another source, a feature that was absent from the final version of the bill passed in 1890. Although many lawmakers expected Cleveland to sign the bill, he instead vetoed it on February 11, infuriating the GAR and ensuring that pensions would be a central issue in the 1888 election. Cleveland‚Äôs primary objections to the bill were that it would be extremely costly, that determining the extent to which applicants were dependent on others would be too difficult, that the pension was ungraded and that the system would be abused by fraud. The bill returned to the House but did not garner enough votes to override the President‚Äôs veto.  1888 Election and Act's Passage  When the 1888 election rolled around, the GAR was at the peak of its political influence and, refusing to back down, carried the fight into the 1888 election. The Republican Party nominated Civil War veteran Benjamin Harrison to run against the incumbent Cleveland, promising to push for more extensive pensions and winning the support of the GAR in the process. Cleveland won the popular vote but Harrison won the crucial swing states of Indiana and New York, which contained 38,000 and 45,000 veterans receiving pensions respectively. The Republican Party‚Äôs pension rhetoric may have proved indispensable in these two states; Harrison captured them by just 2,300 and 13,000 votes respectively. Following his inauguration, Harrison reorganized the Pension Bureau and appointed James Tanner as the new commissioner of pensions. Although there was widespread corruption under Tanner and his successor Green Raum, Congress continued moving toward legislation aimed at expanding the federal pension program. Harrison pushed for a disability bill, which ultimately passed without a single vote from a Southern congressman. Under the final form of the law, any disabled Union veteran who had served at least ninety days was eligible to receive a pension, regardless of whether or not his disability was incurred in service. The final version of the act also allowed for the collection of pensions by widows of veterans and for children under the age of 16.  Impact  The Disability and Dependent Pension Act was, according to the GAR national pension committee, ‚Äúthe most liberal pension measure ever passed by any legislative body in the world.‚Äù It resulted in an enormous spike in federal expenditures on pensions. In 1890, just 537,944 veterans were receiving pensions. By 1893, that number had already almost doubled to 966,012. In 1889, the federal government spent $89,000,000 on these pensions, a figure that jumped to $159,000,000 by 1893. By 1894, 37% of the government budget was set aside for pension payments. As the ‚Äúlargest single appropriation ever made for a government expenditure‚Äù the act paved the way for future government pension spending. It would take another step in 1904 when an Executive Order was issued by Theodore Roosevelt declaring all veterans over the age of 62 to be eligible for a pension, effectively making old age a disability.

Peck (1802‚Äì1875), a prominent abolitionist of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. John Peck, a native of Hagerstown, Maryland, was a barber, wigmaker, and minister who was active in cultural and antislavery activities in and around Pittsburgh, where he lived after 1837.

After his two years of study with Gazzam, Peck entered Rush Medical College, Chicago, Illinois, in autumn 1846, and graduated in 1847. During the summer after graduation, Peck toured the state of Ohio with William Lloyd Garrison and Frederick Douglass. He set up a medical practice in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1848. He married Mary Lewis in Chicago in 1849. When his medical practice in Philadelphia proved unsuccessful, he returned to Pittsburgh in 1850. At the suggestion of Martin R. Delany, Peck moved to San Juan del Norte, Nicaragua, in early 1852. Peck was killed in spring 1855 in a skirmish between Democratic forces and their Republican rivals at Jalteva, Nicaragua (near Granada). The latter forces had been deposed after an election in 1854. Peck's death is recollected by Charles William Doubleday (1829‚Äì1909) in Chapter 4 of his Reminiscences of the 'Filibuster' War in Nicaragua.Charles W.

Tanner (April 4, 1844 ‚Äì October 2, 1927) was an American soldier and civil servant. He is best known for having lost both his legs below the knee at the Second Battle of Bull Run. Serving during the rest of the war as a government stenographer, he was present at the death of Abraham Lincoln and took notes that are the most comprehensive record of the events of the President's assassination. He later served as the United States Commissioner of Pensions, and helped reorganize and incorporate the American Red Cross. Early life and military career Tanner was born on a farm near Richmondville, New York, on April 4, 1844. He worked on the farm most of the year and was educated in the local public schools, graduating from high school at the age of 16. He took courses at a business school for a year, and then taught public school for a few months in a neighboring school district. Tanner was just 17 years old when the American Civil War broke out in April 1861. He enlisted in Company C of the 87th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment, and was quickly promoted to corporal.Combined Military Service Record (The title \\"Corporal\\" stuck with him for the rest of his life as a nickname.) He saw action in the Peninsula Campaign (March‚ÄìJuly 1862), fighting at the Siege of Yorktown (April 5 to May 4, 1862), the Battle of Williamsburg (May 5, 1862), the Battle of Seven Pines (May 31-June 1, 1862), the Seven Days Battles (June 25 to July 1, 1862), and the Battle of Malvern Hill (July 1, 1862). He then saw action at the Battle of Thoroughfare Gap (August 28, 1862), the Battle of Bristoe Station (August 26, 1862), and the Battle of Manassas Station (August 27, 1862). The last time he saw action was at the Second Battle of Bull Run, August 28‚Äì30, 1862. As Confederate artillery shelled his unit's position on August 30, shrapnel tore off his left foot and shattered his left leg below the knee. Union surgeons amputated both legs about below the knee. With the Union army in retreat, Tanner was left behind to be cared for by a local farmer's family. He was captured by Confederate forces. Paroled after 10 days, he spent several weeks recovering in Fairfax Seminary Hospital before being sent home to New York. He learned to walk with artificial limbs. For his service and injuries, he received a Civil War Pension.Approved Pension File for Corporal James Tanner Civil wartime service Tanner won a position as deputy doorkeeper for the New York State Assembly, then worked in a variety of positions of increasing responsibility for the next few months. During this time, he learned stenography. In October 1864, Tanner won an appointment as a clerk and stenographer in the Ordnance Department in Washington, D.C. On April 14, 1865, he was summoned to the Petersen House where Abraham Lincoln lay dying from an assassin's bullet. During the night, Tanner took the testimony of eyewitnesses to the assassination, and he was present in the room when Lincoln died at 7:22 A.M. on April 15. Post-war career Tanner left the Ordnance Department in December 1865 and moved back to Richmondville, New York. He took a job as a clerk of a committee in the state legislature, studied law with Judge William C. Lamont, and was admitted to the bar in 1869. He married Mero L. White, daughter of Alfred C. White of Jefferson, New York, in 1866. The couple had two sons (James A. and Earle W.) and two daughters (Ada and Antoinette). Very active in Republican politics, Tanner won a patronage position as a clerk in the New York Custom House in New York City in 1869. He was promoted to deputy customs collector and served for four years under Chester A. Arthur, the Collector of the Port. Tanner ran for a seat in the New York State Assembly in 1871, but lost in what many considered were fraudulent elections. He ran for registrar of deeds and wills in Kings County, New York, in 1876, but lost again. In November 1877, Tanner was appointed tax collector for the city of Brooklyn, New York. He held the position for eight years. He allowed citizens to pay their taxes by mail, which was a major innovation at the time. Under Tanner, annual tax collections rose from $400,000 to $2 million a year. In 1884, he ran for sheriff, but was again defeated. The election of a Democratic city administration in 1886 forced him from office, and he became a popular public speaker on the chataqua circuit. Tanner was frequently called on to lobby Congress on behalf of veterans and made many speeches in favor of Benjamin Harrison's presidential candidacy. Tanner was appointed Commissioner of Pensions on March 23, 1889. He supervised the operations of the Bureau of Pensions for just five months, however. His willingness to hire disabled veterans rather than party hacks and his desire to \\"treat the boys liberally\\" and loosen rules so that veterans could more easily qualify for pensions led to an investigation by Secretary of the Interior John W. Noble, Tanner's superior. President Harrison then requested his resignation. He resigned on September 12, 1889. Leaving government service a second time, Tanner opened a legal practice dedicated to helping veterans win pension claims against the federal government. From 1889 until 1904, Tanner was a private pension attorney engaged in prosecuting various claims against the government. In January 1894, his legs were amputated a second time in an attempt to reduce the extreme pain from which he suffered. President Theodore Roosevelt appointed Tanner to be Register of Wills for the District of Columbia in April 1904. He held the position until his death. Work with veterans' organizations and Red Cross Tanner became a member of the Grand Army of the Republic (GAR) shortly after it formed. The organization was a fraternal association for military veterans who had served in Union armies during the Civil War. His fame as a disabled veteran and witness to the Lincoln assassination made him popular among GAR members, and in 1876 they elected him Commander of the New York state organization. Many attempts had been made in the previous decade to create an old soldiers' home in the state, but none of these efforts bore any fruit. Tanner was determined to see one built by the state. He enlisted the help of the Reverend Henry Ward Beecher, a noted abolitionist and firebrand preacher, and held an organizing meeting in Brooklyn which raised $13,000 ($). Tanner then criss-crossed the state numerous times, making speeches and holding rallies. Tanner's efforts were so successful that in 1879 the New York State Legislature appropriated money for a 600-bed Soldiers' Home in Bath, New York. He later successfully campaigned for a home for Confederate veterans in Richmond, Virginia. Tanner was elected National Commander of the GAR in 1905. In 1912, the United Daughters of the Confederacy invited him to the ceremony for the laying of the cornerstone for the Confederate Memorial in Arlington National Cemetery. Such was his fame that he was asked on the spot to deliver short remarks to the assembled Confederate veterans (even though he was not scheduled to speak).\\"Begin U.C.V. Shaft.\\" Washington Post. November 13, 1912. Tanner was also a member of the Union Veteran Legion, and was elected national commander of that association as well. Tanner was also active in the American Red Cross. Clara Barton founded the organization in 1881 and led it for almost a quarter century. But by the early 1900s, Barton's leadership had devolved into a cult of personality and the organization's finances were in severe straits. Barton was forced out, and new leadership established a more professional and bureaucratic organization. Among those elected to the Red Cross' board of directors was James Tanner. Tanner worked assiduously to win a Congressional charter for the reorganized American Red Cross, which was granted in 1904. Tanner later served on the organization's central committee and its executive committee. Death amphitheater named for him in May 2014. Tanner died a few minutes after 8:00 P.M. on October 2, 1927, in Washington, D.C. He was buried at Arlington National Cemetery near Washington, D.C. Legacy In May 2014, Arlington National Cemetery officials formally redesignated the Old Amphitheater as the James Tanner Amphitheater. Tanner is buried in Section 2, Grave 877, a few yards from the amphitheater. References Bibliography * Marten, James.

History The school was officially opened on 3 August 1920 and historically catered for the Indian community during apartheid. The school was referred to as \\"Stanger State Indian High School\\" during the Apartheid era. Learners The school caters for learners from a vast range of communities. Feeder schools are mainly Kwadukuza Primary (located directly opposite Stanger Secondary), Dawnview Primary and Ashram Primary. About 70% of the learners come from historically disadvantaged backgrounds. An ex-learner of notable reference is former national education minister Kader Asmal. International Link Since 2004 Stanger Secondary School has been part of a \\"twinning agreement\\" with two schools in the United Kingdom - Cornwallis School and Beauchamp College. This link has yielded many benefits. Key examples of benefits include books, computers and skills. Internet connectivity was established in 2005 and, for the first time, an email was sent from within the school. Fundanami Learning Centre One of the most significant benefits Stanger Secondary has gained from the twinning agreement is the construction of a state-of-the-art Learning Centre at the heart of the school. This centre was named \\"Fundanami\\" by the learners of the school. \\"Fundanami\\" is an Isizulu word meaning \\"Learn With Me\\". Construction began in May 2008 and completed in November 2008. The Centre was officially opened on 19 March 2009 in a function graced by many local representatives in education as well as the Kwazulu Natal Minister of Education, Ina Cronje. The Centre's first manager was Mrs E. Hendricks. The centre aims to be a multimedia and literacy hub. Literacy, being a major problem in the school, is tackled by means of a Reading Assistance Programme. Since the start of 2009, reading assists were employed by the Fundanami Trust to assist Grade 8 learners who possess a very low reading age. The learners are identified by means of a Reading Test conducted early in the academic year. Learners who progress in their reading age are rewarded with a Participation Certificate. The first two certificates were presented at the centre's official opening on 19 March 2009 by Mike Wood of the Fundanami Trust. In addition to the Reading Programme, the centre is also utilized for a period called \\"Special English\\" (for Grades 8 to 12) - basically a Library Period where learners are encouraged to borrow books and read. Participation in International Conference One of the benefits of the twinning agreement with Cornwallis is the school's active participation in an annual international conference on student leadership. In 2007 Mrs P. Nasaree (Head of Department - Languages) participated in the conference held in L√ºnen, Germany. With her, two learners, Raihanna Suliman and Mandisa Mlambo represented South Africa. In 2008, Mrs Nasaree together with learners Nkululeko Mzimela and Sarika Chunilal attended the conference in Leicester, England. The October 2009 conference was held in South Africa with delegates from the United Kingdom (including one Yusuf Patel who used to live in South Africa), Germany and India participating. In addition, delegates from several local schools participated. The October 2010 conference was held in Germany with delegates from the United Kingdom, Germany, India, France and Sweden participating. In addition, delegates from several local schools participated. Learners from our school who participated were Ruvarashe Ndoora, Shabana Ali, Nomathemba Madlala and Zahraa Moolla. The 2011 International Conference was hosted by Beauchamp College in the United Kingdom in Leicester, England featuring South Africa, England and Sweden. Two learners, Vaughn Naicker and Nqobile Mchunu, had attended this conference in October 2011. 2012's participants to Sweden were Alvina Rajmoney and Mvelo Zikhali. Staff The current principal is Mr Bhekisisa A Mhlongo (appointed May 2020). The deputy principals are Mrs P Nasaree and Mr A Francis (acting). The school is manned by a staff of approximately 40 educators. The school is additionally managed by a team of Head of Departments, who also manages a specific grade. School Management The school follows a 5-day cycled Time Table. There are six 55-minute periods in each school day. The school is arranged with Teacher- Based Specialist Rooms. Hence learners move from class-to-class depending on the Time Table. This method is preferred as the subject teacher can host a range of equipment and learning aids in their Specialist Room - thus benefiting the learner. The movement is kept to minimal, however, by careful allocation of Specialised Rooms. Learners are expected to wear a specialised uniform. Boys wear a grey trousers, white shirt and school tie (blue, with white stripes). Girls wear a check blue and white dress. As of early 2014, the school introduced golf-shirts for the boys. Due to Stanger Secondary's proximity to a tarred road and the fact that it has electricity and running water, it is classed a Quintile 4 fee-charging school. School fees in 2020 was set at ZAR1750-00. Learners from disadvantaged backgrounds may apply for a concession. Curriculum The school covers a vast range of Learning Areas. All lessons are conducted in English. (Except for lessons in the Additional Languages.) Grades 8 and 9 cover the standard GET phase subjects: LLC English LLC Afrikaans or Isizulu Mathematics Natural Sciences (Combined Physical Science and Life Science) Social Sciences (Combined Geography and History) Life Orientation Creative Arts Economic and Management Sciences (Combined Accounting and Business Studies) Technology In addition, Grades 8's and 9's are trained with basic computer skills in a non-examined subject called Computer Literacy. Grades 10, 11, 12 cover standard CAPS subjects ranging from sciences (Physics, Life Sciences) to vocational subjects like Tourism and Consumer Studies. In 2013, the school has re-introduced Information Technology into its curriculum. English, Afrikaans OR Isizulu, Life Orientation and Mathematics OR Mathematical Literacy are compulsory. The learner chooses three elective subjects. The school's many decades have produced a high number of professionals in society. Learners are guided on Course Selection right from Grade 9 when crucial decisions are made.

During the war, he was active in the Warsaw Ghetto, helping smuggle in arms in preparation for the 1943 Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. After Poland's liberation from German occupation, he emigrated to the United States and wrote his autobiography, Five Years in the Warsaw Ghetto (originally titled The Stars Bear Witness). Life Goldstein was a leader in the Bund movement in Poland, and was active in the Warsaw Ghetto Resistance. During the time he spent living in and organizing resistance against the Nazis in the Ghetto, Nazi Germany systematically murdered half a million Jews once resident there. Over a year after the German Army had reduced the Warsaw Ghetto to rubble in liquidating its remaining Jewish occupants, Socialist resister survivors were rounded up by the Soviets and either imprisoned or executed. Throughout the occupation, in spite of numerous confidence tricks by the Nazis and their assistants in the Jewish Gestapo to produce docility in the Ghetto population by labeling the forced removals to Treblinka as mere \\"work resettlement,\\" Goldstein remained adamant that the Nazis were in fact gradually liquidating the Ghetto's residents. Via underground publications, Goldstein urged the Ghetto population to resist the German Army at all costs and not to cooperate with the Jewish collaborators whom the Gestapo controlled. When deportations started, his organization manufactured fake documents for those marked for liquidation. When it became clear the Nazis were planning to kill everyone, Goldstein helped organize the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising which ultimately ended in the Ghetto's destruction. Escaping the Ghetto, Goldstein joined the Polish resistance and helped stage the following year's citywide 1944 Warsaw Uprising. In 1945 Goldstein emigrated to the US. In the book Five Years in the Warsaw Ghetto he described the life prevailing in the ghetto and the heroic struggle of Jewish soldiers. His authority in Bund leadership, which he enjoyed before the war and his position in the Jewish underground during the war, described him in contemporary world historiography as the chronicler of the last hours of Jewish Warsaw.

Labadist community After the death of the pietist Jean de Labadie in 1674, his followers set up a community in Wieuwerd at the stately Walt(h)a Castle that belonged to three of them, the sisters Van Aerssen van Sommelsdijck.Details on the Waltha or Thetinga estate Drawing and map of the estate by Johann Andreas Graff, Merian's husband Here, the Labadists engaged in printing and many other occupations, including farming and milling. The original settlers included the famed poet, painter and scholar Anna van Schurman, who died in Wieuwerd in 1678. One member, Hendrik van Deventer, skilled in chemistry and medicine, set up a laboratory at the house and treated many people, including Christian V, the King of Denmark. Several other noted visitors have left their accounts of visits to the Labadist community. One was Sophie of Hanover, mother of King George I of Great Britain; another was William Penn, the Quaker pioneer, who gave his name to the US state of Pennsylvania; a third was the English philosopher John Locke. Between 1685 and 1691, the naturalist and scientific illustrator Maria Sibylla Merian stayed at the community in Wieuwerd with her daughters Johanna Helena and Dorothea Maria. Merian's husband was refused by the Labadists, but came back twice. Several Reformed pastors left their parishes to live in community at Wieuwerd. At its peak, the community numbered around 600 with many more adherents further afield. Visitors came from England, Italy, Poland and elsewhere, though not all approved of the strict discipline, separatism and community property.Wolfgang Kl√∂tzer (Hrsg.): Frankfurter Biographie. Zweiter Band M‚ÄìZ. Verlag Waldemar Kramer, Frankfurt am Main 1996, The community lasted until 1730. Mummies The basement of the Nicolas Church of Wiuwert houses four natural mummies dating back to the beginning of the seventeenth century. In the year 1609, the noble Walta family had a crypt built beneath the church for them to be buried in. Some members of the aforementioned Labadist community were also buried in the crypt. In the year 1765, construction crew accidentally rediscovered this crypt with its very well preserved bodies: the bodies were still wearing clothes, and they looked like they had just been buried.Official website of the mummy crypt So far, scientist have been unable to pinpoint the cause of the mummification of the bodies. Contributing factors such as the constant low temperature, high humidity and continuous airflow have been mentioned, but never proven.Official website of the mummy crypt The identity of the mummies is similarly unclear. The four mummies are one young girl (aged 14) that died around 1610 from tuberculosis, a woman that died a peaceful death around 1618, a man who died a painful death due to a dental abscess, and the gold smith Stellingwerf who appears to have died peacefully and was the last to be buried around the year 1705.Official website of the mummy crypt References External links Category:S√∫dwest-Frysl√¢n Category:Populated places in Friesland ","title":"Wiuwert"},{"id":"20125474","text":"Lobato (which means \\"wolfling\\" in Spanish and Portuguese) may refer to: People * Chano Lobato (1927‚Äì2009), Spanish flamenco singer * Cristian Lobato (born 1989), Spanish footballer * Edson Lobato, Brazilian scientist, 2006 World Food Prize recipient * Elvira Lobato, Brazilian journalist * Gilmar Lobato da Rocha (born 1973), Brazilian footballer * Josep Lobat√≥ (born 1977), Spanish Catalan radio and television presenter * Juan Jos√© Lobato (born 1988), Spanish cyclist *Kirstin Lobato, see Trials of Kirstin Lobato * L√∫cia Lobato (born 1965), East Timorese politician * Marcelo Lobato, member of Brazilian band O Rappa * Monteiro Lobato (1882‚Äì1948), Brazilian writer * Nelida Lobato (1934‚Äì1982), Argentinian dancer and actress * Nicolau dos Reis Lobato (1952‚Äì1978), East Timorese politician and national hero * Rita Lobato (1866‚Äì1954), first woman to practice medicine in Brazil * Rogerio Lobato (born 1949), East Timorese politician * Rosa Lobato de Faria (1932‚Äì2010), Portuguese actress and writer * Rub√©n Lobato (born 1978), Spanish cyclist * Tammy Lobato (born 1971), Australian politician Places * Lobato, Paran√°, a municipality in the state of Paran√°, Brazil * Mathias Lobato, a municipality in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil * Gon√ßalves Lobato Airport, in Viseu, Portugal * Monteiro Lobato, S√£o Paulo, a municipality in Brazil named after the writer * Presidente Nicolau Lobato International Airport, in East Timor, named after the politician * Lobatos, Colorado, a community in the United States See also * Lovato (disambiguation) ","title":"Lobato"},{"id":"20125479","text":"A classical molecular dynamics computer simulation of a collision cascade in Au induced by a 10 keV Au self-recoil. This is a typical case of a collision cascade in the heat spike regime. Each small sphere illustrates the position of an atom, in a 2-atom-layer-thick cross section of a three-dimensional simulation cell. The colors show (on a logarithmic scale) the kinetic energy of the atoms, with white and red being high kinetic energy from 10 keV downwards, and blue being low. A collision cascade (also known as a displacement cascade or a displacement spike) is a set of nearby adjacent energetic (much higher than ordinary thermal energies) collisions of atoms induced by an energetic particle in a solid or liquid. If the maximum atom or ion energies in a collision cascade are higher than the threshold displacement energy of the material (tens of eVs or more), the collisions can permanently displace atoms from their lattice sites and produce defects. The initial energetic atom can be, e.g., an ion from a particle accelerator, an atomic recoil produced by a passing high-energy neutron, electron or photon, or be produced when a radioactive nucleus decays and gives the atom a recoil energy. The nature of collision cascades can vary strongly depending on the energy and mass of the recoil/incoming ion and density of the material (stopping power). Linear cascades Schematic illustration of independent binary collisions between atoms When the initial recoil/ion mass is low, and the material where the cascade occurs has a low density (i.e. the recoil-material combination has a low stopping power), the collisions between the initial recoil and sample atoms occur rarely, and can be understood well as a sequence of independent binary collisions between atoms. This kind of a cascade can be theoretically well treated using the binary collision approximation (BCA) simulation approach. For instance, H and He ions with energies below 10 keV can be expected to lead to purely linear cascades in all materials. rightthumb Schematic illustration of a linear collision cascade. The thick line illustrates the position of the surface, and the thinner lines the ballistic movement paths of the atoms from beginning until they stop in the material. The purple circle is the incoming ion. Red, blue, green and yellow circles illustrate primary, secondary, tertiary and quaternary recoils, respectively. In between the ballistic collisions the ions move in a straight path. The most commonly used BCA code SRIMSRIM web site can be used to simulate linear collision cascades in disordered materials for all ion in all materials up to ion energies of 1 GeV. Note, however, that SRIM does not treat effects such as damage due to electronic energy deposition or damage produced by excited electrons. The nuclear and electronic stopping powers used are averaging fits to experiments, and are thus not perfectly accurate either. The electronic stopping power can be readily included in binary collision approximation or molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. In MD simulations they can be included either as a frictional force or in a more advanced manner by also following the heating of the electronic systems and coupling the electronic and atomic degrees of freedom. However, uncertainties remain on what is the appropriate low-energy limit of electronic stopping power or electron-phonon coupling is. In linear cascades the set of recoils produced in the sample can be described as a sequence of recoil generations depending on how many collision steps have passed since the original collision: primary knock-on atoms (PKA), secondary knock-on atoms (SKA), tertiary knock-on atoms (TKA), etc. Since it is extremely unlikely that all energy would be transferred to a knock-on atom, each generation of recoil atoms has on average less energy than the previous, and eventually the knock-on atom energies go below the threshold displacement energy for damage production, at which point no more damage can be produced. Heat spikes (thermal spikes) When the ion is heavy and energetic enough, and the material is dense, the collisions between the ions may occur so near to each other that they can not be considered independent of each other. In this case the process becomes a complicated process of many-body interactions between hundreds and tens of thousands of atoms, which can not be treated with the BCA, but can be modelled using molecular dynamics methods. As above, but in the middle the region of collisions has become so dense that multiple collisions occur simultaneously, which is called a heat spike. In this region the ions move in complex paths, and it is not possible to distinguish the numerical order of recoils - hence the atoms are colored with a mixture of red and blue. Typically, a heat spike is characterized by the formation of a transient underdense region in the center of the cascade, and an overdense region around it. After the cascade, the overdense region becomes interstitial defects, and the underdense region typically becomes a region of vacancies. If the kinetic energy of the atoms in the region of dense collisions is recalculated into temperature (using the basic equation E = 3/2¬∑N¬∑kBT), one finds that the kinetic energy in units of temperature is initially of the order of 10,000 K. Because of this, the region can be considered to be very hot, and is therefore called a heat spike or thermal spike (the two terms are usually considered to be equivalent). The heat spike cools down to the ambient temperature in 1‚Äì100 ps, so the \\"temperature\\" here does not correspond to thermodynamic equilibrium temperature. However, it has been shown that after about 3 lattice vibrations, the kinetic energy distribution of the atoms in a heat spike has the Maxwell‚ÄìBoltzmann distribution, making the use of the concept of temperature somewhat justified. Moreover, experiments have shown that a heat spike can induce a phase transition which is known to require a very high temperature, showing that the concept of a (non-equilibrium) temperature is indeed useful in describing collision cascades. In many cases, the same irradiation condition is a combination of linear cascades and heat spikes. For example, 10 MeV Cu ions bombarding Cu would initially move in the lattice in a linear cascade regime, since the nuclear stopping power is low. But once the Cu ion would slow down enough, the nuclear stopping power would increase and a heat spike would be produced. Moreover, many of the primary and secondary recoils of the incoming ions would likely have energies in the keV range and thus produce a heat spike. For instance, for copper irradiation of copper, recoil energies of around 5‚Äì20 keV are almost guaranteed to produce heat spikes. At lower energies, the cascade energy is too low to produce a liquid-like zone. At much higher energies, the Cu ions would most likely lead initially to a linear cascade, but the recoils could lead to heat spikes, as would the initial ion once it has slowed down enough. The concept subcascade breakdown threshold energy signifies the energy above which a recoil in a material is likely to produce several isolated heat spikes rather than a single dense one. Computer simulation-based animations of collision cascades in the heat spike regime are available on YouTube.\\"displacement cascade\\" Search, YouTube.com =Swift heavy ion thermal spikes= Swift heavy ions, i.e. MeV and GeV heavy ions which produce damage by a very strong electronic stopping, can also be considered to produce thermal spikes in the sense that they lead to strong lattice heating and a transient disordered atom zone. However, at least the initial stage of the damage might be better understood in terms of a Coulomb explosion mechanism. Regardless of what the heating mechanism is, it is well established that swift heavy ions in insulators typically produce ion tracks forming long cylindrical damage zones of reduced density. Time scale To understand the nature of collision cascade, it is very important to know the associated time scale. The ballistic phase of the cascade, when the initial ion/recoil and its primary and lower-order recoils have energies well above the threshold displacement energy, typically lasts 0.1‚Äì0.5 ps. If a heat spike is formed, it can live for some 1‚Äì100 ps until the spike temperature has cooled down essentially to the ambient temperature. The cooling down of the cascade occurs via lattice heat conductivity and by electronic heat conductivity after the hot ionic subsystem has heated up the electronic one via electron‚Äìphonon coupling. Unfortunately the rate of electron-phonon coupling from the hot and disordered ionic system is not well known, as it can not be treated equally to the fairly well known process of transfer of heat from hot electrons to an intact crystal structure. Finally, the relaxation phase of the cascade, when the defects formed possibly recombine and migrate, can last from a few ps to infinite times, depending on the material, its defect migration and recombination properties, and the ambient temperature. Effects channeling conditions. The image is produced by a classical molecular dynamics simulation of a collision cascade. The image shows a cross section of two atomic layers in the middle of a threedimensional simulation cell. Each sphere illustrates the position of an atom, and the colors show the kinetic energy of each atom as indicated by the scale on the right. At the end, both point defects and dislocation loops remain. =Damage production= Since the kinetic energies in a cascade can be very high, it can drive the material locally far outside thermodynamic equilibrium. Typically this results in defect production. The defects can be, e.g., point defects such as Frenkel pairs, ordered or disordered dislocation loops, stacking faults, or amorphous zones. Prolonged irradiation of many materials can lead to their full amorphization, an effect which occurs regularly during the ion implantation doping of silicon chips. The defects production can be harmful, such as in nuclear fission and fusion reactors where the neutrons slowly degrade the mechanical properties of the materials, or a useful and desired materials modification effect, e.g., when ions are introduced into semiconductor quantum well structures to speed up the operation of a laser. or to strengthen carbon nanotubes. A curious feature of collision cascades is that the final amount of damage produced may be much less than the number of atoms initially affected by the heat spikes. Especially in pure metals, the final damage production after the heat spike phase can be orders of magnitude smaller than the number of atoms displaced in the spike. On the other hand, in semiconductors and other covalently bonded materials the damage production is usually similar to the number of displaced atoms. Ionic materials can behave like either metals or semiconductors with respect to the fraction of damage recombined. =Other consequences= Collision cascades in the vicinity of a surface often lead to sputtering, both in the linear spike and heat spike regimes. Heat spikes near surfaces also frequently lead to crater formation. This cratering is caused by liquid flow of atoms, but if the projectile size above roughly 100,000 atoms, the crater production mechanism switches to the same mechanism as that of macroscopic craters produced by bullets or asteroids. The fact that many atoms are displaced by a cascade means that ions can be used to deliberately mix materials, even for materials that are normally thermodynamically immiscible. This effect is known as ion beam mixing. The non-equilibrium nature of irradiation can also be used to drive materials out of thermodynamic equilibrium, and thus form new kinds of alloys.

As a child, he was exposed to various forms of art such as shadow puppet performances and sacred dances at the village's temples. He learned to make shadow puppets from his grandfather. This became the basis for his skillful depiction of the Ramayana and Mahabharata in his early paintings. =Influence of Walter Spies= Sobrat and his neighbor Anak Agung Gde Meregeg were the first two artists in Padangtegal to meet Walter Spies, at the end of the 1920s.Hans Rhodius and John Darling, Walter Spies and Balinese Art, Terra (1980) Spies was a German artist who together with Rudolf Bonnet was thought to be the agent of change for the modernization of Balinese art. Sobrat worked and lived with Spies for a year. Spies' influence can be seen in his early works, particularly those with split or double horizons. He learned western style painting from Spies and Rudolf Bonnet. In the early 1930s, Bonnet considered him to be the most talented Balinese artist of the period for his drawing skill, color composition and his versatility. It is from Bonnet that he learned portraiture. From 1957 and 1959 Sobrat taught at the Academy of Fine Arts in Yogyakarta.

Approximately 4700 of the nearly 100,000 military bikes made by Norton during WW2 were Big 4 sidecar outfits. Designed to carry two or three men plus their fighting equipment over very rough terrain, the Big 4 was used for reconnaissance and carrying loads of ammunition to the front line troops.

Early life and university Klier was born in 1944 in Bellefonte, Pennsylvania, USA, and his family lived briefly in Washington before settling in Syracuse, New York. His father taught aeronautical engineering at Syracuse University. Brought up as a Catholic, John attended Notre Dame University in South Bend, Indiana for his BA and MA in history. He pursued doctoral study at the University of Illinois, which was known for Russian and Soviet history. In his investigations of pre- revolutionary Russia, he noticed that little research had been conducted on Russian Jewry for most of the 20th century. His PhD dissertation examined the process by which the Russian Empire, after the partitions of Poland in the late 18th century, absorbed Jews into the Russian state system. His first book, Russia Gathers Her Jews: The Origins of the Jewish Question in Russia (1986), expanded on the PhD thesis.Anthony Polonsky, \\"Professor John Klier\\", The Independent, September 23, 2007, accessed 29 June 2017.

History In 1951 the US Army Chemical Corps and Ordnance Corps initiated a joint program to develop a 115mm chemical rocket. The US Army Ordnance Corps designed the 115mm T238 and launcher in 1957 to provide the army a means to attack large area targets with chemical agents. Artillery and mortars are for small area targets; and due to different spin stabilities, warheads intended for explosives are not ideal for chemical delivery. The 115mm rocket was subsequently accepted as the M55 rocket with M91 launcher. Produced from 1959‚Äì1965, the M55s were manufactured at Newport Army Ammunition Plant and tested at Aberdeen Proving Ground.

S. Mineral Land Agency 1843, Copper Harbor, Michigan, Lake Superior (New York: Vantage Press, 1966) He returned to the new state of Texas during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. Following the war, he served as chief surveyor of the US‚ÄìMexican commission which established the border after the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. When the U. S. Commissioner, John Bartlett, a Yankee, gave away the Rio Grande's Mesilla Valley because of a map error, which had been disputed by the Mexican Delegation, the fiery Southerner Gray opposed the unacceptable compromise, and was removed from the commission (as surveyor, his signature was required for approval of the compromise). He was replaced by friend William Emory, but not before Gray had finished surveying the original U.S.‚ÄìMexico boundary from the Rio Grande, over the Black Range, down the Gila River to its junction with the Colorado River, and across the desert of southern California to the Pacific Ocean at San Diego. The U.S. Congress reviewing the case sided with Gray, but in the interim the President had sent James Gadsden to Mexico City to buy not just the Mesilla Valley of New Mexico but what is now known as the Gadsden Purchase from Mexico. Gray's claim in his survey report that it was the best route for a railroad influenced the Senate to approve the Treaty in 1854.\\"Gray, Andrew Belcher\\" in Encyclopedia of Frontier Biography: G-O, by Dan L. Thrapp. University of Nebraska Press, 1991. William S. Kiser, Turmoil on the Rio Grande, the Territorial History of the Mesilla Valley, 1846-1865 (College Station: Texas A & M University, 2011) Earlier, in 1849, he had accompanied the boundary commission to San Diego. The town of San Diego was then located at the foot of Presidio Hill, more than a mile from navigable water. When Gray's party camped near what is now H Street in Downtown San Diego, he realized that a location near San Diego Bay would make a much better site for a city. He proposed the idea to several San Diegans and found a receptive audience in William Heath Davis. Davis recruited several other investors and founded New Town San Diego.\\"Abortive Attempt to Establish New San Diego\\", Smythe's History of San Diego part 2, chapter 14 Gray was a partner in the project and built a cottage in the area.\\"Dream of Glory (William Heath Davis)\\", The Journal of San Diego History 13:2 (1967) New Town was unsuccessful due to a financial depression in 1851, a lack of fresh water, and hostility from the original settlers in Old Town and La Playa. An army facility was maintained in the area throughout the 1850s but was then abandoned. However, Gray's idea was successfully revived by Alonzo Horton in 1867, and by 1880 the main focus of the city of San Diego moved to the waterfront area identified by Gray, where it remains to this day. In 1852 he was recruited by the Texas Western Railroad to lead a survey from San Antonio westwards towards the Colorado River and California; his journals were published in 1856 as Survey of a Route for the Southern Pacific R.R. on the 32nd Parallel. In 1857, he was back in Arizona promoting copper mines, at Ajo and the future Ray-Hayden-Winkelman area, Arizona. Because of transportation costs and Apache attacks, the mines were only begun to be opened before war clouds loomed (in the twentieth century the Ray and Ajo open pits were among the largest copper producers in the country).L.

Brady who Accompanied the Expedition (Los Angeles: Westernlore Press, 1963) He had settled in Tucson, Arizona, continued his surveying business, before joining the Confederate States Army on the outbreak of the American Civil War. He worked as an engineer on fortifications along the Mississippi River, and was killed in 1862 when the boiler of a steamboat he was traveling on exploded. He left a wife and three daughters in New Orleans to mourn his loss.

The Braves had acquired Kraft from the Brooklyn Robins, and returned Kraft to them in July. Brooklyn tried to send Kraft to the minor leagues, but Kraft sought the protection of the newly formed Fraternity of Professional Baseball Players of America, which under the terms of a new agreement with the Major League teams would allow Kraft to tender his services to higher-classed minor league teams. Under this clause, Kraft signed with the Class AA Newark Indians. However, the National Commission ruled that the rule could not be applied retroactively, and that Kraft's rights belonged to the Class A Nashville Volunteers. Kraft refused to report to the Volunteers, however, and the dispute was only settled when Robins owner Charles Ebbets paid Nashville $2,500 to rescind their claim on Kraft.Minor League Baseball Top 100 Teams: #4, 1924 Fort Worth Panthers Later, playing for the Fort Worth Panthers, Kraft led the Texas League in home runs three straight times, from through .

He was admitted into the bar and practiced in New York. In 1858, Lee moved to Kansas. When he arrived he became one of the founders of the Elwood Free Press. In 1859, he was elected a district judge, and when the American Civil War began Lee was serving as a justice of the Kansas Supreme Court. Civil War and later life At the outbreak of the Civil War, Lee joined the Union Army. Lee became a major in the 7th Kansas Cavalry, in October 1861. He was promoted to colonel of the regiment and took part in Henry W. Halleck's capture of Corinth, Mississippi. Shortly after the fall of that city, Lee commanded the 2nd Brigade in the Cavalry Division of the Army of the Mississippi and participated in the battle of Corinth. On November 29, 1862, he received a promotion to brigadier general in the Volunteer Army. He continued leading cavalry brigades in the Army of the Tennessee before he was appointed Chief-of-Staff to the XIII Corps under Maj. Gen. John A. McClernand. Lee served as chief-of-staff through much of the Vicksburg campaign, serving at the battles of Port Gibson, Champion Hill and Big Black River. During the fighting at the Big Black River, Peter J. Osterhaus was wounded and Lee was chosen to take his place in command of the 9th Division, XIII Corps.

During the assault Lee was wounded in the head and turned over command of the brigade. He sat out the rest of the siege recovering from wounds until late in the summer when he returned to division command in the XIII Corps. In August 1864 he was placed in command of the Cavalry Division of the Department of the Gulf. He led the cavalry forces during Nathaniel P. Banks' Red River Campaign.

Works Marianne Csakyhttp://artportal.hu/lexikon/muveszek/csaky_marianne_csaky_m_caliban works with various media: photo, painting, sculpture, embroidery, video and installation. In her juvenile works she exclusively used leather for her sculptures and 3D objects. In her early works - sculptures made out of pieces of waste wood and plaster - language, desire, subjectivity and the androgynous nature of soul and mind were in the focus of her interest (Aphrodite Urania, 1995, Feast,Andr√°s, Edit. M≈±csarnok, Budapest/Palace of Art, Budapest. In Eur√≥pa: Kre√°ci√≥ & Re-kre√°ci√≥. Ki√°ll√≠t√°si katal√≥gus./Europe: Creation & Re- creation. Exhibition catalogue. Budapest, M≈±csarnok/Palace of Art, 1995, p. 45. 1990). In this period of her career she was influenced by the works of ancient Greek philosophers, first of all Plato's Symposium. In these works she started to use the love scene, a depiction of sexual intercourse as a visual metaphor or rather metonymy of human subjectivity and the language of desire (Aphrodite Urania, Hands and Soles,Andr√°s, Edit. A test reprezent√°ci√≥ja a kort√°rs magyar k√©pz≈ëm≈±v√©szetben/The representation of the body in contemporary Hungarian art. In: Erotika √©s szexualit√°s a magyar k√©pz≈ëm≈±v√©szetben/ Erotica and sexuality in Hungarian art. Budapest, Liga, 1999. 1995, Slanting Space, 1997). Cs√°ky has also created complex spatial constructions which modelled the shifting, alterable and unstable nature of our views, beliefs, judgements and first of all the unstable nature of our identity (Slanting Space). For instance, in 1997, she built a new slanting floor in Gallery 56, thereby using bodily instabilization for intellectual deconstruction. Chopping boards with carvings of scenes of sexual intercourse hung from the ceiling of the gallery, swinging and turning gently with the slightest movements of the air. From 2000, her interest turned toward personal and small community history. These series of works (My Skins 2005, Time Leap 2007-8) are the appropriation of her family past, an experiment with the nature of memory and post memory work. In My Skins, a series of leather curtains and leather wall carpets with embossing and pencil drawing, she used swine leather again, referring to childhood memory. After the 56 revolution in Hungary Cs√°ky's grandfather was compelled to live in a self-maintaining farm where he also produced animal hides.http://hvg.hu/kultura/20081027_csaky_marianne_interju_kortars_muveszet/page2.aspx The pencil drawings on the leather are based on old family photographs from the artist‚Äôs childhood. The Time Leap series (Light Boxes, 2007-8, Stitched Photos, 2008Cathy Rose A. Garcia. Foreign Artists Share Insights on Life, Seoul Korea Times, 04.04.2008. See also https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/art/2008/04/135_21967.html) represent a complex construction of different layers of time and subjectivity. It is the documentation of the artist‚Äôs efforts to displace records, deconstruct documents preserving personal memories, to rewrite the past, and, by doing so, change the present. In the case of Light Boxes the artist took colour shots of herself, and from the colour negatives she inserted her figure into old black- and-white negatives depicting her as a child. As a result, she appears twice in each of these negatives, in two different ages, then and now. She constructed an installation for these film negatives by making a wire frame and placing a mirror behind each negative at a 45-degree angle. This mirror reflects the light from a light-bulb fixed to the wall above the frame, and illuminates the scenes from behind, making the negative images visible. The second group of works in the Time Leap series (Stitched Photos ‚Äì Video Stills, 2008) are images depicting a lonely female figure (the artist) in a solitary state of sexual desire, situated in positions of love acts without the object of this desire appearing in the images. This is again an intervention in the past ‚Äì or rather, an intervention of the past in the present. The still images are taken from video recordings taken by the artist, while the silk figures sewn on the images are from the same series of old family photos as the ones appearing in the light boxes. While the light boxes rewrite the past by placing the artist‚Äôs present self in those images, in this series the opposite occurs: figures from family history appear in her present. Madonna (2008) and Queen (2008) in Time Leap ‚Äì Stitched Photos series also based on old negatives from the family collection depicting prearranged dressed up scenes. The ‚Äúas if‚Äù perspective of family photos is also in the focus of Csaky‚Äôs interest, the way people's actions and people themselves are arranged, made to pose and the way they use the images of the nature. She claims that family photos, in this sense, are depictions, explicit manifestations of desires for things that are not there or are not the way they should be. However artificial the image of the desires and feelings appearing in family photos might be, it is, in fact, real.M√©lyi, J√≥zsef.

Khaled was the older brother of Hani al-Hassan. Early life Al-Hassan was born in Haifa in 1928. He and his family lived there until they were exiled as refugees after Israel's capture of the city in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, which he participated in on the side of Palestinian Arab forces. His family settled in Sidon, Lebanon, but he left for Egypt. He was briefly detained in Egypt \\"just for being Palestinian\\" according to him. After being released, he reunited with his family in Lebanon where he lived briefly.Cobban, 1984, pp.22-23. In 1949 he formed the short- lasing commando group Tahrir Filastin. A year later he moved to Syria. During this time, al-Hassan worked as a teacher in Damascus and he helped found the Islamic Liberation Party in 1952. Syrian authorities threatened to arrest him that year for attempting to set up another Palestinian commando group, but he left to Kuwait. There, he worked as a civil servant, typist, and later as Secretary-General of the Municipal Council Board in the country until 1967. He was awarded Kuwaiti citizenship in the mid-1950s.Palestinian Personalities Palestinian Academic Society for the Study of International Affairs (PASSIA). Fatah and PLO activism Al-Hassan was one of the original founders of Fatah and in Kuwait, he managed to establish a network of Palestinian activists. In 1962, al-Hassan, Yasser Arafat, Khalil al-Wazir and Salah Khalaf established a magazine called Filastuna, Nida' al-Hayat (\\"Palestine, Our Call to Life\\"). According to al-Hassan, the \\"Kuwaiti Fatah group\\" was known before the Fatah groups in Europe, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Gaza and Iraq because of the magazine which was based in Tripoli, Lebanon. Fatah had formed a Central Committee which became the main body of the movement and of the ten members, Hassan was one of them.Cobban, 1984, pp.24-25. In 1968, al-Hassan was elected to the Palestine Liberation Organization Executive Committee (PLO-EC) after Fatah took control of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) in 1968. Early that year, al-Hassan persuaded Saudi King Faisal to enforce the \\"liberation tax\\" which required Palestinians in that country to pay a percentage of their income to the PLO. This, in turn, supplied the PLO with 60 million riyal yearly. Also, in that year, he spoke to the Egyptian Foreign Minister Mahmoud Riyad and Mohammad Hassanein Heykal on behalf of Gamal Abdel Nasser in order to familiarize him with Fatah and its armed branch al-Assifa.Cobban, 1984, p.45. From 1973, until his death, al-Hassan was chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee of the Palestinian National Council and was thus considered the first \\"foreign minister of the PLO\\". After the Yom Kippur War in 1973, he argued that the \\"Palestinian struggle\\" could continue with a state in the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel and he wrote up an unofficial five-point proposal in April‚ÄìMay 1980, advocating Israel‚Äôs withdrawal from the territories, the deployment of United Nations forces, and work on arrangements for the creation of a Palestinian state in the territories. Later life and death Mahmoud Rabbani and Khaled al-Hassan (1980) Al-Hassan called election of a Palestinian provisional government capable of ending the PLO‚Äôs isolation after the First Intifada in 1991. He settled in Rabat, Morocco that year after being expelled, along with hundreds of thousands of other Palestinians, from Kuwait during the Gulf War, in which the PLO aligned itself with Saddam Hussein's Iraq. Al-Hassan authored Grasping the Nettle of Peace in 1992, advocating a Swiss-style confederation in which citizens from Israel, the Palestinian territories and Jordan would vote according to their canton, hence no recognition of the Arab land captured by Israel in 1948. He opposed the way Arafat and PLO officials handled the Oslo Agreements. Al-Hassan suffered from cancer since 1991 and died from it on October 8, 1994 at the age of 66.Khaled al-Hassan, P.L.O.

After being backup in his first season, spent in Segunda Divisi√≥n, and serving a loan in Mexico with C.F. Pachuca (being part of the squad that won the Invierno 1999 tournament), he became the starter, scoring four goals in the 2001‚Äì02 campaign but with the Canary Islands team being relegated from La Liga, with the keeper finding the net through penalties. In 2003, Gonz√°lez returned to Argentina where he played for Estudiantes de La Plata and Club Atl√©tico Nueva Chicago also in the top flight. Two years later he was part of the Uni√≥n Espa√±ola team that won the Chilean Apertura in 2005 and, the following season, played six matches with local side Arsenal de Sarand√≠. During a 2005 match for Uni√≥n Espa√±ola against Uni√≥n San Felipe, Gonz√°lez received his second yellow card and was consequently ejected by Enrique Osses.

It is not certain what the Tappan called themselves, but there are a variety of interpretations for the word. One suggestion is that it possibly comes from tuphanne meaning cold water.Old Tappan is the name given to the region and its inhabitants by New Netherlanders from the 1687 patent: \\"‚Ä¶a Cartaine trackt of Landt named ould tappan as ye same is bounded by trees marked by ye indians.\\" Tappan, from the Lenni Lenape word Tuphanne (reputed to mean cold water) It related to contemporary petapan meaning dawn or petapaniui meaning at the break of dawn, and relates to their kin across the river, the Wappinger, whose name is derived from the Algonquian people of the east or easterners. (Contemporary: Wapaneu meaning easterly and Wapanke meaning tomorrow.) Vriessendael, one of the first \\"bouweries\\", or homesteads, built in the territory was sometimes called Tappan. The Tappan are recalled throughout their former territory: Lake Tappan is a reservoir on the Hackensack River; the Tappan Zee, widening of the Hudson River and the bridge crossing it; Old Tappan in Bergen County; Tappan in Rockland County. History The Tappan migrated seasonally and engaged in companion planting, hunting, fishing, and trapping. Like the other natives who circulated in the region and whose territory overlapped, the Hackensack, Acquackanonk and Rumachenanck (later called the Haverstraw). The Tappan were of the Turtle Clan and spoke the Unami dialect of Lenape. The Tappan and the Hackensack actually were but one tribe and members of it were called either by one name or another according to their dwelling place.Indian Deeds 1630 - 1748; Budke, George H.; Library Association of Rockland County, 1975, pg 18 They, as well as the Raritan, Wappinger, Manhattan (also known as \\"Manhattoe\\"), were collectively known as the River Indians. Those groups living in the adjoining highlands to the west and north have become known as the Munsee.Indian Tribes of Hudson's River; Ruttenber, E.M.; Hope Farm Press, 3rd ed, 2001, Palisades, part of Tappan territory Contact with the European settlers was at first as trading partners. It is from them that David de Vries purchased the land (1640) to build the homestead at Vriessendael (Edgewater) and, who living among them, became an advocate of learning more about indigenous culture. It was an early Director of New Netherland, William Kieft, who attempted to exact tribute from them (but was ignored), and later allowed a number of them to be slaughtered after they had sought safety at Pavonia (1643), beginning a Kieft's War.

Academic background  He studied at the Universities of Leipzig and Bonn, where at the latter he was a student of Hermann Usener (1834-1905), who in 1899 became Dieterich's father-in-law. In 1888 he earned his doctorate, and three years later received his habilitation in Marburg with a dissertation on Orphism. Afterwards he traveled to Italy and Greece for research purposes. His grave in Heidelberg In 1895 he returned to Marburg as an associate professor, and two years later succeeded Eduard Schwartz (1858-1940) as chair of classical philology at the University of Giessen. In 1903 he was a full professor at the University of Heidelberg.  Works  Much of Dieterich's work involved research of traditional beliefs, mythology and religion of the Greco-Roman world. He was the author of an influential work titled \\"Abraxas: Studien zur Religionsgeschichte des sp√§tern Altertums\\", a study based on a magical papyri that was housed at the Leyden Museum. In 1903 he published \\"Eine Mithrasliturgie\\", in which he proposes that lines 475 ‚Äì 834 of the Paris Magical Papyrus contained the official liturgy of the Mithras Cult.

In quantum optics, an optical phase space is a phase space in which all quantum states of an optical system are described. Each point in the optical phase space corresponds to a unique state of an optical system. For any such system, a plot of the quadratures against each other, possibly as functions of time, is called a phase diagram. If the quadratures are functions of time then the optical phase diagram can show the evolution of a quantum optical system with time. An optical phase diagram can give insight into the properties and behaviors of the system that might otherwise not be obvious. This can allude to qualities of the system that can be of interest to an individual studying an optical system that would be very hard to deduce otherwise. Another use for an optical phase diagram is that it shows the evolution of the state of an optical system. This can be used to determine the state of the optical system at any point in time. Background information When discussing the quantum theory of light, it is very common to use an electromagnetic oscillator as a model. An electromagnetic oscillator describes an oscillation of the electric field. Since the magnetic field is proportional to the rate of change of the electric field, this too oscillates. Such oscillations describe light. Systems composed of such oscillators can be described by an optical phase space. Let u(x,t) be a vector function describing a single mode of an electromagnetic oscillator. For simplicity, it is assumed that this electromagnetic oscillator is in vacuum. An example is the plane wave given by : \\\\mathbf{u}(\\\\mathbf{x},t) = \\\\mathbf{u_{0}}e^{i(\\\\mathbf{k} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{x} - \\\\omega t)} where u0 is the polarization vector, k is the wave vector, \\\\omega the frequency, and A\\\\cdot B denotes the dot product between the vectors A and B. This is the equation for a plane wave and is a simple example of such an electromagnetic oscillator. The oscillators being examined could either be free waves in space or some normal mode contained in some cavity. A single mode of the electromagnetic oscillator is isolated from the rest of the system and examined. Such an oscillator, when quantized, is described by the mathematics of a quantum harmonic oscillator. Quantum oscillators are described using creation and annihilation operators \\\\hat a^\\\\dagger and \\\\hat a. Physical quantities, such as the electric field strength, then become quantum operators. In order to distinguish a physical quantity from the quantum mechanical operator used to describe it, a \\"hat\\" is used over the operator symbols. Thus, for example, where E_i might represent (one component of) the electric field, the symbol \\\\widehat E_i denotes the quantum-mechanical operator that describes E_i. This convention is used throughout this article, but is not in common use in more advanced texts, which avoid the hat, as it simply clutters the text. In the quantum oscillator mode, most operators representing physical quantities are typically expressed in terms of the creation and annihilation operators. In this example, the electric field strength is given by: :\\\\widehat{E}_{i}=u_{i}^{*}(\\\\mathbf{x},t)\\\\widehat{a}^{\\\\dagger} + u_{i}(\\\\mathbf{x},t)\\\\widehat{a} (where xi is a single component of x, position). The Hamiltonian for an electromagnetic oscillator is found by quantizing the electromagnetic field for this oscillator and the formula is given by: :\\\\widehat{H} = \\\\hbar\\\\omega (\\\\widehat{a}^{\\\\dagger}\\\\widehat{a} + 1/2) where \\\\omega is the frequency of the (spatio-temporal) mode. The annihilation operator is the bosonic annihilation operator and so it obeys the canonical commutation relation given by: :[\\\\widehat{a},\\\\widehat{a}^{\\\\dagger}] = 1 The eigenstates of the annihilation operator are called coherent states: :\\\\widehat{a}\\\\alpha\\\\rangle = \\\\alpha\\\\alpha\\\\rangle It is important to note that the annihilation operator is not Hermitian; therefore its eigenvalues \\\\alpha can be complex. This has important consequences. Finally, the photon number is given by the operator \\\\widehat{N} = \\\\widehat{a}^{\\\\dagger} \\\\widehat{a}, which gives the number of photons in the given (spatial-temporal) mode u. Quadratures Operators given by : \\\\widehat q = \\\\tfrac 1 {2}(\\\\widehat a^\\\\dagger + \\\\widehat a) and : \\\\widehat p = \\\\tfrac i {2}(\\\\widehat a^\\\\dagger - \\\\widehat a) are called the quadratures and they represent the real and imaginary parts of the complex amplitude represented by \\\\widehat a. The commutation relation between the two quadratures can easily be calculated: : \\\\begin{align} \\\\left[ \\\\widehat q, \\\\widehat p \\\\right] &= \\\\tfrac i 4 [\\\\widehat a^\\\\dagger + \\\\widehat a, \\\\widehat a^\\\\dagger - \\\\widehat a] \\\\ &= \\\\tfrac i 4 ([\\\\widehat a^\\\\dagger, \\\\widehat a^\\\\dagger] - [\\\\widehat a^\\\\dagger, \\\\widehat a] + [\\\\widehat a, \\\\widehat a^\\\\dagger] - [\\\\widehat a, \\\\widehat a]) \\\\ &= \\\\tfrac i 4 (-(-1) + 1) \\\\ &= \\\\tfrac i 2 \\\\end{align} This looks very similar to the commutation relation of the position and momentum operator. Thus, it can be useful to think of and treat the quadratures as the position and momentum of the oscillator although in fact they are the \\"in-phase and out-of-phase components of the electric field amplitude of the spatial-temporal mode\\", or u, and have nothing really to do with the position or momentum of the electromagnetic oscillator (as it is hard to define what is meant by position and momentum for an electromagnetic oscillator). =Properties of quadratures= The eigenstates of the quadrature operators \\\\widehat{q} and \\\\widehat{p} are called the quadrature states. They satisfy the relations: :* \\\\widehat{q}q\\\\rangle = q q\\\\rangle and \\\\widehat{p}p\\\\rangle = p p\\\\rangle :* \\\\langle q  q'\\\\rangle = \\\\delta(q-q') and \\\\langle p  p'\\\\rangle = \\\\delta(p-p') :* \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} q\\\\rangle \\\\langle q\\\\, dq = 1 and \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} p\\\\rangle \\\\langle p\\\\, dp = 1 as these form complete basis sets. =Important result= The following is an important relation that can be derived from the above which justifies our interpretation that the quadratures are the real and imaginary parts of a complex \\\\alpha (i.e. the in- phase and out-of-phase components of the electromagnetic oscillator) : \\\\langle\\\\alpha\\\\widehat{q}\\\\alpha\\\\rangle = 2^{-1/2}(\\\\langle\\\\alpha\\\\widehat{a}^{\\\\dagger}\\\\alpha\\\\rangle + \\\\langle\\\\alpha\\\\widehat{a}\\\\alpha\\\\rangle) = 2^{-1/2}(\\\\alpha^{*}\\\\langle\\\\alpha\\\\alpha\\\\rangle + \\\\alpha\\\\langle\\\\alpha\\\\alpha\\\\rangle) The following is a relationship that can be used to help evaluate the above and is given by: :\\\\langle\\\\alpha'\\\\alpha\\\\rangle = e^{(-1/2)(\\\\alpha'^{2}+\\\\alpha^{2}) + \\\\alpha'^{*}\\\\alpha} This gives us that: : \\\\langle\\\\alpha\\\\widehat{q}\\\\alpha\\\\rangle = 2^{-1/2}(\\\\alpha^{*} + \\\\alpha) = q_{\\\\alpha} : \\\\langle\\\\alpha\\\\widehat{p}\\\\alpha\\\\rangle = i2^{-1/2}(\\\\alpha^{*} - \\\\alpha) = p_{\\\\alpha} by a similar method as above. : \\\\alpha = 2^{-1/2}(\\\\langle\\\\alpha\\\\widehat{q}\\\\alpha\\\\rangle + i\\\\langle\\\\alpha\\\\widehat{p}\\\\alpha\\\\rangle) = 2^{-1/2}(q_{\\\\alpha} + ip_{\\\\alpha}) Thus, \\\\alpha is just a composition of the quadratures. Another very important property of the coherent states becomes very apparent in this formalism. A coherent state is not a point in the optical phase space but rather a distribution on it. This can be seen via :q_{\\\\alpha} = \\\\langle\\\\alpha\\\\widehat{q}\\\\alpha\\\\rangle and :p_{\\\\alpha} = \\\\langle\\\\alpha\\\\widehat{p}\\\\alpha\\\\rangle. These are only the expectation values of \\\\widehat{q} and \\\\widehat{p} for the state \\\\alpha\\\\rangle. It can be shown that the quadratures obey Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle given by: :\\\\Delta q\\\\Delta p \\\\ge 1/2 (where \\\\Delta q and \\\\Delta p are the variances of the distributions of q and p, respectively) This inequality does not necessarily have to be saturated and a common example of such states are squeezed coherent states. The coherent states are Gaussian probability distributions over the phase space localized around \\\\alpha. Operators on phase space It is possible to define operators to move the coherent states around the phase space. These can produce new coherent states and allow us to move around phase space. =Phase-shifting operator= Phase shifting operator acting on a coherent state rotating it by an angle \\\\theta in phase space. The phase- shifting operator rotates the coherent state by an angle \\\\theta in the optical phase space. This operator is given by: : \\\\widehat{U}(\\\\theta) = e^{-i\\\\theta\\\\widehat{N}} The important relationship : \\\\widehat{U}(\\\\theta)^{\\\\dagger}\\\\widehat{a}\\\\widehat{U}(\\\\theta) = \\\\widehat{a}e^{-i\\\\theta} is derived as follows: : d/d\\\\theta (\\\\widehat{U}^{\\\\dagger}\\\\widehat{a}\\\\widehat{U}) = i\\\\widehat{N}\\\\widehat{U}^{\\\\dagger}\\\\widehat{a}\\\\widehat{U} - i\\\\widehat{U}^{\\\\dagger}\\\\widehat{a}\\\\widehat{U}\\\\widehat{N} = \\\\widehat{U}^{\\\\dagger}i[\\\\widehat{N},\\\\widehat{a}]\\\\widehat{U} := \\\\widehat{U}^{\\\\dagger}i(\\\\widehat{a}^{\\\\dagger}\\\\widehat{a}\\\\widehat{a} - \\\\widehat{a}\\\\widehat{a}^{\\\\dagger}\\\\widehat{a})\\\\widehat{U} = \\\\widehat{U}^{\\\\dagger}i[\\\\widehat{a}^{\\\\dagger},\\\\widehat{a}]\\\\widehat{a}\\\\widehat{U} = -i\\\\widehat{U}^{\\\\dagger}\\\\widehat{a}\\\\widehat{U} and solving this differential equation yields the desired result. Thus, using the above it becomes clear that :\\\\widehat{U}(\\\\theta)\\\\alpha\\\\rangle = \\\\alpha e^{-i\\\\theta}\\\\rangle, or a rotation by an angle theta on the coherent state in phase space. The following illustrates this more clearly: :\\\\widehat{a}(\\\\widehat{U}\\\\alpha\\\\rangle) = \\\\widehat{U}\\\\widehat{a}e^{-i\\\\theta}\\\\alpha\\\\rangle (which is obtained using the fact that the phase-shifting operator is unitary : \\\\widehat{a}(\\\\widehat{U}\\\\alpha\\\\rangle) = \\\\widehat{U} \\\\alpha e^{-i\\\\theta}\\\\alpha\\\\rangle = \\\\alpha e^{-i\\\\theta}(\\\\widehat{U}\\\\alpha\\\\rangle) Thus, :(\\\\alpha e^{-i\\\\theta}, \\\\widehat{U}\\\\alpha\\\\rangle) is the eigenpair of : \\\\widehat{a}\\\\widehat{U}\\\\alpha\\\\rangle. From this it is possible to see that : (\\\\alpha e^{-i\\\\theta} = 2^{-1/2}[q_{\\\\alpha} \\\\cos(\\\\theta) + p_{\\\\alpha} \\\\sin(\\\\theta)] + i2^{-1/2}[-q_{\\\\alpha} \\\\sin(\\\\theta) + p_{\\\\alpha} \\\\cos(\\\\theta)], \\\\widehat{U}\\\\alpha\\\\rangle = \\\\alpha e^{-i\\\\theta}\\\\rangle) which is another way of expressing the eigenpair which more clearly illustrates the effects of the phase-shifting operator on coherent states. =Displacement operator= Displacement operator acting on a coherent state displacing it by some value \\\\alpha in phase space. The displacement operator is a unitary operator that takes a coherent state and turns it into another unitary state. The displacement operator is given by :\\\\widehat{D}(\\\\alpha) = e^{\\\\alpha\\\\widehat{a}^{\\\\dagger} - \\\\alpha^{*}\\\\widehat{a}} and its name comes from an important relation : \\\\widehat{a}(\\\\alpha) \\\\equiv \\\\widehat{D}^{\\\\dagger}(\\\\alpha)\\\\widehat{a}\\\\widehat{D}(\\\\alpha) = \\\\widehat{a} + \\\\alpha. Indeed, let's temporarily introduce \\\\widehat{a}(s) = \\\\widehat{a}(s \\\\alpha) with real s and consider how \\\\widehat{a}(s) varies when s changes from 0 to 1. Differentiating \\\\widehat{a}(s) with respect to s, we find \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial s} \\\\widehat{a}(s) = D^\\\\dagger(s \\\\alpha) [\\\\alpha^* \\\\widehat{a} - \\\\alpha \\\\widehat{a}^\\\\dagger, \\\\widehat{a} ] D(s\\\\alpha) = \\\\alpha, so that \\\\widehat{a}(s) = \\\\widehat{a}(0) + s \\\\alpha. Since coherent states are eigenstates of both the annihilation operator and the operator of multiplication by a number, it is easy to see that, indeed, the displacement operator moves the coherent states, or, more precisely, \\\\widehat{D}(\\\\alpha)  \\\\beta \\\\rangle =  \\\\alpha + \\\\beta \\\\rangle. Indeed, the relation derived above can be rewritten as \\\\widehat{a} \\\\widehat{D}(\\\\alpha) = \\\\widehat{D}(\\\\alpha) (\\\\widehat{a} + \\\\alpha), then \\\\widehat{a} \\\\widehat{D}(\\\\alpha)  \\\\beta \\\\rangle = \\\\widehat{D}(\\\\alpha) (\\\\widehat{a} + \\\\alpha)  \\\\beta \\\\rangle = (\\\\alpha + \\\\beta) \\\\widehat{D}(\\\\alpha)  \\\\beta \\\\rangle. Thus, \\\\widehat{D}(\\\\alpha)  \\\\beta \\\\rangle is an eigenstate of the annihilation operator with the eigenvalue \\\\alpha + \\\\beta, hence \\\\widehat{D}(\\\\alpha)  \\\\beta \\\\rangle =  \\\\alpha + \\\\beta \\\\rangle. In particular, :\\\\widehat{D}(-\\\\alpha)\\\\alpha\\\\rangle = 0\\\\rangle which leads to :\\\\alpha\\\\rangle=\\\\widehat{D}(\\\\alpha)0\\\\rangle. This is important as it shows that all coherent states can be obtained as displacements of the ground state, which in optics is also the vacuum state.

Early life and education Goran was born May 16, 1928 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. His parents were Jacob and Tillie Goran. Goran was raised in a housing project near the University of Pittsburgh. Although the university was close, Goran grew up among the working class culture of the projects. Although he was Jewish, his writing was heavily influenced by the culture of Irish-Americans and the goings on of the local pubs, especially the Irish Club. Goran attended Fifth Avenue High School and Schenley High School and the University of Pittsburgh for both his B.A. and M.A. which he earned in 1951 and 1961, respectively. Goran also served with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Military Police. Goran married Edythe McDowell. The couple had three children. Career Goran joined the faculty at the University of Miami in Coral Gables, Florida, starting in 1960. He became a professor of English in 1974. He founded the Creative Writing Program in the College of Arts and Sciences in 1965, In 1991, he contributed to establishing the Master of Fine Arts program. Over the course of his career as faculty at the University of Miami, he taught more than 20,000 students. Goran's work reflects a great deal about his past and upbringing. In Tales from the Irish Club: A Collection of Short Stories, Goran portrays the neighborhood of his childhood by presenting it through a series of short stories. Much of his work is influenced by Irish-American culture. The sequel to Tales from the Irish Club was She Loved Me Once, another collection of short stories. Critics welcomed She Loved Me Once as a simple and solid portrayal of Goran's boyhood community. In his novel, Bing Crosby's Last Song, Goran explores Pittsburgh through the eyes of his main character Daly Racklin. The novel takes place just before the assassination of John F. Kennedy and chronicles Daly's confrontation with heart problems and the prospect of losing his home. Critics, including Library Journal reviewer Susan Gene Clifford, said that the work was more of a \\"nostalgic snapshot\\" as opposed to a true novel. Nevertheless, the book was met with decent acclaim by most critics who praised it for its down-to-earth style. For other works by Lester Goran, see the Selected bibliography section below.

Viewing is by holding the instrument towards an external light source and looking through the magnifying eyepiece. A quartz fiber dosimeter, sometimes called a self indicating pocket dosimeter (SIPD) or self reading pocket dosimeter (SRPD) or quartz fibre electrometer (QFE), is a type of radiation dosimeter, a pen-like device that measures the cumulative dose of ionizing radiation received by the device, usually over one work period. It is clipped to a person's clothing, normally a breast pocket for whole body exposure, to measure the user's exposure to radiation. It is now being superseded by more modern dosimeter types such as the Electronic Personal Dosimeter (EPD). Use As with other types of personal radiation dosimeter, it is worn by workers who are occupationally exposed to radiation, so their employers can keep a record of their exposure, to verify that it is below legally prescribed limits. It works by measuring the decrease in electrostatic charge on a metal conductor in an ionization chamber, due to ionization of the air in the chamber by radiation. It was invented in 1937 by Charles Lauritsen. The dosimeter must be periodically recharged to restore it to a zero dose reading after being exposed to radiation. It is normally read immediately after use, and the dose is logged to record the user's exposure. In some organizations, possession of the recharging device is limited to health physicists to ensure accurate recording of exposures. It contains a low-power microscope and an illumination lens which allow direct reading of exposure at any time by aiming the illumination lens at a light source and looking into the microscope. The device is mainly sensitive to gamma and x-rays, but it also detects beta radiation above 1 MeV. Neutron sensitive versions have been made. Quartz fiber dosimeters are made in different ranges. Peace-time occupational exposure ranges usually measure up to 500 mrem (5 mSv), which exceeds the normal US yearly dose of 360 mrem (3.6 mSv). War-time fallout meters measure up to 500 rem (5 Sv), roughly the lethal dose. The quartz fiber device is an older dosimeter design. It suffers from these disadvantages: *Low accuracy: Because of the analog mechanical design, accuracy is around 15%, less than other dosimeters. *Reading errors: Since it can only be read manually it is prone to human reading errors. *Small dynamic range: The range of the device is limited by the charge on the electrode. Once the charge is gone the device stops recording exposure. So unexpected large radiation doses can quickly saturate devices designed to monitor the more usual low level exposures. Susceptibility to moisture is dealt with by separating the charging pin from the ion chamber by a small gap. The device is pushed firmly onto the charger, closing the gap and allowing the dosemeter to be reset. Releasing the dosemeter disconnects the charger pin from the ion chamber but does induce a small change in the zero which is relatively unpredictable. It consists of a sealed air-filled cylinder called an ionization chamber. Inside it is a metal electrode strip that is attached to a terminal on the end of the pen for recharging. The other end of the electrode has a delicate gold-plated quartz fiber attached to it, which at rest lies parallel to the electrode. The ends of the chamber are transparent and the microscope is focused on the fiber. During recharging, the charger applies a high DC voltage, usually around 150-200 volts, to the electrode, charging it with electrostatic charge. The quartz fiber, having the same charge, is repelled by the surface of the electrode due to the coulomb force and bends away from the electrode. After charging, the charge remains on the electrode because it is insulated. When a particle of ionizing radiation passes through the chamber, it collides with molecules of air, knocking electrons off them and creating positively and negatively charged atoms (ions) in the air. The ions of opposite charge are attracted to the electrode and neutralize some of the charge on it. The reduced charge on the electrode reduces the force on the fiber, causing it to move back toward the electrode. The position of the fiber can be read through the microscope. Behind the fiber is a scale graduated in units of radiation, with the zero point at the position of the fiber when it is fully charged. Since each radiation particle allows a certain amount of charge to leak off the electrode, the position of the fiber at any time represents the cumulative radiation that has passed through the chamber since the last recharge. Recharging restores the charge that was lost and returns the fiber to its original deflected position. The charger is a small box, usually powered by a battery. It contains an electronic circuit that steps the battery voltage up to the high voltage needed for charging. The box has a fixture that requires one to press the end of the dosimeter on the charging electrode. Some chargers include a light to illuminate the measurement electrode, so that measurement, logging and recharging can occur with one routine motion. Units with larger ranges are made by adding a capacitor attached between the electrode and the case. The capacitor stores a larger amount of charge on the device for a given voltage on the electrode. Since each radiation particle allows a fixed amount of charge to escape, a larger number of radiation particles is required to move the fiber a given amount.  Pocket ionization chamber  A version of the above dosimeter without the self-reading capabilities, called a pocket ionization chamber or just pocket chamber, was widely used in World War II and postwar government and military projects, particularly the Manhattan project. This consisted of a simple ionization chamber with an electrode running down the center, but no electroscope for reading. Instead the exposure was read by plugging the device into a separate precision electrometer/charger, which measured the decline in charge on the electrode and displayed it on a meter, before recharging the electrode. These had the advantage that they were simpler, more rugged, and cheaper than the electrometer type, but the disadvantage (considered desirable in some military applications) that the exposure couldn't be read by the wearer without the electrometer/charger. They are no longer used.  Rate meter  A similar device, used with the same charger, is a rate meter. This is an inexpensive method for civil defense persons to measure radiation rates. One measures the rate of change of the rate meter for a timed exposure after charging the rate meter. Usually one measures heavy fallout of a thirty-second period, and light fallout over a ten-minute period. The rate meter has two internal scales that read the radiation flux directly in rems for each period.

His early years were dominated by his experience of the countryside around the Lake District and the English moors. Dorothy Wordsworth, his sister, served as his early companion until their mother's death and their separation when he was sent to school. Parents Wordsworth's parents were John Wordsworth, a legal agent for James Lowther, 1st Earl of Lonsdale and Collector of Customs at Whitehaven, and his wife, Ann Cookson.Gill 1989 pp. 13‚Äì14 John was the son of Richard Wordsworth, a land owner who served as a legal agent to the Lowther family. Like his father, John became a legal agent for James Lowther, 1st Earl of LonsdaleMoorman 1968 pp. 7-8 and was made Bailiff and Recorder for Cockermouth and Coroner for the Seigniory of Millom.Gill 1989 p. 14 Ann was the daughter of William Cookson, a linen-draper, and Dorothy Crackanthorpe, daughter of a gentry family in Westmorland. They lived above Cookson's shop in Penrith, Cumbria. Ann's brother, Christopher \\"Kit\\" Crackanthorpe Cookson (later, Christopher Crackanthorpe) inherited the family estate of Newbiggin Hall.Moorman 1968 pp. 4-5 John, at the age of 26, married Ann, 18, in 1766, and he used his connections with the Lowther family to move into a large mansion in the small town of Cockermouth, Cumbria, in the Lake District. John owned many properties, in Cockermouth and Ravenglass, and he inherited a property at Sockbridge, which was originally purchased by his father and given to John after his older brother, Richard, was disinherited by their father. However, the brother's relationship was not strained by this decision, and Richard would become guardian to John's children after his death.Moorman 1968 pp. 5--8 William's mother died when he was 7 years old and he became an orphan at the age of 13 years. =Childhood= Wordsworth was born on 7 April 1770 in Cockermouth, the second of five children.Gill 1989 p. 13 His sister, the poet, and diarist Dorothy, to whom he was close all his life, was born the following year, and the two were baptized together. They had three other siblings: Richard, the eldest who became a lawyer; John, born after Dorothy, who would become a poet and enjoy nature with William and Dorothy until he died in an 1805 shipwreck; and Christopher, the youngest, who would become a scholar and eventually Master of Trinity College, Cambridge. Although he lived at his father's mansion, Wordsworth, as with his siblings, had little involvement with their father, and they would be distant with him until his death in 1783.Moorman 1968 pp. 5-7 Wordsworth's father, although rarely present, did teach him poetry, including that of Milton, Shakespeare, and Spenser, in addition to allowing his son to rely on his father's library. In addition to spending his time reading in Cockermouth, he would stay at his mother's parents home in Penrith,Moorman 1968 pp. 9-10 for extended periods of time, which took place primarily during 1775‚Äì1776 and during the winter months of 1776‚Äì1777.Gill 1989 p. 15 At Penrith, Wordsworth was exposed to the moors and was influenced by his experience with the landscape and was further turned towards nature by the harsh treatment he received at the hands of his relatives. In particular, Wordsworth could not get along with his grandparents and his uncle, and his hostile interactions with them distressed him to the point of contemplating suicide.Moorman 1968 pp. 11-13 In March 1778, Ann died of an illness, possibly pneumonia, at Penrith. After the death of his mother in 1778, his father was inconsolable and sent his children away to be raised by their relatives. William was taken in by his mother's family and eventually sent to Hawkshead Grammar School, and Dorothy was sent to live with Elizabeth Threlkeld, Ann's cousin, in Halifax. She and William did not meet again for another nine years. Although Hawkshead was Wordsworth's first serious experience with education, he was taught to read by his mother and attended a tiny school in Cockermouth of low quality.Moorman 1968 pp. 15-18 =Education and nature= At Penrith, Wordsworth was sent to a school for the children of upper-class families and taught by Ann Birkett, a woman who insisted in instilling tradition in her students that included pursuing both scholarly and local activities, especially the festivals around Easter, May Day, or Shrove Tide. Wordsworth was taught both the Bible and the Spectator, but little else. It was at the school that Wordsworth was to meet the Hutchinsons, including Mary, who would be his future wife. Life at Penrith wasn't a happy time for Wordsworth, because he was unsatisfied with his grandparents' treatment; he still spent time at his grandparents' home and their relationship was still tense. Wordsworth became rebellious to the point of destroying a family portrait.Moorman 1968 pp. 15-20 His discontent with his familial situation provoked Wordsworth to spend his time wandering away from his home, an action Wordsworth relates as uniting a childish imagination with both nature and mankind in The Prelude. He became attached to nature, and, when he was finally sent to school in Hawkshead, he was able to fully enjoy the countryside.Moorman 1968 pp. 20-22 Besides the local surroundings, Wordsworth was educated at the Hawkshead Grammar School, which had a reputation for scholarship and preparation for University entrance.Moorman 1968 pp. 25-26 A large portion of Wordsworth's education at Hawkshead was based on mathematics. The rest of the curriculum was based on teaching the classics, and it was during his classical studies that Wordsworth gained a love for Latin literature. Besides his literary education, Wordsworth and his brothers were given dancing lessons in 1785. While Wordsworth was taught at Hawkshead, he boarded with Hugh and Ann Tyson in the nearby hamlet of Colthouse, where he was exposed to the local yarn trade. The community had a strong Quaker influence, and Wordsworth, after experiencing their traditions, rejected their fixation on praising God for a relationship with the divine that would involve a more direct interaction.Moorman 1968 pp. 26-29 =College= Hawkshead School had a strong relationship with St.John's College at Cambridge University and, in October 1787, Wordsworth became an undergraduate there. Early career Wordsworth felt that his life before Samuel Taylor Coleridge was sedentary and dull and his poetry amounted to little. When Coleridge was near, he was Wordsworth's muse, and Coleridge's praise and encouragement kept Wordsworth motivated.Matlak 1978 p. 48 Dorothy described Wordsworth while around Coleridge when she wrote: \\"His faculties seem to expand every day, he composes with much more facility than he did\\".Wordsworth 1967 p. 200 It was under Coleridge's support that Wordsworth was encouraged to write poetry intended to rival Milton. When Wordsworth was forced to move from Alfoxden, Wordsworth, Coleridge, and Dorothy agreed to travel to Germany in September 1798. Originally, Coleridge and Wordsworth lived together in Hamburg, until Coleridge decided to look for a place to live at Ratzeburg. Wordsworth wanted to join his friend, but was forced to decline over monetary issues; Wordsworth was unable to provide for both himself and his sister in such an expensive town, and they instead moved to Goslar. The separation, with the expenses, made it impossible for Wordsworth to spend time with Coleridge until after the winter of 1798.Matlak 1978 pp. 48‚Äì49 Wordsworth continued to write even without the support of Coleridge's company, and from October 1798 to February 1799 Wordsworth began writing the \\"Matthew\\" poems along with the \\"Lucy\\" poems and other poems. These poems express the frustration and anxiety that Wordsworth was feelingMatlak 1978 pp. 46‚Äì47 In particular, it is possible that the \\"Lucy\\" poems allowed Wordsworth to vent his frustration with his sister, and that they contain the subconscious desire for his sister to die.Bateson 1954 p. 153 The two poems are thematically unique compared to Wordsworth's other poems,Grob 1973 p. 192 especially in their portrayal of lossHartman 1967 p. 285 and a lack of faith that nature is able to provide comfort or solutions to life's problems.Grob 1973 pp. 10-11 This reversal of Wordsworth's view of nature provoked Alan Grob to suggest that the two sets of poems should be known \\"as the Goslar lyrics of 1799\\".Grob 1973 p. 201 Early works Besides an emphasis on nature, as Bennett Weaver points out, \\"The dominant theme of the poems of 1799 is death: death for the children of the village school, for Matthew's daughter, and for Lucy Gray.\\"Weaver 1960 p. 233 =Lyrical Ballads= In his \\"Preface to Lyrical Ballads\\", which is called the \\"manifesto\\" of English Romantic criticism, Wordsworth calls his poems \\"experimental\\". The year 1793 saw Wordsworth's first published poetry, with the collections An Evening Walk and Descriptive Sketches. He received a legacy of ¬£900 from Raisley Calvert in 1795 so that he could pursue writing poetry. That year, he met Samuel Taylor Coleridge in Somerset. The two poets quickly developed a close friendship. In 1797, Wordsworth and his sister Dorothy moved to Alfoxton House, Somerset, just a few miles away from Coleridge's home in Nether Stowey. Together, Wordsworth and Coleridge (with insights from Dorothy) produced Lyrical Ballads (1798), an important work in the English Romantic movement. The volume gave neither Wordsworth's nor Coleridge's name as author. One of Wordsworth's most famous poems, \\"Tintern Abbey\\", was published in the work, along with Coleridge's \\"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner\\". The second edition, published in 1800, had only Wordsworth listed as the author, and included a preface to the poems, which was augmented significantly in the 1802 edition. This Preface to Lyrical Ballads is considered a central work of Romantic literary theory. In it, Wordsworth discusses what he sees as the elements of a new type of poetry, one based on the \\"real language of men\\" and which avoids the poetic diction of much 18th-century poetry. Here, Wordsworth gives his famous definition of poetry as \\"the spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings: it takes its origin from emotion recollected in tranquility.\\" A fourth and final edition of Lyrical Ballads was published in 1805. =Prelude= In 1799, Wordsworth completed a version of his Prelude, which was, according to Stephen Gill, \\"the most sustained self-examination in English poetry\\". In Wordsworth's 1799 Prelude, he attempted to write a biography about the growth of his mind from childhood to the current time. However, he realized that this could never be complete and wrote: ::But who shall parcel out :His intellect by geometric rules, :Split like a province into round and square? :Who knows the individual hour in which :His habits were first sown even as a seed? :Who that shall point as with a wand, and say :'This portion of the river of my mind :Came from yon fountain'? (Prelude II 243-249) The 1799 Prelude describes Wordsworth's early, happy moments in Cockermouth with a particular focus on the River Derwent and Cockermouth Castle. The poem transitions into the happy moments at Hawkshead, skipping over Wordsworth's experience with his mother's family, and only one scene containing his experience in Penrith was introduced in Book XII of the 1805 edition.Moorman 1968 pp. 12‚Äì13 Notes References * Bateson, F.

He was born in a very poor family but managed to study art in both Mexico and Italy, beginning his art career in Europe. He moved back to Mexico in the 1960s, but kept career ties in Europe with several commissions as well as exhibitions. Although he was a prolific creator, there are only about 1,500 of his works in existence because of his early death at age 47. His works can be found in museums and private collections in Europe (including the Vatican) and Mexico. Life Born in Mexico City, Francisco Corzas was the last of eight children of Enrique Corzas and Regina Ch√°vez, who were musicians originally from Quecholac, Puebla. He grew up in the rough Tepito neighborhood and was nicknamed Pancho. His family was extremely poor and has a child Corzas dreamed of being a bullfighter or a boxer to better his lot. However, he spent time creating drawings on the bathroom wall using pieces of coal, the first indication of his artistic talent. At the age of fourteen, he enrolled in La Esmeralda, with his mother‚Äôs support, despite their still dire financial circumstances. He studied there from 1951 to 1955 under teachers such as Agust√≠n Lazo, Manuel Rodr√≠guez Lozano, Carlos Orozco Romero, Mar√≠a Izquierdo and Juan Soriano . During this time, he discovered that he could not only paint, but had an exceptional baritone voice, which would serve him economically as well. One of these endeavors was the formation of the group Trio La Esmeralda with Felipe Za√∫l Pe√±a and Ra√∫l Anguiano, which performed at student parties. In 1956, at the age of nineteen, Corzas went to Italy to study, accompanied by Humberto Kubli. Kubli returned to Mexico soon after, but Corzas stayed in Rome in the ancient Trastevere neighborhood. He considered his three years there to be his real formation as a painter. He studied fresco painting at the Accademia San Giacomo and figure drawing at the Brera Academy. However, more importantly, his time in Europe allowed him to visit various museums to learn about and develop a passion for classic European art, which had great influence on his aesthetics. To support himself, he toured parts of Europe to earn money singing. In Italy in 1967, Corzas met his future wife, Bianca Dall‚ÄôOcca, a young widow eleven years his senior. They met at a restaurant where Francisco was painting a mural and where Bianca sang and played the guitar in exchange for meals. The relationship began as a friendship, taking long walks and conversing. Bianca followed Corzas to Mexico to marry him and they remained together until his death. However, the relationship was rocky. Corzas was fascinated by music, poetry, dance, and the pleasures of life, including romantic affairs. He had mood swings as well and Bianca worked to create order in his life and provide stability. Corzas returned to live in Mexico in the 1960s but returned to Europe again for a time in the 1970s to live and work. Corzas died in 1983 in Mexico City at the age of forty-seven after battling an illness for three years. For the time prior to his death, he painted almost constantly, even at night, leading to speculation that he foresaw his end. Career Corzas began his art career while still studying in Europe in the latter 1950s. He returned to Mexico in 1962, but struggled for a time because his work was not yet well appreciated. Although he worked almost constantly, he produced only about 1,500 works because of his untimely death. His last work, called La modelo, was auctioned off in 2011. It was created during the last days of his life. He had fourteen individual exhibitions and participated in forty three in various countries of the world including Rome, Florence, Venice, Belgrade, Prague, Brussels, Vienna, New Delhi, Mumbai, Osaka, New York, San Antonio, Los Angeles, Montreal, Bogota, Buenos Aires, Rio de Janeiro and Santiago de Chile. The first individual exhibition was at the YMCA in Rome in 1958, followed by another at the Trentadue Gallery in Milan and various collective exhibitions. When he returned to Mexico he initially showed his work at the Antonio Souza Gallery. However, his first important exhibition was that of large-scale figurative works at the Galer√≠a Misrachi in 1962. By 1972, he was important enough to warrant a retrospective at the Palacio de Bellas Artes called ‚ÄúFrancisco Corzas, 1962-1972, followed by an individual show at the Museo de Arte Moderno in 1976. His work remained recognized in Europe after he moved back to Mexico, with invitations to produce work there and in the United States. He spent time again in Europe in the 1970s, receiving a Des Art grant from the French government. He spent a year at the Bramsen workshop in Paris then traveled to various European countries. He created ten lithographs called los Profetas at the Caprina Graphics workshop in Rome and one other called Umbr√≠o por la pena with the Upiglio workshop in Milan, and eleven lithographs related to the Carmina Burana with the Olivetti workshop. He also did painting, producing two canvases for the Vatican called Profeta (found in Room 12) and Plegaria (in the Stampa Room) . In addition to those commissions, he also received one for ten lithographs for Lublin Press in New York as well as one from the Fundaci√≥n Cultural Televisa to create a work called Agon√≠as y otras ofrendas. The first recognition of his work was a silver medal at the Via Margutta International Fair in Rome in 1958, which gave his work international notice. He also participated in competitions in Oslo, Frenchen (Germany) and San Juan, Puerto Rico. In Mexico, he received an honorary mention from the Sal√≥n de la Pl√°stica Mexicana, of which he became a member. In 1964 he received the first Acquisition Prize of Sal√≥n 65 of Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes. In 1998, fifteen years after his death, there was a homage to the artist at the Centro Cultural San √Ångel, with Jos√© Luis Cuevas, Rafael Coronel, Javier Ju√°rez and Raymundo Sesma among others. Much of his work is found outside of Mexico, some in museums and others in private collections. In Mexico, his work can be found in the Museo de Arte Moderno (la Empaquetada (1966)) and the Museo Carrillo Gil, as well as the Fundaci√≥n Cultural Televisa. Artistry Francisco Corzas is considered to be part of Mexico's Generaci√≥n de la Ruptura, the generations of artists in the 20th century who rebelled against the artistic and political precepts of Mexican muralism. These artists experimented with other forms of expression. In Corzas case, a new kind of figurative expression that left much of the definition to the imagination, especially the background, giving the works an ethereal quality. He was a prolific artist that worked on several projects at a time. He always painted with a drink at hand, listening to operatic arias at full volume. Corzas described his work as impressionism, with strong influence from Goya; however, it has also been classified as expressionism. Corzas‚Äô strongest influence on his artistic development came from his time in Italy and his study of European movements from the Renaissance, to Baroque, to Mannerism and the more modern avant garde. Among the painters Corzas most admired was Correggio, Veronese, Tintoretto, Velazquez and especially Goya. He even signed some of his very early works with the pseudonym of ‚ÄúGoya.‚Äù He was profoundly attracted by the past and images from the past often appeared in his work such as figures in old fashioned garments and large hats. His preferred themes included sensual and erotic female nudes, among the best being melancholic, sadly beautiful women among faded colors that suggest a bed or a shawl. His early works focus on images of mutilated bodies and ghost like faces, often enveloped in light. Orange tones dominated and contrasted with the faces. He did not use models, basing the faces of his human figures on stories he read and some completely invented. Elements of his own face can be found in many of the figures. In addition to human, other elements included animals, which often accompanied the female nudes. These included owls, bulls, cats and especially horses. Elements of dance appeared because of his relationship with music. His formation of images was not completely realistic, leaving a lack of definition in the forms, especially the background elements. This gives the works a mysteriousness, accentuated by the play of light and shadow as well as the use of limited colors such as yellows, dark ochre and black.

Philosophical work Russell is generally credited with being one of the founders of analytic philosophy, but he also produced a body of work that covers logic, the philosophy of mathematics, metaphysics, ethics and epistemology. =Analytic philosophy= Bertrand Russell helped to develop what is now called \\"Analytic Philosophy.\\" Alongside G. E. Moore, Russell was shown to be partly responsible for the British revolt against idealism, a philosophy greatly influenced by G. W. F. Hegel and his British apostle, F. H. Bradley. This revolt was echoed 30 years later in Vienna by the logical positivists' \\"revolt against metaphysics.\\" Russell was particularly critical of a doctrine he ascribed to idealism and coherentism, which he dubbed the doctrine of internal relations; this, Russell suggested, held that to know any particular thing, we must know all of its relations. Russell argued that this would make space, time, science and the concept of number not fully intelligible. Russell's logical work with Whitehead continued this project. Russell and Moore were devoted to clarity in arguments by breaking down philosophical positions into their simplest components. Russell, in particular, saw formal logic and science as the principal tools of the philosopher. Russell did not think we should have separate methods for philosophy. Russell thought philosophers should strive to answer the most general of propositions about the world and this would help eliminate confusions. In particular, he wanted to end what he saw as the excesses of metaphysics. Russell adopted William of Ockham's principle against multiplying unnecessary entities, Occam's razor, as a central part of the method of analysis. =Logic and philosophy of mathematics= Russell had great influence on modern mathematical logic. The American philosopher and logician Willard Quine said Russell's work represented the greatest influence on his own work.\\"Quine, Willard Van Orman.\\" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. 2008. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online. Accessed 23 February 2008. Russell's first mathematical book, An Essay on the Foundations of Geometry, was published in 1897. This work was heavily influenced by Immanuel Kant. The book was highly praised but according to the author \\"far more in fact than it deserved\\".The Autobiography of Bertrand Russell, George Allen and Unwin Ltd., 1971, p.130. This work's academic reputation was so good at the time that \\"reviewers have generally said of each successive book of mine that it showed a falling-off\\". Russell later realised that the conception it laid out would make Albert Einstein's schema of space-time impossible. Thenceforth, he rejected the entire Kantian program as it related to mathematics and geometry, and rejected his own earliest work on the subject. Interested in the definition of number, Russell studied the work of George Boole, Georg Cantor, and Augustus De Morgan. Materials in the Bertrand Russell Archives at McMaster University include notes of his reading in algebraic logic by Charles Sanders Peirce and Ernst Schr√∂der.Bertrand Russell Archives at McMaster UniversityIrving H. Anellis, \\"Schr√∂der Material at the Russell Archives\\", Modern Logic 1 (1990‚Äì1991), 237‚Äì247. In 1900 he attended the first International Congress of Philosophy in Paris, where he became familiar with the work of the Italian mathematician, Giuseppe Peano. He mastered Peano's new symbolism and his set of axioms for arithmetic. Peano defined logically all of the terms of these axioms with the exception of 0, number, successor, and the singular term, the, which were the primitives of his system. Russell took it upon himself to find logical definitions for each of these. Between 1897 and 1903 he published several articles applying Peano's notation to the classical Boole-Schr√∂der algebra of relations, among them On the Notion of Order, Sur la logique des relations avec les applications √† la th√©orie des s√©ries, and On Cardinal Numbers. He became convinced that the foundations of mathematics could be derived within what has since come to be called higher-order logic which in turn he believed to include some form of unrestricted comprehension axiom. Russell then discovered that Gottlob Frege had independently arrived at equivalent definitions for 0, successor, and number, and the definition of number is now usually referred to as the Frege-Russell definition.Griffin, Nicholas ed. The Cambridge Companion to Bertrand Russell. Cambridge. 2003. p. 412 Russell drew attention to Frege's priority in 1903, when he published The Principles of Mathematics (see below).Russell's The Principles of Mathematics The appendix to this work, however, described a paradox arising from Frege's application of second- and higher-order functions which took first-order functions as their arguments, and Russell offered his first effort to resolve what would henceforth come to be known as the Russell Paradox. Before writing Principles, Russell became aware of Cantor's proof that there was no greatest cardinal number, which Russell believed was mistaken.The Autobiography of Bertrand Russell, George Allen and Unwin Ltd., 1971, p.147. The Cantor's paradox in turn was shown (for example by Crossley) to be a special case of the Russell Paradox. This caused Russell to analyse classes, for it was known that given any number of elements, the number of classes they result in is greater than their number. This in turn led to the discovery of a very interesting class, namely, the class of all classes. It contains two kinds of classes: those classes that contain themselves, and those that do not. Consideration of this class led him to find a fatal flaw in the so-called principle of comprehension, which had been taken for granted by logicians of the time. He showed that it resulted in a contradiction, whereby Y is a member of Y, if and only if, Y is not a member of Y. This has become known as Russell's paradox, the solution to which he outlined in an appendix to Principles, and which he later developed into a complete theory, the theory of types. Aside from exposing a major inconsistency in naive set theory, Russell's work led directly to the creation of modern axiomatic set theory. It also crippled Frege's project of reducing arithmetic to logic. The Theory of Types and much of Russell's subsequent work have also found practical applications with computer science and information technology. Russell continued to defend logicism, the view that mathematics is in some important sense reducible to logic, and along with his former teacher, Alfred North Whitehead, wrote the monumental Principia Mathematica, an axiomatic system on which all of mathematics can be built. The first volume of the Principia was published in 1910, and is largely ascribed to Russell. More than any other single work, it established the speciality of mathematical or symbolic logic. Two more volumes were published, but their original plan to incorporate geometry in a fourth volume was never realised, and Russell never felt up to improving the original works, though he referenced new developments and problems in his preface to the second edition. Upon completing the Principia, three volumes of extraordinarily abstract and complex reasoning, Russell was exhausted, and he felt his intellectual faculties never fully recovered from the effort.The Autobiography of Bertrand Russell, the Early Years, p. 202. Although the Principia did not fall prey to the paradoxes in Frege's approach, it was later proven by Kurt G√∂del that neither Principia Mathematica, nor any other consistent system of primitive recursive arithmetic, could, within that system, determine that every proposition that could be formulated within that system was decidable, i.e. could decide whether that proposition or its negation was provable within the system (See: G√∂del's incompleteness theorem). Russell's last significant work in mathematics and logic, Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy, was written while he was in jail for his anti-war activities during World War I. This was largely an explication of his previous work and its philosophical significance. =Philosophy of language= Russell made language, or more specifically, how we use language, a central part of philosophy, and this influenced Ludwig Wittgenstein, Gilbert Ryle, J. L. Austin, and P. F. Strawson, among others, who used many of the techniques that Russell originally developed. Russell, and GE Moore, argued that clarity of expression is a virtue. A significant contribution to philosophy of language is Russell's theory of descriptions, set out in On Denoting (Mind, 1905). Frank P. Ramsey described this paper as \\"a paradigm of philosophy.\\" The theory considers the sentence \\"The present King of France is bald\\" and whether the proposition is false or meaningless. Frege had argued, employing his distinction between sense and reference, that such sentences were meaningful but neither true nor false. Russell argues that the grammatical form of the sentence disguises its underlying logical form. Russell's Theory of Definite Descriptions enables the sentence to be construed as meaningful but false, without commitment to the existence of any present King of France. This addresses a paradox of great antiquity (e.g. \\"That which is not must in some sense be. Otherwise, how could we say of it that it is not?\\" etc.), going back at least as far as Parmenides. In Russell's own time, Meinong held the view of that which is not being in some sense real; and Russell held this view prior to On Denoting. Principles of Mathematics (1903) pg. 449. The problem is general to what are called \\"definite descriptions.\\" Normally this includes all terms beginning with \\"the,\\" and sometimes includes names, like \\"Walter Scott.\\" (This point is quite contentious: Russell sometimes thought that the latter terms shouldn't be called names at all, but only \\"disguised definite descriptions,\\" but much subsequent work has treated them as altogether different things.) What is the \\"logical form\\" of definite descriptions: how, in Frege's terms, could we paraphrase them to show how the truth of the whole depends on the truths of the parts? Definite descriptions appear to be like names that by their very nature denote exactly one thing, neither more nor less. What, then, are we to say about the proposition as a whole if one of its parts apparently isn't functioning correctly? Russell's solution was, first of all, to analyse not the term alone but the entire proposition that contained a definite description. \\"The present king of France is bald,\\" he then suggested, can be reworded to \\"There is an x such that x is a present king of France, nothing other than x is a present king of France, and x is bald.\\" Russell claimed that each definite description in fact contains a claim of existence and a claim of uniqueness which give this appearance, but these can be broken apart and treated separately from the predication that is the obvious content of the proposition. The proposition as a whole then says three things about some object: the definite description contains two of them, and the rest of the sentence contains the other. If the object does not exist, or if it is not unique, then the whole sentence turns out to be false, not meaningless. One of the major complaints against Russell's theory, due originally to Strawson, is that definite descriptions do not claim that their object exists, they merely presuppose that it does. Wittgenstein, Russell's student, achieved considerable prominence in the philosophy of language after the posthumous publication of the Philosophical Investigations. In Russell's opinion, Wittgenstein's later work was misguided, and he decried its influence and that of its followers (especially members of the so-called \\"Oxford school\\" of ordinary language philosophy, who he believed were promoting a kind of mysticism). He wrote a foreword to Ernest Gellner's Words and Things which was a fierce attack on the Oxford School of Ordinary Language philosophy and Wittgenstein's later work and was supportive of Gellner in the subsequent academic dispute. However, Russell still held Wittgenstein and his early work in high regard, he thought of him as, \\"perhaps the most perfect example I have ever known of genius as traditionally conceived, passionate, profound, intense, and dominating.\\"The Autobio. of B. Russell, pg. 329. Russell's belief that philosophy's task is not limited to examining ordinary language is once again widely accepted in philosophy. =Logical atomism= Russell explained his philosophy of logical atomism in a set of lectures, \\"The Philosophy of Logical Atomism\\", which he gave in 1918. In these lectures, Russell sets forth his concept of an ideal, isomorphic language, one that would mirror the world, whereby our knowledge can be reduced to terms of atomic propositions and their truth-functional compounds. Logical atomism is a form of radical empiricism, for Russell believed the most important requirement for such an ideal language is that every meaningful proposition must consist of terms referring directly to the objects with which we are acquainted, or that they are defined by other terms referring to objects with which we are acquainted. Russell excluded some formal, logical terms such as all, the, is, and so forth, from his isomorphic requirement, but he was never entirely satisfied with our understanding of such terms. One of the central themes of Russell's atomism is that the world consists of logically independent facts, a plurality of facts, and that our knowledge depends on the data of our direct experience of them. In his later life, Russell came to doubt aspects of logical atomism, especially his principle of isomorphism, though he continued to believe that the process of philosophy ought to consist of breaking things down into their simplest components, even though we might not ever fully arrive at an ultimate atomic fact. =Epistemology= Russell's epistemology went through many phases. Once he shed neo-Hegelianism in his early years, Russell remained a philosophical realist for the remainder of his life, believing that our direct experiences have primacy in the acquisition of knowledge. While some of his views have lost favour, his influence remains strong in the distinction between two ways in which we can be familiar with objects: \\"knowledge by acquaintance\\" and \\"knowledge by description\\". For a time, Russell thought that we could only be acquainted with our own sense data‚Äîmomentary perceptions of colours, sounds, and the like‚Äîand that everything else, including the physical objects that these were sense data of, could only be inferred, or reasoned to‚Äîi.e. known by description‚Äîand not known directly. This distinction has gained much wider application, though Russell eventually rejected the idea of an intermediate sense datum. In his later philosophy, Russell subscribed to a kind of neutral monism, maintaining that the distinctions between the material and mental worlds, in the final analysis, were arbitrary, and that both can be reduced to a neutral property‚Äîa view similar to one held by the American philosopher/psychologist, William James, and one that was first formulated by Baruch Spinoza, whom Russell greatly admired. Instead of James' \\"pure experience,\\" however, Russell characterised the stuff of our initial states of perception as \\"events,\\" a stance which is curiously akin to his old teacher Whitehead's process philosophy. =Philosophy of science= Russell claimed that he was more convinced of his method of doing philosophy than of his philosophical conclusions. Science was one of the principal components of analysis. Russell was a believer in the scientific method, that science reaches only tentative answers, that scientific progress is piecemeal, and attempts to find organic unities were largely futile. He believed the same was true of philosophy. Russell held that the ultimate objective of both science and philosophy was to understand reality, not simply to make predictions. Russell's work contributed to philosophy of science's development into a separate branch of philosophy. Much of Russell's thinking about science is expressed in his 1914 book, Our Knowledge of the External World as a Field for Scientific Method in Philosophy, which influenced the logical positivists. Russell held that of the physical world we know only its abstract structure except for the intrinsic character of our own brain with which we have direct acquaintance (Russell, 1948). Russell saidin a letter to Newman which has been reprinted in Russell's autobiography) that he had always assumed copunctuality between percepts and non-percepts, and percepts were also part of the physical world, a part of which we knew its intrinsic character directly, knowledge which goes beyond structure. His views on science have become integrated into the contemporary debate in the philosophy of science as a form of Structural Realism, people such as Elie Zahar and Ioannis Votsis have discussed the implications of his work for our understanding of science. The seminal article \\"The Concept of Structure in The Analysis of Matter\\" by William Demopoulos and Michael Friedman was crucial in reintegrating Russell's views to the contemporary scene. Russell wrote several science books, including The ABC of Atoms (1923) and The ABC of Relativity (1925). =Ethics= While Russell wrote a great deal on ethical subject matters, he did not believe that the subject belonged to philosophy or that when he wrote on ethics that he did so in his capacity as a philosopher. In his earlier years, Russell was greatly influenced by G.E. Moore's Principia Ethica. Along with Moore, he then believed that moral facts were objective, but known only through intuition; that they were simple properties of objects, not equivalent (e.g., pleasure is good) to the natural objects to which they are often ascribed (see Naturalistic fallacy); and that these simple, undefinable moral properties cannot be analysed using the non-moral properties with which they are associated. In time, however, he came to agree with his philosophical hero, David Hume, who believed that ethical terms dealt with subjective values that cannot be verified in the same way as matters of fact. Coupled with Russell's other doctrines, this influenced the logical positivists, who formulated the theory of emotivism or non-cognitivism, which states that ethical propositions (along with those of metaphysics) were essentially meaningless and nonsensical or, at best, little more than expressions of attitudes and preferences. Notwithstanding his influence on them, Russell himself did not construe ethical propositions as narrowly as the positivists, for he believed that ethical considerations are not only meaningful, but that they are a vital subject matter for civil discourse. Indeed, though Russell was often characterised as the patron saint of rationality, he agreed with Hume, who said that reason ought to be subordinate to ethical considerations. In terms of his normative ethical beliefs, Russell considered himself a utilitarianThe Autobiography of Bertrand Russell, London: Routledge, 2000 [London: Allen and Unwin, 1969, Vol. 1], p. 39 (\\"It appeared to me obvious that the happiness of mankind should be the aim of all action, and I discovered to my surprise that there were those who thought otherwise. Belief in happiness, I found, was called Utilitarianism, and was merely one among a number of ethical theories. I adhered to it after this discovery.\\"). early in his life. =Religion and theology= For most of his adult life Russell maintained that religion is little more than superstition and, despite any positive effects that religion might have, it is largely harmful to people. He believed religion and the religious outlook (he considered communism and other systematic ideologies to be forms of religion) serve to impede knowledge, foster fear and dependency, and are responsible for much of the war, oppression, and misery that have beset the world. In his 1949 speech, \\"Am I an Atheist or an Agnostic?\\", Russell expressed his difficulty over whether to call himself an atheist or an agnostic: However, in the 1948 BBC Radio Debate between Bertrand Russell and Frederick Copleston, Russell chose to assume the position of the agnostic, though it seems to have been because he admitted to not being able to prove the non-existence of God: Though he would later question God's existence, he fully accepted the ontological argument during his undergraduate years: This quote has been used by many theologians over the years, such as by Louis Pojman in his Philosophy of Religion, who wish for readers to believe that even a well-known atheist-philosopher supported this particular argument for God's existence. However, elsewhere in his autobiography, Russell also mentions: Russell made an influential analysis of the omphalos hypothesis enunciated by Philip Henry Gosse‚Äîthat any argument suggesting that the world was created as if it were already in motion could just as easily make it a few minutes old as a few thousand years: As a young man, Russell had a decidedly religious bent, himself, as is evident in his early Platonism. He longed for eternal truths, as he makes clear in his famous essay, \\"A Free Man's Worship\\", widely regarded as a masterpiece of prose, but a work that Russell came to dislike. While he rejected the supernatural, he freely admitted that he yearned for a deeper meaning to life. Russell's views on religion can be found in his book, Why I Am Not a Christian and Other Essays on Religion and Related Subjects. Its title essay was a talk given on 6 March 1927 at Battersea Town Hall, under the auspices of the South London Branch of the National Secular Society, UK, and published later that year as a pamphlet. The book also contains other essays in which Russell considers a number of logical arguments for the existence of God, including the first cause argument, the natural-law argument, the argument from design, and moral arguments. He also discusses specifics about Christian theology. His conclusion: Influence on philosophy As Nicholas Griffin points out in the introduction to The Cambridge Companion to Bertrand Russell, Russell had a major influence on modern philosophy, especially in the English-speaking world. While others were also influential, notably Frege, Moore, and Wittgenstein, Russell made analysis the dominant methodology of professional philosophy. The various analytic movements throughout the last century all owe something to Russell's earlier works. Even Russell's biographer, the philosopher Ray Monk, no admirer of Russell's personal snobbery, characterised his work on the philosophy of mathematics as intense, august and incontestably greatMonk, Ray. The Ghost of Madness. Jonathan Cape. 2000. p. 5. and acknowledged, in the preface to the second volume of his biography, that he is one of the indisputably great philosophers of the twentieth century. Russell's influence on individual philosophers is singular, especially in the case of Ludwig Wittgenstein, who was his student between 1911 and 1914. Wittgenstein had an important influence on Russell as he himself discusses in his My Philosophical Development. He led him, for example, to conclude, much to his regret, that mathematical truths were purely tautological truths, however it is doubtful that Wittgenstein actually held this view, which he discussed in relation to logical truth, since it is not clear that he was a logicist when he wrote the Tractatus. What is certain is that in 1901 Russell's own reflections on the issues raised by the paradox that takes his name Russell's paradox, led him to doubt the intuitive certainty of mathematics. This doubt was perhaps Russell's most important 'influence' on mathematics, and was spread throughout the European universities, even as Russell himself laboured (with Alfred North Whitehead) in an attempt to solve the Paradox and related paradoxes, such as Burali- Forti. As Stewart Shapiro explains in his Thinking About Mathematics, Russell's attempts to solve the paradoxes led to the ramified theory of types, which, though it is highly complex and relies on the doubtful axiom of reducibility, actually manages to solve both syntactic and semantic paradoxes at the expense of rendering the logicist project suspect and introducing much complexity in the PM system. Philosopher and logician F.P. Ramsey would later simplify the theory of types arguing that there was no need to solve both semantic and syntactic paradoxes to provide a foundation for mathematics. The philosopher and logician George Boolos discusses the power of the PM system in the preface to his Logic, logic & logic, stating that it is powerful enough to derive most classical mathematics, equating the power of PM to that of Z, a weaker form of set theory than ZFC (Zermelo-Fraenkel Set theory with Choice). In fact, ZFC actually does circumvent Russell's paradox by restricting the comprehension axiom to already existing sets by the use of subset axioms.Enderton, Herbert. Elements of Set Theory. Academic Press. 1977. Russell wrote (in Portraits from Memory, 1956) of his reaction to G√∂del's 'Theorems of Undecidability': Evidence of Russell's influence on Wittgenstein can be seen throughout the Tractatus, which Russell was instrumental in having published. Russell also helped to secure Wittgenstein's doctorateThe Autobio. of B. Russell, pgs. 435‚Äì440. and a faculty position at Cambridge, along with several fellowships along the way.The Autobio. of B. Russell, pgs. 351‚Äì353. However, as previously stated, he came to disagree with Wittgenstein's later linguistic and analytic approach to philosophy dismissing it as \\"trivial\\", while Wittgenstein came to think of Russell as \\"superficial and glib\\", particularly in his popular writings. However, Norman Malcolm tells us in his recollections of Wittgenstein that Wittgenstein showed a deference towards Russell such as he never saw him show towards any one, and even went so far as to reprimand students of his who criticised Russell. As Ray Monk relates in his biography of Wittgenstein, Wittgenstein used to say that Russell's books should be bound in two covers, those dealing with mathematical philosophy in blue, and every student of philosophy should read them, while those dealing with popular subjects should be bound in red and no one should be allowed to read them. Russell's influence is also evident in the work of Alfred J. Ayer, Rudolf Carnap, Alonzo Church, Kurt G√∂del, David Kaplan, Saul Kripke, Karl Popper, W. V. Quine, John R. Searle, and a number of other philosophers and logicians. Russell often characterised his moral and political writings as lying outside the scope of philosophy, but Russell's admirers and detractors are often more acquainted with his pronouncements on social and political matters, or what some (e.g., biographer Ray Monk) have called his \\"journalism,\\" than they are with his technical, philosophical work. There is a marked tendency to conflate these matters, and to judge Russell the philosopher on what he himself would definitely consider to be his non- philosophical opinions. Russell often cautioned people to make this distinction. Beginning in the 1920s, Russell wrote frequently for The Nation on changing morals, disarmament and literature. In 1965, he wrote that the magazine \\"...has been one of the few voices which has been heard on behalf of individual liberty and social justice consistently throughout its existence.\\"Katrina Vanden Heuvel The Nation 1865‚Äì1990, p. 136, Thunder's Mouth Press, 1990 Russell left a large assortment of writing. From his adolescent years, he wrote about 3,000 words a day, with relatively few corrections; his first draft nearly always was his last, even on the most complex, technical matters. His previously unpublished work is an immense treasure trove, and scholars continue to gain new insights into Russell's thought.

Sadler documented the tropical cyclones over the eastern North Pacific that were revealed by satellite observations, and suggested that the upper-tropospheric circulation is a factor of development, as well as the life history of the tropical cyclones. Using charts of mean 200-hectopascal circulation for July through August to locate the circumpolar troughs and ridges, he observed that there is a trough line extending over the eastern and central North Pacific and another one extending over the North Atlantic. He also stated that the summer tropical upper tropospheric trough in the Southern Hemisphere lies over the trade wind region of the east central Pacific and can induce tropical cyclones.

In 1965 Reeb, Jean Leray and Pierre Lelong founded a series of encounters between theoretical physicists and mathematicians in Strasbourg (Rencontres entre Math√©maticiens et Physiciens Th√©oriciens). He was a professor at Universit√© Joseph Fourier in Grenoble and Universit√© Louis Pasteur in Strasbourg where he directed the Institute for Advanced Mathematical Research at University of Strasbourg between 1967 and 1972, which he founded with Jean Frenkel in 1966. Reeb was the founder of the topological theory of foliations (Feuilletages, Bl√§tterungen), manifolds with a special local product structure. He invented what is now called the Reeb foliation, a foliation of the 3-sphere, all the leaves of which are diffeomorphic to R2, except one, which is a (compact!) 2-torus. Reeb sphere theorem says that a compact manifold with a function with exactly two critical points is homeomorphic to the sphere. This is used to prove that the Milnor spheres, although not diffeomorphic, are homeomorphic to the sphere S7, a result that came in 1956. Other terms named for Reeb are: *Reeb graph *Reeb vector field *Reeb stability theorem Reeb received an honorary doctorate from the Albert-Ludwigs-Universit√§t Freiburg and from the Universit√© de Neuch√¢tel.

Education and career  Fung and her younger sister are the daughters of Kellog and Joyce Fung. She was born in Hong Kong,CBC News - The National - Mellissa Fung and her family moved to Vancouver when she was four years old. There, she attended an all-girls Catholic high school, then completed a Bachelor of Arts at the University of British Columbia where she contributed regularly to the student-run newspaper The Ubyssey. After graduating in 1994, she earned a master's degree from Columbia School of Journalism in 1995. From February 2001 to 2003 she reported for CBC-TV News in Vancouver. Since December 2003, she has served as a national reporter for CBC Television, working out of Toronto and Regina. In her time as a national correspondent she has covered numerous topics on both Canadian and world affairs, including the Robert Pickton trial, the 2003 SARS outbreak in Canada, the trial of Mike Danton, the 2007 Saskatchewan provincial election, 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing and uncovering Canada's international sales of toxic asbestos. In 2007 and 2008 she was sent on assignment to Afghanistan to cover the Canadian military presence there.  2008 kidnapping  In late 2008, Fung was sent on her second assignment to Afghanistan, based out of the Canadian military base at Kandahar. On October 12, while en route to a refugee camp near Kabul, she was kidnapped by armed men. Fung alerted her employer using her mobile phone and stated that the kidnappers were not Taliban but \\"bandits\\". Her translator and driver‚Äîtwo Afghan brothers named Shokoor Feroz and Qaem Feroz‚Äîwere beaten and left behind by the kidnappers. Before her captors abandoned her for the last week, she was blindfolded and chained to the inside of a tiny, dark cave. Zabiullah Mujahid, a Taliban spokesman in the eastern part of the county, told The Canadian Press that another Islamist group called Hizb-e-Islami was responsible for the abduction. They were later implicated by Afghan authorities in the kidnapping and detained, though CBC publisher John Cruickshank expressed confidence in them and stated that they were worried about their conditions in prison. The kidnapping occurred two days before the 2008 Canadian federal election, and CBC requested a press blackout while negotiations were conducted with the kidnappers, out of concern that widespread media coverage would complicate matters. Though the incident was covered in Afghan press, the blackout was honoured by all Canadian media and Fung's kidnapping remained generally unknown within Canada. Fung was finally released on November 8, 2008 after weeks of negotiations. A spokesman for the governor of Wardak Province indicated that local tribal elders and provincial council members negotiated Fung's release and that no ransom was paid. However, it was later revealed that Afghan intelligence determined the identity of the kidnapper, abducted his family, then demanded Fung be released in a prisoner exchange. She was interviewed about her kidnapping on November 12, 2008, by CBC Radio's Anna Maria Tremonti, in Dubai. The interview later earned Tremonti and Fung a gold medal at the 2009 New York Festivals Radio Programming and Promotion Awards. Fung wrote the book Under an Afghan Sky about her experiences. During an interview with a columnist from The Globe and Mail, she said \\"I thought it might be cathartic...But it wasn‚Äôt.\\" On May 5, 2011, Fung was interviewed by CBC radio and CBC TV to talk about her experience and her book.

Thomas Underhill was born the son of Sir Hugh Underhill and one of Thomas Maynman's daughters in 1545 at Greenwich, then in the County of Kent. Maynman served as Keeper of the Wardrobe at East Greenwich, the location of the Palace of Placentia.

In the North of England it is often known as a creel, in Scotland as a pulley, and in United States as a Sheila Maid. History Overhead clothes airers were often installed, from the late eighteenth century onwards, in the laundry room of large houses and estates in Europe. Originally made by the estate handyman, by the middle of the 19th century they almost always benefited from a rope and pulley system to raise and lower the rack, and such systems began to be manufactured and sold commercially, both in Europe and America. Larger, wealthier or commercial properties sometimes had drying cabinets or drying rooms associated with their laundry rooms, in addition to or instead of clothes airers. The cabinets were of wood or cast iron, with a series of drying racks on wheels which were pulled in or out of the cabinet horizontally. The cabinet was heated by coal, gas or wood. The Shaker community still uses these cabinets. Similar drying cabinets exist today, powered by electricity, but are intended for delicate clothing unsuitable for a powered clothes dryer, rather than for general drying. However, although the washing of laundry became mechanised and electrified in the twentieth century, even households that can afford electric clothes driers may also use a clothes airer, and its environmentally friendly qualities have led to a resurgence in its popularity, with a number of new manufacturers springing up in recent decades. Description The airer consists of a rack with several horizontal wooden rails or laths, suspended in two mounts or rack ends which were originally cast iron, but may be other metals or alloys today. The rack ends serve to hold and space the rails, and act as points to secure the cords that raise and lower the unit. Cords go from the metal tether points to pulleys mounted on the ceiling, and then to a cleat hook mounted on the wall. The defining feature of this airer is its pulley system. The airer is lowered to be loaded or unloaded, then raised to move the items up into warmer air and as out of the way of room occupants as the ceiling height allows. A pulley clothes airer is sometimes also described as \\"Victorian\\", \\"Edwardian\\", or \\"Lancashire\\" and then comprises two iron frames positioned as far apart as desired to provide a suitable length, with wooden laths, typically four or six, passed through holes in them. The frames are suspended from the ceiling by a system of rope and pulleys. The result is a hoistable rack with several parallel bars on which clothes can be draped out of the way, or hung, extending further down, with clothes hangers.Typical parts available commercially to assemble a pulley airerImages found by Google image search for \\"pulley airer\\" A modern development uses a wooden frame with seven to eleven continuous clothes lines which increase the capacity of the clothes horse. The frame uses a clam cleat to tighten the clothes lines and hangs on four ropes. This increases the necessary installation effort, but also improves safety by increasing redundancy of the suspension. It uses a pulley system (block and tackle) which reduces the required force to lift the loaded frame.A modern design of the clothes horse See also *Clothes horse *Clothes line *Airing Cupboard *Clothes Dryer *Laundry *Mangle References Category:Laundry drying equipment ","title":"Overhead clothes airer"},{"id":"20126671","text":"1925 LMS Birmingham to Handsworth Wood Third Class Child Railway Ticket Handsworth Wood railway station was a railway station in Handsworth Wood, Birmingham, England, on the London and North Western Railway's rail link between the Chase Line and the West Coast Main Line.

The program began in 1993 under the combined leadership of Dr. Harry Wechsler at George Mason University (GMU) and Dr. Jonathan Phillips at the Army Research Laboratory (ARL) in Adelphi, Maryland and resulted in the development of the Facial Recognition Technology (FERET) database. The goal of the FERET program was to advance the field of face recognition technology by establishing a common database of facial imagery for researchers to use and setting a performance baseline for face-recognition algorithms.P.

Patern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 22(10), Oct. 2000. Potential areas where this face- recognition technology could be used include: * Automated searching of mug books using surveillance photos * Controlling access to restricted facilities or equipment * Checking the credentials of personnel for background and security clearances * Monitoring airports, border crossings, and secure manufacturing facilities for particular individuals * Finding and logging multiple appearances of individuals over time in surveillance videos * Verifying identities at ATM machines * Searching photo ID records for fraud detection The FERET database has been used by more than 460 research groups and is currently managed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).Li, Stan; Jain, Anil, eds. (2011). Handbook of Face Recognition. Springer-Verlag London. pp. 310‚Äì312. . By 2017, the FERET database has been used to train artificial intelligence programs and computer vision algorithms to identify and sort faces.  History  The FERET program first began as a way to unify a large body of face-recognition technology research under a standard database. Before the program‚Äôs inception, most researchers created their own facial imagery database that was attuned to their own specific area of study. These personal databases were small and usually consisted of images from less than 50 individuals. The only notable exceptions were the following: * Alex Pentland‚Äôs database of around 7500 facial images at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) * Joseph Wilder‚Äôs database of around 250 individuals at Rutgers University * Christoph von der Malsburg‚Äôs database of around 100 facial images at the University of Southern California (USC) The lack of a common database made it difficult to compare the results of face recognition studies in the scientific literature because each report involved different assumptions, scoring methods, and images. Most of the papers that were published did not use images from a common database nor followed a standard testing protocol. As a result, researchers were unable to make informed comparisons between the performances of different face-recognition algorithms. In September 1993, the FERET program was spearheaded by Dr. Harry Wechsler and Dr. Jonathan Phillips under the sponsorship of the U.S. Department of Defense Counterdrug Technology Development Program. = Phase I = The first facial images for the FERET database were collected from August 1993 to December 1994, a time period known as Phase I. The pictures were initially taken with a 35-mm camera at both GMU and ARL facilities, and the same physical setup was used in each photography session to keep the images consistent. For each individual, the pictures were taken in sets, including two frontal views, a right and left profile, a right and left quarter profile, a right and left half profile, and sometimes at five extra locations. Therefore, a set of images consisted of 5 to 11 images per person. At the end of Phase I, the FERET database had collected 673 sets of images, resulting in over 5000 total images. At the end of Phase I, five organizations were given the opportunity to test their face-recognition algorithm on the newly-created FERET database in order to compare how they performed against each other. There five principal investigators were: * MIT, led by Alex Pentland * Rutgers University, led by Joseph Wilder * The Analytic Science Company (TASC), led by Gale Gordon * The University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaigne, led by Lewis Sadler and Thomas Huang * USC, led by Christoph von der Malsburg During this evaluation, three different automatic tests were given to the principal investigators without human intervention: # The large gallery test, which served to baseline how algorithms performed against a database when it has not been properly tuned. # The false-alarm test, which tested how well the algorithm monitored an airport for suspected terrorists. # The rotation test, which measured how well the algorithm performed when the images of an individual in the gallery had different poses compared to those in the probe set. For most of the test trials, the algorithms developed by USC and MIT managed to outperform the other three algorithms for the Phase I evaluation. = Phase II = Phase II began after Phase I, and during this time, the FERET database acquired more sets of facial images. By the start of the Phase II evaluation in March 1995, the database contained 1109 sets of images for a total of 8525 images of 884 individuals. During the second evaluation, the same algorithms from the Phase I evaluation were given a single test. However, the database now contained significantly more duplicate images (463, compared to the previous 60), making the test more challenging. = Phase III = Afterwards, the FERET program entered Phase III where another 456 sets of facial images were added to the database. The Phase III evaluation, which took place on September 1996, aimed to not only gauge the progress of the algorithms since the Phase I assessment but also identify the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm and determine future objectives for research. By the end of 1996, the FERET database had accumulated a total of 14,126 facial images pertaining to 1199 different individuals as well as 365 duplicate sets of images. As a result of the FERET program, researchers were able to establish a common baseline for comparing different face-recognition algorithms and create a large standard database of facial images that is open for research. In 2003, DARPA released a high- resolution, 24-bit color version of the images in the FERET database (existing reference).

He coached the American track athletes at the Summer Olympics in 1900, 1908, and 1912. He spent a year in approximately 1884 as the trainer of heavyweight boxing champion John L. Sullivan. The Washington Post in 1913 called Murphy \\"the father of American track athletics.\\" He was considered the premier athletic trainer of his era and was said to have \\"revolutionized the methods of training athletes and reduced it to a science.\\" He is credited with establishing many innovative techniques for track and field, including the crouching start for sprinters. Early years Accounts concerning Murphy's youth differ. He was born in February 1860 either in Southboro, Westboro or Natick, Massachusetts. He was the son of Irish immigrants, a man \\"of humble birth and scant education.\\" Murphy's father had a reputation as an athlete, and Murphy's desire as a youth was to become a great athlete. He has been variously reported to have traveled the country participating in \\"six-day races\\" at the age of 20 and to have been a boxer and a minor league baseball player. Some accounts state that he was part of the world's champion Natick Hook and Ladder racing team of the early 1880s with Keene Fitzpatrick, Steve Farrell, Pooch Donovan, Piper Donovan, Johnny Mack and Sid Peet. According to his obituary in The Philadelphia Inquirer, \\"his ambition was to stand out prominently as a six-day pedestrian and at the age of eighteen he was out in the world trying to win fame and fortune on the tan bark track.\\" Then, \\"after several years of grueling running indoors without anything but glory, Murphy branched out as a sprinter and baseball player.\\" At least one published report states that Murphy \\"was himself one of the greatest professional sprinters this country ever saw.\\" Other accounts indicate that he never achieved great success as an athlete. A friend of Murphy, Pat Hurley, recalled that Murphy's days as a trainer began when Mike Finn, the fleetest professional sprinter in New England, received a letter from New Haven asking him to act as a trainer there. Finn reportedly joked to a group of athletes, \\"Let's send 'Stocky' Murphy.\\" Because Murphy was not a champion among them, Finn's comments brought a \\"round of jeers.\\" But Finn continued, \\"Never mind that, that fellow has a head on him that will get him more some day than our legs will.\\" A Philadelphia sports writer later noted the \\"irony of fate\\" that Murphy had the talent to develop athletic prodigies though \\"nature did not deign to bless him with even an average physique.\\" That writer described Murphy when the first met in 1895 as \\"a small, spare, even delicate-looking man, dressed in a plain suit.\\" Detroit Athletic Club As Yale gained supremacy in athletics, Murphy's fame spread, and in the fall of 1889, the Detroit Athletic Club hired him as the physical director and athletic coach for its members. Murphy remained in Detroit for three years, and while there, he developed a reputation for having a \\"sixth sense\\" in being able to spot athletic talent. His first discovery in Detroit was John Owen who went on to become the fastest sprinter in America. One newspaper account described Murphy's discovery of Owen as follows: > John Owen, a member of the club, was playing tennis one afternoon when > Murphy, in his methodical way, leaned over to watch the movements of the > players. The action of Owen looked promising to Murphy. \\"Mr. Owen, why don't > you be a sprinter?\\" he asked while the players were wiping off perspiration > between acts. \\"I?\\" returned Owen. \\"Why, I couldn't run a lick.\\" But Murphy > insisted, and from that seeming guess work selection of a future great was > developed John Owen, the first amateur sprinter to cover one hundred yards > under ten seconds. Owen's time was 9-4/5 seconds. After Owen set the world's record of 9-4/5 seconds in the 100-yard dash, Owen focused his efforts on the 220- and 440-yard events. Murphy told the press in 1891 that he was \\"confident that Owen will be able to create new records for both these distances next summer.\\" While in Detroit, Murphy also discovered Harry M. Jewett, Owen's successor as America's greatest sprinter. He also coached the father of 1912 sprinting gold medalist, Ralph Craig. When Murphy became ill in 1913, the Detroit Athletic Club presented Murphy with a touring car in gratitude for his service. Father of American track athletics =Fifteen intercollegiate championships with 21 teams= In 1892, Murphy returned to Yale where he served as coach and trainer of the track team and trainer of the football team. Over the next 11 years, Murphy moved back-and- forth between Yale (1892‚Äì1896, 1901‚Äì1905) and the University of Pennsylvania (1896‚Äì1901, 1905‚Äì1913). After turning Yale into the dominant power in track and field, Murphy brought immediate success to Penn when he moved there in 1896. In his first season at Penn, the school captured the intercollegiate track championship, scoring 34 points to defeat Yale, and finished with 24.5 points. Of the 21 indoor and outdoor track teams coached by Murphy during this time, 15 of them won the intercollegiate championships‚Äîeight at Penn and seven at Yale. And on the six occasions when his teams did not finish first, they finished second on four occasions and third and fourth once each. Wherever Murphy went as a coach he put in place a solid back-up team of assistant coaches and rubbers. Over the years these included George Orton, Mike Dee and Jimmy Curran. Many went on to achieve great success coaching college and high school athletics. For his contributions during these years, The Washington Post in 1913 called Murphy \\"the father of American track athletics.\\" He was considered \\"the greatest coach of track men and trainer of men in other branches of sport that America had ever known.\\" =Champions trained by Murphy= In addition to his success in coaching the Yale and Penn teams to championships, Murphy also developed an unparalleled reputation for finding and training individual champions. Between 1892 and 1900, he reportedly developed nearly every American track champion: > America owes to none other than \\"Mike\\" Murphy her winning of the supremacy > of track athletics from England, who, twenty years ago, was considered > unbeatable on the cinder path. In the eight years intervening between 1892 > and 1900, the period in which America made her most gigantic strides in > track athletics, \\"Mike\\" Murphy developed every champion of the spiked shoe > in America except Hollister, of Harvard, and it was these champions > developed by him that first put America on the map of the athletic world. As of 1908, athletes coached by Murphy held 8 of the 14 recognized intercollegiate track and field records, and had also held the records in the pole vault and shot put until 1907. In addition to his discovery of Owen in Detroit, Murphy's discovery of Maxie Long is another oft-cited example of Murphy's ability to recognize and develop raw talent. Long, who became the country's top quarter-miler, was a bicycle rider when Murphy discovered him. Murphy coaxed him into sprinting, and on seeing Long run his first spring, Murphy reportedly declared, \\"I have discovered a champion.\\" Alvin Kraenzlein was another talent developed by Murphy. When Kraenzlein began training with Murphy, he was a hurdler, but not a sprinter. Murphy trained Kraenzlein as a sprinter, and he became a champion the 100-yard dash and won an Olympic gold medal in the 60-yard dash. =Olympics= Starting in 1890, Murphy also spent 11 consecutive summers coaching many of the country's top athletes at the New York Athletic Club's summer facilities on Travers Island. having led the American athletes to successes in international competitions during the 1890s, Murphy was selected as the coach and trainer of the American teams at the Olympics in 1900, 1908, and 1912. 1900 games in Paris At the 1900 Summer Olympics in Paris, there was no official American team, and several universities sent athletes and coaches to represent the United States. Murphy took 13 Penn athletes and others from the New York Athletic Club to Paris. The U.S. athletes won 16 of the 23 gold medals in track and field, and the Penn Olympians won 11 gold medals, 8 silver and 4 bronze. Murphy's student, Alvin Kraenzlein won four individual gold medals in the 60-meter dash, 110-meter hurdles, 200-meter hurdles, and long jump. 1908 games in London At the 1908 Summer Olympics in London, Murphy was placed in charge of the entire American team, not just his own Penn athletes. On the trip across the Atlantic Ocean, Murphy was always jovial, leading the men in light exercise in which the athletes were \\"made to feel that it was merely play.\\" Murphy was \\"the life of the team,\\" keeping the men busy \\"having fun all the time.\\" On arriving in London, Murphy concluded that \\"the awful London fog and rain\\" and the crowd of athletes training at the same hours in the stadium was not ideal. Accordingly, Murphy demanded that the American team be moved to Brighton, England, where there was a \\"better chance to see the sun.\\" When the team manager demurred about the expense of a move, Murphy insisted that the team would go to Brighton \\"if I have to pay their way.\\" The American team dominated the track and field competition in London, winning 16 gold medals, with all other countries combined winning the remaining 11 gold medals. After the American victory in London, newspapers credited Murphy as the man behind the dominance of American track and field athletes. One newspaper account reported: > In an effort to find a reason for the great superiority of American > athletes, English sportsmen have finally concluded that this superiority is > entirely due to the high development to which the Yankees have brought the > science of training. This is better than to acknowledge that the manhood of > Great Britain has deteriorated. The American athletes explain it by simply > saying \\"Mike Murphy,\\" for Mike is the kingpin of the profession, and every > trainer in American follows as closely as he can the methods of the man who > has developed more champions than any other man in the world. When the American team returned from London, President Theodore Roosevelt hosted them at his Sagamore Hill home on Long Island, and singled out Murphy for special recognition. As U.S. Olympic Committee Chairman James Sullivan introduced Murphy to the President, Roosevelt interrupted: \\"We don't have to be introduced. I am might glad to see you. He is an American institution; and we are all glad to meet Mike.\\" Upon their return, the American team also presented Murphy with a silver loving cup in gratitude for his efforts. 1912 games in Stockholm By the time of the 1912 Summer Olympics in Stockholm, Murphy was already ill with tuberculosis, and his illness was reported to have \\"thrown a scare into those interested in the welfare of the American track and field team.\\" He was nevertheless selected as the coach of the American team and accompanied the team to Stockholm with assistance from Lawson Robertson. It was reported that the long trip had an adverse effect on his health, and he died less than a year later. In Stockholm, the Americans again dominated the track and field competition, winning 16 of 32 possible gold medals, and 42 of 94 total medals. Murphy received principal credit for the dominance of American athletes between the 1890s and the Stockholm Olympics. The praise for Murphy was so great that a backlash developed among westerners who felt that, though many of the country's greatest athletes were coming out of the Midwest, the Eastern establishment sought to heap all of the credit on Murphy. For example, during the 1912 Olympics, the Minneapolis Journal noted that Murphy was not responsible for developing Midwestern stars Jim Thorpe and Ralph Craig and wrote: > They are still at it down East, attempting to grab off the glory for the > splendid work of the American athletes in the Olympic games as the personal > due of Mike Murphy. ... Mike Murphy is unquestionably a great trainer, but > he falls far short of deserving all the credit for the winning of the > Olympic games. ... It is an injustice to other less-famed trainers to have > their products blandly attributed to Murphy as some of the eastern writers, > with their usual provincial complacency, are doing. Murphy is big enough and > well enough known by past performances as a trainer to stand upon his own > merits without having his misguided friends attempt to seize for him leaves > of a bay rightfully belonging to other men. =Innovative techniques= He was considered the premier athletic trainer of his era and was said to have \\"revolutionized the methods of training athletes and reduced it to a science.\\" He is credited with establishing many innovative techniques for track and field, including the crouching start for sprinters. He is also credited with being the first man to develop the practice of strapping the tendon with adhesive tape or rubber bandages before competition, and with innovating the use of a mixture of liniment or rubbing oil in treating his athletes. Murphy also preached the need for a pure mind and body and abolished the old attitude that athletes in training for a physical test required ale and certain stimulants \\"to give them the vim and make them 'go.'\\" He also became known for his advocacy of not over-working an athlete during training. In 1895, one of his athletes, Sweeney, set a world record in the high jump. Murphy rested Sweeney for three days before the International Games against England, and Sweeney spent most of his time in bed. When Sweeney arrived at the field on the day of the competition, \\"he was so full of ginger he could hardly stand still\\" and set a world record. Another writer emphasized Murphy's recognition in his training regimen that an athlete is a human: > He is the originator of the now generally accepted belief that an athlete is > a human. Under his system the old idea of athletes being steamed and worked > like mules was banished. Training with weighted shoes or running uphill in > rubber boots were old methods that were put into the discard. Light shoes > for racing and heavier ones for workout are enough. He also authored two books on track coaching and techniques, Training and College Athletics. =Relationship with athletes= Murphy was reportedly beloved by the athletes he trained and instilled tremendous loyalty in them. It was reported during Murphy's lifetime that there was \\"not a man who ever trained under Mike Murphy who wouldn't go to the end of the world for the veteran trainer if he desired it.\\" He reportedly had \\"some peculiar means of persuasion and development that makes men win.\\" Murphy's \\"first object was always to get the confidence of a student, which soon developed into a love for the man and his work.\\" The chair of Penn's physical education department once described Murphy's motivational approach as follows: > Mike is a combination of a professor of applied psychology and an > evangelist. He possesses the quality peculiar to evangelists of first > hypnotizing himself, so great an aid in obtaining control of those to whom > he appeals. Examples of Murphy's close relationships with athletes were many. In 1905, when Murphy left Yale for the second and final time, some reports indicated it was due to an aristocratic slight to the captain of the football team, Shevlin. Despite a custom at Yale of electing the captain to the elite upper class clubs, Shevlin was not elected because of his lack of social prestige. Murphy was reportedly \\"disgusted with the growth of aristocratic as opposed to democratic sentiments\\" at New Haven and did not care to remain there. Others suggested that the real reason for Murphy's move to Penn had more to do with the question of salary, as Penn agreed to pay Murphy a salary of $10,000 per year‚Äîmore than double the salary then paid to a U.S. Senator. Illustration of Murphy with Dartmouth's Steve Chase pleading for pie Another popular Murphy story involved Stephen Chase, a leading sprinter from Dartmouth. Chase was sent to work with Murphy at Travers Island in 1895 in preparation for the International Games with England's best athletes. At the evening meal, Chase was disappointed to discover that pie was not to be served at the camp, packed his bags, and placed them on a bus headed to the train station. Realizing that the consumption of pie was part of the training regimen that led Chase to set a world record, Murphy ran to the kitchen, got a large cut of apple pie, and ran down the roadway with \\"a piece of pie deftly balanced on a plate, all the time calling, 'Here it is Chase. I got it for you.'\\" According to the story, Chase came back \\"and was a world beater, and on pie, too.\\" Murphy was also called the \\"probably the most picturesque figure in American athletics\\" and was said to be a \\"splendid story teller\\" who delighted his athletes with stories over an open fire or on the training field, telling of his many adventures, including his travels through Canadian lumber camps searching for the next John L. Sullivan. He was reportedly also a lover of chess and literature, especially the works of Honor√© de Balzac. Deafness Murphy's accomplishments are all the more remarkable as he was deaf. He was known as \\"Silent Mike\\" due to his affliction, and contemporary reports state that, though he was deaf, the affliction was not so severe as to prevent him from hearing all remarks. One report in 1905 noted: \\"It was characteristic of Murphy to encourage the belief that he was very deaf and thus break down the caution of the lads who prided themselves on their ability to outwit the veteran.\\" In 1908, The Washington Post noted that, though Murphy had been \\"rather deaf\\" for several years, his deafness had worsened, such that anyone wanting to speak with him \\"has to shout at the top of his lungs.\\" Murphy joked at the time, \\"I'm not much of a one to tell secrets to.\\" When he was in Reno in 1910 for the Jack Johnson‚ÄìJames Jeffries fight, Murphy recalled being approached by a woman who went on at length telling him about her marital problems. After she finished, Murphy told her, \\"Madame, you have come to the right person. Your secrets are safe. I have not heard a word you said.\\" Murphy suggested that his deafness made him more sympathetic to others and contributed to his success as a handler of men. College football Murphy also served as the trainer for the Yale and Penn football teams from 1892‚Äì1912, and was an integral part of the football program during an era when Yale and Penn were among the top programs in the country. After Murphy's death, a Philadelphia sports editor wrote about Murphy's ability to inspire a football team to superhuman efforts: > He could arouse a team to superhuman efforts as no trainer ever did or > perhaps ever will do. He had an oratory peculiarly his own. It was > sympathetic, winning, insistent, pleading, the acme of exhortation. The > writer once saw him move a red and blue football team to tears between the > halves of a great intercollegiate battle when they retired to their dressing > room with the score against them and there appeared no reasonable > probability of vanquishing their foes. ... The wonderfully magnetic and > persuasive powers of the dead trainer were exerted to their utmost ... > Murphy's appeal to the Penn players was a masterpiece of its kind. It fired > the hearts of that disheartened, discouraged and well-nigh defeated team; it > transformed every man into a fighting Titan, a giant who did not know his > own strength and ability; it moved every man to tears; it converted an > apparent defeat to one of the most glorious triumphs ever witnessed in the > records of old Penn's athletic history. Murphy was football head coach for the University of Michigan in 1891. He later became the first football coach at Villanova University in 1894 where he initiated their program. Between 1906 and 1908, a movement developed to eliminate football from university sports programs on grounds that it was too brutal and was attracting professionalism to the college campuses. However, Murphy remained a strong supporter of college football. In 1908, he told The Washington Post: > Fellows, show me a man that has gone to college for four years and played on > either his varsity or scrub football team and I'll show you a man that'll > make good on any job he tackles when he gets out into the world. However, Murphy was an opponent of brutality and insisted on fair play among his football players. In 1907, when he witnessed one of Penn's players \\"slug a man,\\" an angry Murphy rushed out on the field and made the offending player leave the field, and required him to apologize before he would be allowed to play football again for Penn. In 1909, Murphy published a column deploring the ongoing agitation against college football. He responded to charges that it was a brutal sport as follows: \\"I am not disposed to deny that football is a rough game. But when cleanly played as it is in our big colleges, and when properly safeguarded the element of danger is almost entirely eliminated.\\" In response to proposals to replace football in American universities with either soccer or Canadian rugby, Murphy expressed disdain: \\"Both of these are jokes when compared to the American game. They lack the science of our football and certainly would not prove very interesting to the spectators.\\" Murphy spoke in favor of removing restrictions on the forward pass, which he viewed as a spectacular play and one that weakens the defense. His main suggestions for eliminating injuries were to abolish the diving tackle, develop better padding, and eliminate the kickoff. With respect to the kickoff, Murphy noted: \\"I have always felt that it was in the crash of the two teams that most accidents occurred.\\" =Head coaching record= Family and death Murphy and his wife, Nora Long, had three children. One of their children, George Murphy, became a well-known movie actor in the 1940s and 1950s and then a U.S. senator from California from 1965 to 1971. Their other son, Charles Thorne Murphy, was a football player at Yale before settling in Detroit. In June 1913, Murphy died at his home at 4331 Chestnut Street in Philadelphia after a prolonged illness. He reportedly lapsed into unconsciousness after the 1913 Penn track team gathered at his bedside to tell him they had won the 1913 intercollegiate championship. According to some reports, Murphy's illness began when Michigan and Penn played a football game in a blizzard at Ann Arbor, Michigan. From that time on, Murphy was \\"a sick man, suffering from tuberculosis.\\" Upon his death, the flags at the University of Pennsylvania were lowered to half mast and The Philadelphia Inquirer proclaimed, \\"Mike Murphy is dead‚ÄîLong live 'Mike' Murphy.\\" The sports editor of the Philadelphia Public Ledger wrote: > Michael Charles Murphy will never be forgotten. Long after the generations > who loved him personally ... have passed away, his name will be written > indelibly in the most glorious annals of American's track and field history. > His name and fame can never die. He will ever stand as the track wizard of > his age, the hero of coaching achievements of his time. The funeral was held at St. James Catholic Church at 38th and Chestnut Streets in Philadelphia with many of track's greatest athletes serving as his pallbearers. In 1941, the University of Pennsylvania dedicated Murphy Field House as a tribute to Murphy; the Murphy Field House was destroyed by fire in 1968.

The site contains remains dating from the Neolithic to the Middle Ages‚Äîa period of some 3,000 years‚Äîand the Bronze Age and Anglo-Saxon features are particularly notable.Hamerow, H. 1993 Excavations at Mucking, Volume 2: The Anglo-Saxon Settlement (English Heritage Archaeological Report 21) Major excavations took place at the site between 1965 and 1978, directed by Margaret Ursula Jones. Covering an area of 18 hectares (44 acres), at the time it was the largest archaeological excavation in Europe, and is the largest excavation ever undertaken in the British Isles. Excavation continued year-round to stay ahead of gravel extraction that was rapidly destroying the site, accumulating an \\"astonishing\\" volume of material. Only a fraction of this was analysed or published in Jones' lifetime, and ultimately the bulk of the post-excavation work was left to others. The first volume of a \\"full publication\\" was not published until 2015, by which point the post-excavation phase had cost significantly more than the initial excavation. This led some to criticise Mucking as an irresponsible, \\"excavation without publication\\". Location and discovery The site was on the gravel terrace, close to the north bank of the Thames, and was owned by Surridge Disposals Ltd. There were a number of other Saxon settlements in the vicinity - see list of archaeological sites in Thurrock. The site was discovered as a result of aerial photographs showing cropmarks and soil marks. The earliest photographs to reveal the site were taken by the Luftwaffe in 1943.Clark, A. 1993. Excavations at Mucking, Volume 1: The Site Atlas (English Heritage Archaeological Report 20) However, these were not readily available to archaeologists. The importance of the site was recognised following photographs taken by Dr JK St. Joseph of Cambridge University on 16 June 1959, although these photos were not published until 1964.The tenant farmer (T Lindsey) remarked that crop marks for archaeologists were his best crop. Following publication of the crop mark photos, DG Macleod of Prittlewell Museum and DA Whickham, Chief Librarian for Thurrock realized the site was threatened by gravel extraction and instigated the scheduling of the site under the Ancient Monuments Act. An earlier small-scale investigation had been carried out by members of the Thurrock Local History Society, under Ken Barton, on the western side of Buckingham Hill Road, as a result of field walking finds rather than aerial photographs. In late 1965, Margaret Jones was asked to carry out a brief exploratory excavation at a site, then known as Linford, which was slowly being destroyed as a result of gravel digging by Hoveringham Gravels Ltd. Jones' excavations (1965‚Äì1978) Margaret Ursula Jones recording pottery at Mucking. As a result of this exploratory dig, and of the earlier investigations, Jones' contract was extended and she was appointed director of the full scale excavations. She was joined by her husband Tom and in 1965 (after the crops had been harvested)MU Jones, An Ancient Landscape Palimpsest (in Essex Archaeology and History, Volume 5, 1973) they began the mammoth task that was to last for the next 14 years on the Mucking hill top. The excavation was unusual in that it continued through the winter, unlike most excavations which only took place in the summer.Terry Carney, Memories of Mucking (in Thurrock Gold, Thurrock Local History Society, 2002) The need to stay ahead of the gravel extraction sometimes meant softening the frozen ground with a blow torch to enable a find to be lifted in time. The Joneses were assisted by many younger archaeologists and 'volunteers' from Britain and abroad including more than 3,000 students from many countries. The volunteers lived mainly in tents during the warmer months, but in the winter, occupied old caravans and sheds. The organisation of the camp, the feeding, the pay and the volunteers' welfare involved many individuals guided by terse memos signed by the initials 'muj'. Jones sometimes commented that it was more like a holiday camp than an archaeological dig. In the final stages of the dig, volunteers were supplemented by local unemployed people, funded by a government job creation scheme. Without this extra assistance, the excavation might not have been completed. Jones died in 2001. The Independent of 31 March 2001 carried an obituary which said 'for a generation of respectable middle-aged archaeologists ... to have dug with Margaret Jones at Mucking remains a badge of honour'. In her will, she left money to fund fieldwork or research related to the Mucking excavations or for landscape archaeology covering the same periods as Mucking.Society of Antiquaries of London: The Margaret and Tom Jones Fund =Post-excavation and publication= Initial post-excavation analysis took place at the Thurrock Museum and Library from 1978 to 1985. This phase consumed funding of approximately ¬£250,000, compared with ¬£85,000 for the excavations themselves. Post-excavation analysis was hampered by the scale of the excavation and its finds and by the changing expectation of what constituted an excavation archive. It was no longer appropriate to provide a narrative and conclusions by the excavator. Instead, it was required that an excavation archive should provide the data to enable a future complete reinterpretation of the finds and alternative conclusions.Margaret Jones, quoted in The dig was financed by the Inspectorate of Ancient Monuments in the Department of the Environment (a precursor to English Heritage). The dig was criticised in some quarters as \\"excavation without publication\\", but Jones defended the need to excavate everything ahead of the gravel extraction and refused to spend valuable time preparing results for publication. Hamerow acknowledges that small-scale sample excavations would not have revealed important features of the site ‚Äì for example that it was a single settlement, the location of which moved over time rather than separate early and later settlements. Three volumes of excavation results were published by 2009. The Cambridge Archaeological Unit agreed to complete the publication of the excavation reports on the Roman and pre-Roman periods, the first of which was published in December 2015. Initial finance was allocated for this by English Heritage via the Aggregates Levy Sustainability Fund (ALSF).Mucking - Prehistoric and Roman ALSF Project Number 5220 As a result of the delays in preparing for publication, some computer files could not initially be read. More sophisticated data salvage techniques were able to recover more than a million grid references to finds. Results Romano-British or Anglo-Saxon belt fittings from the Anglo-Saxon cemetery at Mucking, 5th century, (British Museum)British Museum Collection Romano-British or Anglo-Saxon belt fittings from Mucking, 5th century, (British Museum). The excavation found more than 44,000 archaeological features. These included isolated graves and pits from the Neolithic and a hill fort from the Bronze Age. There were also more than 100 Iron Age round houses and a Romano-British cemetery. The excavations revealed substantial indications of a high status Romano-British building (that Jones had \\"no doubt\\" was a villa), located either within the excavation or nearby. =The Anglo-Saxon settlement= The site had been abandoned by the Romano-British during the 4th century and there was a gap before the Saxon occupation of the site began in the early 5th century. This was among the earliest Anglo-Saxon settlements in England. The Anglo-Saxon settlement gradually moved north over the course of two hundred years after its establishment.Nigel Brown (compiler), Splendid and Permanent Pageants, Essex County Council, 2000 During or after the 8th century, the settlement was either abandoned, or drifted beyond the area that was excavated. The area previously occupied by the Anglo-Saxon settlement became part of a Saxo-Norman field system. More than 200 Anglo-Saxon sunken featured buildings (Grubenhaus) were excavated, together with nearly a dozen large timber buildings. These more substantial halls were up to long and wide with entrances in the middle of both longer sides. There was some evidence of enclosures that may have been animal pens.Hamerow, Helena Herrenh√∂fe in Anglo-Saxon England =The Anglo- Saxon cemeteries= There were more than 800 burials in the Anglo-Saxon cemeteries ranging in date from the early 5th to the 7th century.Sue Hirst and Dido Clark, Excavations at Mucking: Volume 3, The Anglo-Saxon Cemeteries (Museum of London Archaeology 2009) Two cemeteries were excavated, although one of them had already been partially destroyed by gravel working. Cemetery II contained cremation and inhumation graves, while cemetery I contained only inhumations. Cemetery II (the undamaged cemetery) contained graves from which 125 brooches were recovered, allowing the reconstruction of Anglo-Saxon dress styles. The cemeteries were not used after the middle 7th century although the settlement continued in to the 8th century. Later burials may have been at a Christian cemetery associated with Cedd's minster church at Tilbury. =Finds= In addition to the brooches, other finds from the settlement and cemeteries included 5th century domestic Anglo-Saxon pottery and late Roman military belt fittings in the Quoit Brooch Style. More than 5,000 items were donated to the British Museum by the landowners.See, for example British Museum catalogue Some of the original finds from the excavation are displayed in the British Museum, and others are in storage. Some replica finds are in the Thurrock Museum. Significance While the finds from other periods are of some interest, it is as an Anglo-Saxon site that Mucking is most significant. Unlike Sutton Hoo or the Royal Saxon tomb in Prittlewell, the dig provided significant information about living and working conditions for people below the status of kings or princes. It was the first time an excavation had covered both a Saxon settlement and its associated cemetery. Results from the Mucking excavation have been extensively used in illustrating and debating archaeological issues. For example, before the dig was completed, hand made pottery was illustrated almost entirely by sherds from Mucking in The Archaeology of Anglo-Saxon England by David M. Wilson. Many other authors have used the results. Arnold and Wardle used evidence from Mucking to support the idea that there was a major shift in the location of Anglo-Saxon settlements in the 8th century, from lighter to heavier, but more productive soils. However, RipponStephen Rippon Beyond the Medieval Village (OUP, 2008) argued that the later phases of occupation at Mucking had not been excavated. Similarly, results from Mucking have been used in the debate on the numbers of incoming Anglo-Saxons at the end of the Roman period. For example, HookeDella Hooke, The Landscape of Anglo-Saxon England (Leicester University Press, 1998) and otherse.g. John Baker Cultural Transition in the Chilterns and Essex Region (University of Hertfordshire Press, 2007) have used the quality of soil at Mucking to suggest that incoming Anglo-Saxons were forced by the local inhabitants to settle on the poorest agricultural land. On the other hand, Myres puts forward the view that the site was chosen by the London authorities \\"to provide early warning of strange vessels sailing up the river with hostile intent\\".John Nowell Linton Myres The English settlements (Oxford University Press, 1989, p. 131) The discovery of a \\"Roman style\\" military buckle in an Anglo-Saxon grave at Mucking has been used to argue for continuity between the Roman and Anglo-Saxon settlement.by Francis Pryor and others. Pryor's argument is summarised by Stephen Oppenheimer in The Origins of the British (Constable and Robinson, 2007, page 363) References External links *Mucking - Prehistoric and Roman, Cambridge Archaeological Unit ALSF Project Archive Category:Archaeological sites in Thurrock Category:Anglo-Saxon sites in England Category:Cemeteries in Essex ","title":"Mucking (archaeological site)"},{"id":"20126859","title":"Swimming at the 2007 World Aquatics Championships ‚Äì Men's 1500 metre freestyle"},{"id":"20126867","text":"Hadia Tajik (born 18 July 1983) is a Pakistani-Norwegian jurist, journalist and politician.

She is the first Muslim and Asian member of government, and is a Member of Parliament for the Labour Party representing Oslo. Unlike some of her older predecessors and colleagues, Tajik is an enthusiastic user of social media, and an avid supporter of E-books, and as a result she is often called Norway's \\"first digital Minister of Culture\\".

After completing Bj√∏rheimsbygd Primary School as one of only seven pupils, she attended Tau Lower Secondary School between 1996 and 1998 and later Strand Upper Secondary School from 1998 to 2001. She has a bachelor's degree in journalism from Stavanger University College, after which she studied human rights at Kingston University in England from 2004 to 2005, earning a Masters degree. She subsequently enrolled in and studied law at the University of Oslo receiving her Master of Law degree in 2012. Political career =Early career= Tajik was active in politics from an early age, and was the leader of the Strand chapter of the Workers' Youth League (AUF) from 1999 to 2002, before becoming deputy leader of the Rogaland AUF from until 2003.

Subsequently, from 2008 to 2009, she served as political advisor to the Minister of Justice, Knut Storberget. While serving under Storberget, she was accused of being involved in the so-called hijab-affair. The incident occurred when the Department of Justice withdrew a proposal to allow female police officers to wear the hijab in the service, as a result of fierce uproar. The proposal was authored by Tajik and fellow state secretary Astri Aas-Hansen, and the final decision was allegedly made by them without consulting Storberget. The allegations were never confirmed, but when the Department announced its decision, the media felt the Minister left the impression that the two women were to blame. Later, in 2009, she again served as an advisor for the Minister for Labour and Social Inclusion. = Member of Parliament= On 14 September 2009, Tajik was elected Member of Parliament for the Norwegian Labour Party. Representing Oslo, she was listed as candidate number six on the Labour ticket, which was considered a safe seat. During her tenure in parliament, she was a member of the Standing Committee on Education, Research and Church Affairs as well as the Election committee. She has been nominated in second spot on the Oslo Labour party ballot for the 2013 Norwegian parliamentary election.Vilde Heljesen: Marit Nybakk vant kampvoteringen NRK, 11 November 2012 After the 2013 parliamentary elections and the fall of the Labour-led government, Tajik retained her seat in the Storting from Oslo. She was subsequently named as leader of the Standing Committee on Justice, which is considered one of the most prestigious posts in the Storting. =Minister of Culture= On September 2012, as part of a larger cabinet reshuffle, prime minister Jens Stoltenberg announced that Tajik would become the new Minister of Culture. She replaced Anniken Huitfeldt who became the new Minister of Labour and Social affairs. At the time, she was the youngest ever to become a minister in Norway (at 29), and her appointment made her the first Muslim to serve in the Norwegian cabinet. She is historically the second minister with non-Caucasian ethnic background after Manuela Ramin-Osmundsen, who resigned as Minister of Children, Equality and Social Inclusion in 2008. She resigned in the fall of 2013, along with the rest of the cabinet following the electoral defeat in the 2013 parliamentary elections. =Other= On 22 July 2011, Tajik was visiting the Workers' Youth League summer camp at Ut√∏ya together with former prime minister Gro Harlem Brundtland.

He would later have to emigrate to Holland to escape persecution. John Edward Underhill was born in 1574 at Kenilworth, Warwickshire, England, the son of Thomas Underhill and Magdalen Amyas. He first married Mary Moseley (born 1580) who lived at Wolverhampton, Staffordshire, England. Following her death he married his second wife Leonora Honor Pawley in 1595 at the age of 21. Pawley had been born in 1575 at Uny Lelant, Cornwall, England. Of their three children, two daughters - Petronella and Lettice, are both recorded to have been born in 1593. Their son, the future Captain John Underhill, was born 7 October 1597 in Baginton, Warwickshire, England. John Underhill was a friend and companion to the Earls of Leicester and Essex, and while a youth held a commission in the Earl of Leicester's own Troop of Guards, that was sent to the assistance of the Dutch by Queen Elizabeth I. When the Netherlands offered their sovereignty to the Earl of Leicester, John Edward Underhill was the bearer of confidential dispatches to Lord Burleigh, the Queen's Minister. The Queen sent for Underhill and had a private interview. There she instructed him to deliver a confidential letter to Leicester. Soon afterward the Earl resigned and returned to England. Underhill after the fall and death of Leicester attached himself to the Earl of Essex. He accompanied Essex on a successful attack on Cadiz, Spain, and shared his ill fortune on a campaign against Tyronne and the revolted class in Ireland. For his gallant conduct he was knighted by Elizabeth.Joseph Sulivant, A Genealogy and Family Memorial, 1874 Meanwhile, the Earl of Essex rose in insurrection against the Queen. Essex was subsequently executed and Underhill left for the safety of Holland until the accession of King James in 1603, when he applied for pardon and leave to return to his native country. His request being denied, he remained in The Netherlands a number of years thereafter, in the company of a group of pious Puritans under the Rev. Mr. Robinson who had fled persecution in England. They lived in Bergen op Zoom, a heavily fortified city in The Netherlands. There John Underhill was Sergeant in the Company of Captain Roget Orme. He died there in October 1608 and is buried in the Gertrudiskerk. Of his remaining family members, two are known to have emigrated to America. His wife Lenora Honor Pawley died on 18 December 1658 in Portsmouth, Newport, Rhode Island. And his son Captain John Underhill emigrated with the Puritans to the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1630 and died in Oyster Bay, New York in 1672. Famous descendants Captain John Underhill, great-grandson of Hugh Underhill, would emigrate from England to The Netherlands with his family, and then from The Netherlands to the Massachusetts Bay Colony where he became a leading figure in Colonial America.

Raja Ram). It was collaboratively produced by Raja Ram and Graham Wood of The Infinity Project; St√©phane Holweck, Lo√Øc Van Poucke, and Serge Souque (the founding members of Total Eclipse); and Simon Posford (aka Hallucinogen). The Mystery of the Yeti was an early and influential concept album in psychedelic trance music. Three years after recording it, all the Mystery of the Yeti artists, except for Graham Wood, collaborated on a follow-up album: The Mystery of the Yeti, Part 2 (1999). In 2004, Raja Ram's record label TIP.World Records re-released The Mystery of the Yeti and The Infinity Project's Mystical Experiences (1995) as a double album. Imagery and themes =Narrative= The Mystery of the Yeti is the musical score to a short story written by Raja Ram and trance DJ Chicago (both of whom were later among the members of 1200 Micrograms). The story, called \\"Who or What Is the 'Yeti'?\\", is printed in the liner notes of the album. Each of the album's four tracks conveys a part of the story. Summary of \\"Who or What Is the 'Yeti'?\\" In twelve Himalayan villages, twelve \\"elder mystics\\" each dream that there is a connection between the yeti and extraterrestrial life. With visions to guide them, the elders lead 2000 people from their upland villages higher into the mountains by starlight. At dawn, they sound bejeweled dungchen (long trumpets) to accompany the chants of om by the monks who remain in the villages below. When the echoes recede, the elders sound a gong and merrily continue their journey. The travelers make music as they go. They cross a swiftly-flowing river in canoes, and pass through \\"the tunnel of Dead Spirits\\", where they hear strange voices and other curious sounds. After braving a fierce thunderstorm, they smoke a sacrament, resume their rhythmic music-making, and enter a trance. The music has a mysterious effect on them. The crowd of 2000 simultaneously shouts in joy. Carrying torches, they arrange themselves into a giant mandala. Their focused attention summons a shaman who levitates above them. The shaman, radiating multicolored light, performs an ecstatic dance. Beams and discs of light pass through the people, who suddenly understand the yeti. The light fills their minds with poetry and music. Spontaneously, they awaken to the cosmic consciousness. The shaman shows them the yeti, who is a wise and compassionate extraterrestrial being. The yeti's form changes to an elaborate geometric pattern, and merges with the shaman. In a flash they disappear, replaced with a vessel that can travel through other dimensions of cosmic consciousness. =Album art= The album cover illustrates a scene from the climax of the story \\"Who or What Is the 'Yeti'?\\", and uses various interconnected symbols concerning Shiva, the chakras, and the mind. The paintings are by visionary artists Brahma Templeman and Lahiri. The computer graphics were designed by Barnaby Gorton. On the album cover, a yeti hovers in the lotus position. Glowing emblems in front of his body represent five of the chakra (centers of vital energy): The root chakra, the sacral chakra, the solar plexus chakra, the heart chakra, and the brow chakra (or third eye). His multicolored hair suggests activation of the crown chakra, which symbolizes the higher consciousness that comes with freedom from illusion, or maya. In his right hand he holds a lingam, a stone symbol of Shiva; in his left is a trishula, a symbolic trident with numerous meanings. It represents Shiva's power over the \\"three worlds\\" (trailokya), the \\"three times\\", and the \\"three evils\\". Shiva wields the trishula to destroy trailokya, replacing it with satcitananda, the blissful experience of the universal mind. This triumph occurs in a person's own bodymind through great attainment. Insofar as it pertains to the human body, the trishula refers to the brow chakra as the junction of the three main nƒÅ·∏çi (subtle energy channels). The center prong extends higher because it represents shushmana, an energy channel that continues to the crown chakra. In the album's title, the letter Y in Yeti is actually the Greek capital letter psi (Œ®), which resembles a trishula. The symbol on the monolithic lingam at the base of the mountain is a tripundra, a mark warn on the forehead to indicate a belief that Shiva is the Ishvara, or Supreme Being. The three horizontal lines represent the soul's three bonds: maya, karma, and anava. The lines are drawn with a paste mixed from water and vibhuti (consecrated ash from burnt cow dung), as a reminder that merging with the divine is urgent since the physical body is impermanent. The dot in the center is a bindu. When placed on the forehead, it indicates the third eye. It also symbolizes the unmanifest, from which the cosmos emerges, as well as the point at which the many becomes one.

The station was opened by the Midland Railway on 1 July 1887. It was originally known as Worcester Wharf due to it being located next to the canal, its proximity to which allowed for transshipment with canal barges, the name was changed on 31 May 1892. It initially had facilities to handle 375 wagons, but was expanded gradually over the next fifteen years. It was located in approximately the intended location for the terminal station of the Birmingham West Suburban Railway but which was unable to raise the funds for the planned viaduct over the canal. In 1923 the depot was taken over by the newly amalgamated London, Midland and Scottish Railway, and in 1948 by the nationalised British Railways (later British Rail). From the 1940s onwards, competition from road transport led to a decline in the use of rail freight. In its later years, the depot mostly handled parcels traffic.

The degree meant simply the right to teach, the Licentia docendi, a right which could be granted, in the University of Paris, only by the Chancellor of the Cathedral of Notre Dame, or the Chancellor of St. Genevi√®ve. According to the Third Council of Lateran, held in 1179, this Licentia docendi had to be granted gratuitously, and to all duly qualified applicants.Catholic Encyclopedia If the new member stayed in the university and continued to take an active part in its teaching, he was called a magister regens, a practising teacher. If he were to look for another career, however, he would become non regens: a passive member of the corporation of masters, without losing his affiliation to it, which usually lasted for life. An example of regent master was William Vorilong, French philosopher of the Middle Ages.

It originally aired on November 3, 2008. Plot The day after Stella ran out on their wedding, Ted is unusually happy. His friends are worried about him, thinking that he is repressing his emotions, while Barney is just happy Ted is not married. Over the course of two weeks, the group tries to be there for Ted, but he insists he is fine. Eventually, the group becomes frustrated, and pushes him to unleash his emotions. Though he refuses, he reveals that he has a map of Manhattan with parts covered in red marker pen which he avoids in order to not run into Stella, though this largely confines him. Using the map, they decide to go to dinner at a restaurant recommended by one of Lily's friends. Unfortunately, it soon turns out that friend was actually Stella, who appears at the restaurant while the group is waiting to eat. Panicking, Ted ducks under the table, with the rest of the group reluctantly following his example. Stella places an order to go, so they decide to wait for her to leave. Lily tells Ted he is being stupid, and says he should face Stella. Ted replies that Lily would do the same thing in his position, if \\"Gasser\\" walked in. Lily reveals that in ninth grade, she sat next to a boy named Michael Sasser, who was on the edge of becoming a cool kid. In one lesson, Lily let out a loud fart, and rather than face humiliation, blamed Sasser, giving him the nickname \\"Gasser\\", and he was teased so badly he had to switch schools. Lily says that if Michael were to walk in, she would go over, apologize and face her fear, inviting Ted to do the same. Barney agrees with Lily, saying he has slept with plenty of women he does not want to see again, but he still would not hide from them. Ted mentions Becca DeLucci, a girl Barney used to visit in jail for conjugal visits. On one visit, Barney tried to chat up another inmate, causing a fight to break out. Since then, Barney has received threats from Becca on multiple occasions. Ted decides that everyone wants to hide from someone, and that they should stay under the table until the problem goes away. Robin agrees with Ted, saying she would hide from her father if he were to walk in. Flashbacks show Robin's father (Eric Braeden) was disappointed to have a daughter instead of a son, and raised her as if she were a boy. Things got worse when Robin's father found her kissing one of her hockey teammates when she was 14, leading to an exposition of the hockey equivalent of baseball metaphors for sex, based upon ice hockey. After this, she moved in with her mother. Ted realizes all his friends are haunted by problems in their past but it is not too late for him to face up to his. He decides to talk to Stella, but finds she has already left. They hail a cab and follow her, but Ted still refuses to get angry, and instead wants to talk things out, despite protests from his friends. When they realize Stella is going to Tony's apartment instead of back to New Jersey, he is enraged that she would not move into the city for him, but would for Tony. Finally, Ted unleashes his emotions, and his overjoyed friends cheer him on. Ted imagines himself confronting Stella, telling her she made the wrong choice and should have been with him, as Tony will only let her down again. When he actually goes to talk to her, however, he sees her and Tony with their daughter, and decides that they were meant to be a family, his anger quickly subsiding. Future Ted announces that rather than swallowing your anger, or throwing it in someone's face, the best idea is to simply let it go, so you can move on. Finally, Ted gets rid of his map so he can get on with his life. Critical response Donna Bowman of The A.V. Club gave the episode an A. Michelle Zoromski of IGN rated it 8.5/10.

She was the first woman to vote in Illinois. Ellen Martin graduated the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor law school in 1875 and was admitted to the Illinois bar in 1875 or 1876.Leonard, John William. \\"\\".

On April 6, 1891, in Lombard Illinois, Ellen Martin led a group of 14 prominent women to the voting place at the general store. Although suffrage was restricted to men in Illinois at that time, Lombard was governed by its pre-1870 compact which omitted any mention of gender.http://www.dupagehistory.org/dupage_roots/Lombard_14.htm Miss Martin therefore demanded that the three male election judges allow the women to vote. Reportedly, the voting judges were flabbergasted by Miss Martin: \\"Mr. Marquardt was taken with a spasm, Reber leaned stiff against the wall, and Vance fell backward into the flour barrel.\\" A county judge eventually proclaimed the legitimacy of the women's votes, which became the first women's votes tabulated in Illinois history. Thus, Ellen Martin was the first woman in Illinois to vote. However, the men of Lombard quickly reorganized the town charter in line with the state charter, so that women were only allowed to vote in school elections. By 1916, Illinois women could vote in national elections, and the 19th Amendment (the Women's Suffrage Amendment) was passed in 1920. In 2008 the city of Lombard, Illinois declared April 6 to be \\"Ellen Martin Day\\" in commemoration of Ms. Martin's historic victory for women's suffrage.http://www.lombardhistory.org/ellenmartinday.htm Grave of Ellen Martin, Jamestown, NY Marker commemorating Ellen Martin, located at the Lombard Historical Society References Category:1847 births Category:1916 deaths Category:People from Chautauqua County, New York Category:American suffragists Category:People from Lombard, Illinois Category:University of Michigan Law School alumni Category:Activists from New York (state) ","title":"Ellen A.

His passing and subsequent acquittal of his murderers on the first-degree murder charges provoked public indignation, which eventually led to the end of Pennsylvania's private anti-labor Coal and Iron Police system. History Barcoski immigrated to the United States in 1906. He was married to Sophia Blussick, a fellow Polish emigrant, and had four children, John Jr., Helen, Bertha, and Anthony.John Barcoski, Imperial and Santiago Road; 1920 United States Federal Census Anthony also became a miner and died of lung cancer at age 47.Pennsylvania, Death Certificates, 1906-1967 He was both a farmer and a union employee of the Pittsburgh Coal Company's Montour Mine #9 in McAdams, Pennsylvania. On the evening of the 9th, he went to his mother-in-law's home, and there encountered two private officers also employed by the Pittsburgh Coal Company. Eyewitnesses said one of them launched an unprovoked attack on Barcoski, who received a laceration of the left cheek, five or six head wounds, two broken ribs and a fractured nose. Later at police barracks over the course of four hours, according to trial testimony, a third officer beat Barcoski with a strap while he lay semiconscious on the floor, twisted his ears until the miner cried aloud, and twisted his broken nose until he lapsed again into unconsciousness. Then he beat Barcoski over the chest with a poker until the poker bent, straightened the implement and beat the man again. He stripped the miner to the waist in order to better use a strap and kicked Barcoski until the miner's body rolled over and over on the floor. The original attacker also beat Barcoski, kicked him, struck him over the head with knucklers, and slapped him on the arms, legs and neck with his blackjack. The next morning he was taken to a hospital where he died. A jury acquitted the three officers of murder. Later, two of the police responsible for his death were found guilty of involuntary manslaughter, and his widow was paid $13,500 by the Pittsburgh Coal Company as compensation.

Mulcahy, University of Pittsburgh - Titusville. A Murder at the Police Barracks: The John Barcoski Slaying, 2015 Annual conference of the Appalachian Studies Association Pennsylvania state legislator and former miner Michael Musmanno was outraged by the case, and introduced a bill to banish this private police force. The bill was vetoed by the Republican governor John Stuchell Fisher, which led to Musmanno's resignation.The Italian American Experience: An Encyclopedia. New York: Garland Pub, 2000 Musmanno then published a short story about the case, entitled \\"Jan Volkanik,\\" blending Barcoski's identity with a semi-legendary Polish coal mining figure. Fisher's successor, Gifford Pinchot, fatally crippled the private police forces by refusing to fund them or renew any of their state commissions, and the Coal and Iron Police officially ceased to exist in 1935. That story in turn was basis for the 1935 film Black Fury starring Paul Muni and directed by Michael Curtiz.Herzberg, Bob.

Merrie Melodies animated cartoon directed by Arthur Davis. The short was released on December 6, 1947, and stars Sylvester. Plot An emaciated canary, singing like Frank Sinatra and attracting the attention of all the admiring chicks, is getting on the nerves of a pipe-puffing parrot, who speaks like Bing Crosby. The parrot spots a cat, foraging through the trash. Telling the cat he needs more vitamins (which the canary has been swallowing in bulk), he lures the cat inside to snare the canary. The straightforward approach fails (the canary hits him in the left eye turning it violet). Helped by the parrot's encouragement, he carves a female canary from soap and lures Frankie there; the birds slide down a greased counter, into the sink, and down the drain, but only the soap bird goes through the pipe and down the cat's throat. A trail of birdseed into the garage seems to work, but Frankie jacks the cat's mouth open. The cat laces the vitamins with buckshot, but the magnet attracts everything metal in sight except his prey. The canary turns the cat's vacuum cleaner against him, with a crash in the fireplace giving the cat a hot-stomach; as he buries his head in the sink, the bird adds Foamo-Seltzer to the water; the cat rockets off, crashing into a wall. The cat finally realizes the portly parrot is a better meal; he is later shown sitting on the parrot's perch, imitating his mannerisms.

While playing for the Eagles, Mandarino reportedly attended classes from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.. He would then rushed to the ballpark to practice under the lights with the Eagles, and after the game on Sundays he would again return to his studies. He repeated this routine in 1945, while as an intern. he reportedly earned $200 per game. According to Mandarino, coach Greasy Neale reportedly told him to play tackle after Vic Sears was injured. Neale stated that \\"If you are smart enough to be a doctor, you are smart enough to learn two sets of plays\\".

Dictionary of Ohio Historic Places. Vol. 1. St. Clair Shores: Somerset, 1999, 10-11. The rectangular building, completed in 1926, was designed by Weary & Alford Company, an architectural firm from Chicago. It was the location of the offices of the First National Bank and Trust Company from 1926 until 1974, when the company became a part of Huntington Bank. The structure's twelve stories are faced with Indiana Limestone. Each column of windows is topped with an arch window on the highest floor, and the spandrels between the arch windows are connected to each other. Founded as the \\"Lima Trust Company\\" in 1903, the First National Bank and Trust used a Masonic building in its earliest years. Starting in 1906, it operated in a smaller building (now destroyed), which served as its offices until it moved into its newly erected structure in 1926. During the early twentieth century, the influence of railroads and the oil industry caused Lima to be a very prosperous city. Many large buildings, including two skyscrapers, were built in the city's downtown; the majority of these new structures employed the Chicago Style of architecture. With the decline of the city's economy later in the century, the construction of large buildings in central Lima ceased ‚Äî virtually all new construction took place in the city's outskirts or suburbs ‚Äî thus making the First National Bank and Trust one of the newest major buildings in downtown Lima.Hopkins, Phyllis G. '. National Park Service, 1980-05-15. Accessed 2010-04-28. In recognition of its historic significance, the First National Bank and Trust was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. It was one of seventeen Lima buildings that was added to the National Register as part of the \\"Lima Multiple Resource Area,\\" a Multiple Property Submission that concentrated on architecturally significant buildings in or near downtown Lima. Aside from its importance as a historic site, the First National Bank and Trust Building plays a leading part in local ornithology: the building is a nesting site for peregrine falcons and is part of the Midwest Peregrine Falcon Restoration Project.

It was one of the first GH secretagogues developed and is largely a modified polypeptide, but it is nevertheless orally-active in vivo.

However actual clinical effects in adults with growth hormone deficiency were limited, with only the most severely GH-deficient patients showing significant benefit, and tabimorelin was also found to act as a CYP3A4 inhibitor which could cause it to have undesirable interactions with other drugs.

Geographic distribution  Mokshas live mostly in the central and western parts of the Republic of Mordovia, and neighbouring areas of Tambov Oblast and in the western and central parts of Penza Oblast. Populations of Mokshas also live in Orenburg Oblast, Bashkortostan, Tatarstan, Altai Krai, as well as in diaspora communities in Estonia, Kazakhstan, the United States, and Australia. Culture Moksha women in traditional clothes =Language= Mokshas speak the Moksha language, which is a member of the Mordvinic branch of the Uralic languages. =Mythology= In traditional Mokshan mythology the world was created by I≈Ñe Narmon (Great Bird), referred to in folklore as Ak≈°a Loksti (White Swan). The first thing I≈Ñe Narmon created was water. Yak≈õarga (Duck) brought sand from the bottom of the sea and I≈Ñe Narmon took the sand and with it formed the earth with I≈Ñe ≈†ufta (The Great Tree) on it. I≈Ñe Narmon made its nest on I≈Ñe ≈†ufta, which is usually referred to as Kelu (birch) in folklore. Ak≈°a Kal (White Sturgeon) carried the earth with the roots of I≈Ñe ≈†ufta on its back. I≈Ñe Narmon had three nestlings: Tsofks (Nightingale), Kuku (Cuckoo), and O≈æarga (Skylark). Tsofks chose bushes and willows for his home, Kuku settled in the forest, and O≈æarga went to the meadows. Another of the old deities mentioned in Mokshan folklore was Me≈°avane (Mother Bee). Since the Christianization of the Mokshans the Mokshan Supreme God has usually been called V√§rden ≈†kai (Supreme Creator). According to later legends the creation of the world went through several stages: first the Idemevs (Devil) was asked by the God to bring sand from the bottom of the great sea. Idemevs hid some sand in his mouth. When V√§rden ≈†kai started creating the earth, this hidden sand started to grow in the mouth of Idemevs. He had to spit it out and thus chasms and mountains appeared on the previously level and beautiful earth. The first humans created by V√§rden ≈†kai could live for 700‚Äì800 years and were giants 99 arshins (yards) tall. The underworld in Mokshan mythology was ruled by Mastoratia. The souls of heroes, clan elders and warriors slain in battle travelled after death to the emerald green isle of Usiya, where they sat at a long table together with the great King ≈§u≈°≈•en drinking pure mead.

He played for Plymouth Argyle and Gillingham between 1965 and 1973, before his career was cut short by injury. Career Bickle was born in Plymouth but began his footballing career playing semi- professionally for St Austell of the South Western Football League while working as a milkman. Playing as a striker, he gained a reputation as a highly prolific goalscorer, attracting the attention of professional clubs, and in December 1965, at the age of nearly 22, turned professional with his hometown team, Plymouth Argyle, then of the Football League Second Division. He adjusted quickly to the higher level of football and scored 9 goals in just 17 games in his first season. He went on to be the club's top goalscorer for the following four consecutive seasons, and in total scored 71 goals in 179 league matches, but was unable to save the club from relegation to the Football League Third Division in the 1967‚Äì68 season. In November 1971 Gillingham manager Andy Nelson, who had played alongside Bickle at Home Park, signed him for the Kent-based club, after weeks of press speculation, for a fee of around ¬£7,000. Bickle's arrival at Priestfield Stadium saw him replacing Tommy Watson in a team struggling after relegation to the Football League Fourth Division, and he began his Gillingham career strongly, with two goals in his first five matches. He finished the 1971‚Äì72 season with seven goals to his name, making him the team's third-highest scorer. Just six matches into the following season, however, he suffered a neck injury in a match against Stockport County which kept him out of action for over two months. He made his comeback against Reading in the FA Cup in November 1972, but injured his shoulder during his comeback match and never played for the team again. In January 1973 he accepted the advice of a medical specialist and retired from the sport. He returned to his native West Country but there is no record of him having any further involvement in football.

On March 30, 2016, Ruwe signed a book contract with the Oklahoma-based Tate Publishing and Enterprises, LCC for his novel \\"Crown Jewels.\\" The deal includes Ruwe's future fiction and nonfiction works. Writings and Education As well as his radio and television journalism, Ruwe has written for newspapers and has authored books. Using research methods used in journalism, Ruwe has written three novels \\"Dyeing of Colors\\", \\"Alluvial Reflections\\", \\"Pearly Gates\\", and his fourth entitled \\"Crown Jewels\\" which is due to be published soon. His first novel \\"Dyeing of Colors\\" was published in 2003. His second novel, \\"Alluvial Reflections\\", published in 2004, is Ruwe's attempt at thriller. In 2004, Ruwe went on Leave of Absence from Suffolk University to write his third novel \\"Pearly Gates\\", published in 2007. In the novel, the jury finds Fisha Bayu guilty and sends him to death row. Ruwe's latest novel \\"Crown Jewels\\" is a sequel in which Fisha Bayu takes Queen Elizabeth II to court for colonialism. Ruwe holds a doctorate degree in Education from Northeastern University, Boston, Massachusetts. He was trained as a broadcaster by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) and was educated at the New England Institute of Art and Communications, Suffolk University, Boston, Massachusetts, California State University, Fresno, Fresno Pacific University, Fresno, and Northeastern University, Boston, Massachusetts. He earned a Bachelor of Arts Degree in Mass Communication and Journalism with a major in Broadcast Journalism and a Master's Degree in History. He is a member of the Alpha Delta Pi Society and the Phi Alpha Theta an American honor society for undergraduate and graduates students and professors of history. At California State University, Fresno, he was conferred membership in Kappa Tau Alpha's National Honor Society in Journalism and Mass Communication. In 2006, Ruwe became a member of the Golden Key International Honour Society an organisation that recognizes college students solely on the basis of their academic achievements. Well known honorary members include US President Bill Clinton, General Colin Powell, Astronaut John Glenn and Archbishop Desmond Tutu. Early life Ruwe was born in Wusakili Hospital, Kitwe, Zambia, the son of Jeremiah Aaron Ruwe and Rachel Mbizi. He attended Maiteneke Primary School in Chingola. In 1968, he was moved to Chingola Primary School an all-white school. In 1969 he attended high school at Chikola Secondary School, Chingola, and later at Matero Boys' Secondary School in Lusaka where he repeated form V. He was a member of the Chikola Debate Club and the Boys' Brigade. He sang in the Chiwempala Church Choir and the St. Marks Church Choir. Career In 1975, he entered broadcasting as a Program Operator for Zambia Broadcasting Services, recording radio programs. The following year, Ruwe devised a television sketch show called Tiyende Pamodzi Comedy Show, based on the BBC format of The Two Ronnies, a comedy show aired on Television Zambia in the early seventies, featuring the double act of Ronnie Barker and Ronnie Corbett. Ruwe's first time to host a radio show was in 1977 when he took over the presentation of \\"Sanyo Hit Parade\\" from Humphrey Mapoma. Known by the listeners as \\"Captain of the Air,\\" Ruwe featured an eclectic selection of whatever sort of music struck his fancy. He began to get deluged with mail from listeners who asked him to play their favorite songs. So, Ruwe ventured into commercial radio production, getting sponsorship from various companies around the country. In 1978, Ruwe resigned from ZBS and later moved to Nairobi, Kenya, where he produced a comedy show on the Voice of Kenya television entitled \\"Come What May,\\" featuring himself as the disastrous-prone 'Dafurao.' The program was a sketch show crossed with a sitcom. It also included a duo of him and Rashpal Panesar reading a spoof of news. It is believed that Ruwe was the first to introduce locally produced English comedy on the Voice of Kenya. Ruwe also performed radio continuity duties, narrated various scripted programs and compiled/presented \\"Jazz Hour\\" on the Voice of Kenya. BBC Club Ruwe returned to Zambia in 1982. In the same year, he was sponsored by The British Council to study television production at the BBC Open University in Milton Keynes, England and became a member of the BBC Club. Private sector Upon completion of the course, he returned home and in 1983 teamed up with Zambia's prolific actress Mathilda Malamamfumu Tutu to form Rutu Advertising Agency. Their immediate hit was \\"Secretary of the Year\\" contest, which was launched in August 1984. The contest featured top-flight secretaries drawn from different parts of the country and drew interest from the private sector and parastatal organizations including the Bank of Zambia. In 1985, Ruwe and his partner acquired copies of the movie Love Brewed in an African Pot directed by Ghanaian film maker Akwa Ansah which they showed around the country. In the same year, Ruwe wrote his first book, Have A Good Laugh, a compilation of jokes from different parts of the world. In 1986, Ruwe and Tutu split. Rutu became Rute Advertising ('te' drawn from his daughter Thembinkosi). Between 1986 and 1990 Ruwe scripted and hosted various radio and television programs which included \\"Money Matters\\" by the Bank of Zambia, \\"The Road\\" a production of the National Roads Board and the World Bank, \\"Zamseed Radio Program\\" by Zambia Seed Company, \\"DBZ of the Air\\" by the Development Bank of Zambia, and more than twenty companies under the auspices of INDECO group of companies. Television programs included \\"The Tourist\\" by Zambia National Tourist Board, and various sponsored musicals. During the first Zambia Annual Broadcasting Awards Ceremony, held in Lusaka on 29 December 1989, Ruwe was presented \\"The Best Disc Jockey of the Year\\" for all radio channels award, thereby being recognized as the best radio DJ in the country. From 1990 to 1995, Ruwe operated his own car hire (Rute Car Hire) firm with a fleet of eleven cars and one bus. Ruwe was also known to feature at state functions, dinners and weddings as Master of Ceremonies (ringmaster), often bringing humor and fun to the occasion. Current life In 2006, Ruwe hosted a radio program called The World at Large, on Valley Public Radio, KVPR FM89.3 Fresno and KPRX FM89.1 Bakersfield, California. The program served as a vehicle to share ideas and possible solutions to the myriad of complex issues facing the world of trade. Between June and October 2006, Ruwe interviewed growers, food processors, manufacturers, importers and exporters. Program participants included corporate CEOs, members of Chamber and Commerce, Professors in Agricultural and Business schools, and US government officials in the trade departments. In 2008, Ruwe, in league with distinguished scholars, Dr. Miles Ishigaki, professor at Fresno State, and Dr. Robert Marquez, scientist and affiliated New Mexico State University professor, created Africa Center (USA) a non- profit, all-inclusive clearinghouse for philanthropists, donors and sympathizers wishing to help African relief efforts and improve the lives of the displaced, impoverished and diseased in many parts of sub-Saharan Africa. 2011- Ruwe is the author of \\"Hunt for Successor Series\\" based on Zambian politics. His article \\"Hunt for Successor 8: Zambian Intellectuals are Lazy\\" (retitled 'You Lazy (Intellectual) African Scum!' ) went viral. He is the author of the \\"Biography of President of Zambia Michael Chilufya Sata.\\" Following the death of the president parts of the article were quoted by the New York Times, and Agence France-Presse (AFP). Personal life Dr. Ruwe is married to Dr. Mathilda Bwalya Ruwe a medical doctor and research scientist. He is a father of three children, Thembinkosi, Dalitso (Dr. Dalitso Ruwe) and Rachel, and a grandfather of three, Martin, Zoe and Gabriel.

This map does not show Greenland, which is part of the Arctic cultural area. Visual arts by indigenous peoples of the Americas encompasses the visual artistic practices of the indigenous peoples of the Americas from ancient times to the present. These include works from South America and North America, which includes Central America and Greenland. The Siberian Yupiit, who have great cultural overlap with Native Alaskan Yupiit, are also included. Indigenous American visual arts include portable arts, such as painting, basketry, textiles, or photography, as well as monumental works, such as architecture, land art, public sculpture, or murals. Some Indigenous artforms coincide with Western art forms; however, some, such as porcupine quillwork or birchbark biting are unique to the Americas. Indigenous art of the Americas has been collected by Europeans since sustained contact in 1492 and joined collections in cabinet of curiosities and early museums. More conservative Western art museums have classified Indigenous art of the Americas within arts of Africa, Oceania, and the Americas, with precontact artwork classified as pre-Columbian art, a term that sometimes refers to only precontact art by Indigenous peoples of Latin America. Native scholars and allies are striving to have Indigenous art understood and interpreted from Indigenous perspectives. Lithic and Archaic stage In North America, the Lithic stage or Paleo-Indian period is defined as approximately 18,000‚Äì8000 BCE. The period from around 8000‚Äì800 BCE is generally referred to as the Archaic period. While people of this time period worked in a wide range of materials, perishable materials, such as plant fibers or hides, had seldom been preserved through the millennia. Indigenous peoples created bannerstones, Projectile point, Lithic reduction styles and pictographic cave paintings, some of which have survived in the present. Belonging in the Lithic stage, the oldest known art in the Americas is a carved megafauna bone, possibly from a mammoth, etched with a profile of walking mammoth or mastodon that dates back to 11,000 BCE. The bone was found early in the 21st century near Vero Beach, Florida, in an area where human bones (Vero man) had been found in association with extinct pleistocene animals early in the 20th century. The bone is too mineralized to be dated, but the carving has been authenticated as having been made before the bone became mineralized. The anatomical correctness of the carving and the heavy mineralization of the bone indicate that the carving was made while mammoths and/or mastodons still lived in the area, more than 10,000 years ago. The oldest known painted object in North American is the Cooper Bison Skull from approximately 8,050 BCE.Bement, Leland C. Bison hunting at Cooper site: where lightning bolts drew thundering herds.

Both pictographs and petroglyphs are known as rock art.

Indigenous peoples of the Canadian arctic have produced objects that could be classified as art since the time of the Dorset culture. While the walrus ivory carvings of the Dorset were primarily shamanic, the art of the Thule people who replaced them circa 1000 CE was more decorative in character. With European contact the historic period of Inuit art began. In this period, which reached its height in the late 19th century, Inuit artisans created souvenirs for the crews of whaling ships and explorers. Common examples include cribbage boards. Modern Inuit art began in the late 1940s, when with the encouragement of the Canadian government they began to produce prints and serpentine sculptures for sale in the south. Greenlandic Inuit have a unique textile tradition intregrating skin-sewing, furs, and appliqu√© of small pieces of brightly dyed marine mammal organs in mosaic designs, called avittat. Women create elaborate netted beadwork collars. They have strong mask-making tradition and also are known for an art form called tupilaq or an \\"evil spirit object.\\" Traditional art making practices thrive in the Ammassalik.Hessel, 20 Sperm whale ivory remains a valued medium for carving.Hessel, 21 Basket with bear and seal carving by George Omnik, Point Hope, Alaska, Eskimo, HAA.jpgBaleen basket with whale tooth finial, by George Omnik (I√±upiaq, 1905-1978), Alaska; Honolulu Museum of Art (Hawaii, USA) Tupilak 1.jpgA carved representation of a tupilaq, from Greenland Alaska, yup'ik, maschera giimaquq, xix secolo.jpgYup'ik mask; from Alaska; Mus√©e du quai Branly (Paris) PaQi 2.jpgToy Angakkuq (shaman); 6 February 1998; serpentine, caribou bone & feathers; by Palaya Qiatsuq Subarctic Cultures of interior Alaska and Canada living south of the Arctic Circle are Subarctic peoples. While humans have lived in the region far longer, the oldest known surviving Subarctic art is a petroglyph site in northwest Ontario, dated to 5000 BCE. Caribou, and to a lesser extent moose, are major resources, providing hides, antlers, sinew, and other artistic materials. Porcupine quillwork embellishes hides and birchbark. After European contact with the influence of the Grey Nuns, moosehair tufting and floral glass beadwork became popular through the Subarctic.A History of Native Art in Canada and North America.

Famous examples include totem poles, transformation masks, and canoes. In addition to woodwork, two dimensional painting and silver, gold and copper engraved jewelry became important after contact with Europeans.

While there were many regionally distinct cultures, trade between them was common and they shared the practice of burying their dead in earthen mounds, which has preserved a large amount of their art. Because of this trait the cultures are collectively known as the Mound builders. The Woodland period (1000 BCE‚Äì1000 CE) is divided into early, middle, and late periods, and consisted of cultures that relied mostly on hunting and gathering for their subsistence. Ceramics made by the Deptford culture (2500 BCE‚Äì100 CE) are the earliest evidence of an artistic tradition in this region. The Adena culture are another well-known example of an early Woodland culture. They carved stone tablets with zoomorphic designs, created pottery, and fashioned costumes from animal hides and antlers for ceremonial rituals. Shellfish was a mainstay of their diet, and engraved shells have been found in their burial mounds. The Middle Woodland period was dominated by cultures of the Hopewell tradition (200‚Äì500). Their artwork encompassed a wide variety of jewelry and sculpture in stone, wood, and even human bone. The Late Woodland period (500‚Äì1000 CE) saw a decline in trade and in the size of settlements, and the creation of art likewise declined. From the 12th century onward, the Haudenosaunee and nearby coastal tribes fashioned wampum from shells and string; these were mnemonic devices, currency, and records of treaties. Iroquois people carve False Face masks for healing rituals, but the traditional representatives of the tribes, the Grand Council of the Haudenosaunee, are clear that these masks are not for sale or public display.Shenadoah, Chief Leon.

One such artist is Sharol Graves, whose serigraphs have been exhibited in the National Museum of the American Indian. Graves is also the illustrator of The People Shall Continue from Lee & Low Books. Southeastern Woodlands The Poverty Point culture inhabited portions of the state of Louisiana from 2000 to 1000 BCE during the Archaic period. Many objects excavated at Poverty Point sites were made of materials that originated in distant places, including chipped stone projectile points and tools, ground stone plummets, gorgets and vessels, and shell and stone beads. Stone tools found at Poverty Point were made from raw materials which originated in the relatively nearby Ouachita and Ozark Mountains and from the much further away Ohio and Tennessee River valleys. Vessels were made from soapstone which came from the Appalachian foothills of Alabama and Georgia. Hand-modeled lowly fired clay objects occur in a variety of shapes including anthropomorphic figurines and cooking balls.

They built platform mounds larger and more complex than those of their predecessors, and finished and developed more advanced ceramic techniques, commonly using ground mussel shell as a tempering agent. Many were involved with the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex, a pan-regional and pan-linguistic religious and trade network. The majority of the information known about the S.E.C.C. is derived from examination of the elaborate artworks left behind by its participants, including pottery, shell gorgets and cups, stone statuary, repouss√© copper plates such as the Wulfing cache, Rogan plates, and Long-nosed god maskettes. By the time of European contact the Mississippian societies were already experiencing severe social stress, and with the political upheavals and diseases introduced by Europeans many of the societies collapsed and ceased to practice a Mississippian lifestyle, with notable exceptions being the Plaquemine culture Natchez and related Taensa peoples. Other tribes descended from Mississippian cultures include the Caddo, Choctaw, Muscogee Creek, Wichita, and many other southeastern peoples.

While the oldest wooden artifacts are as much as 10,000 years old, carved and painted wooden objects are known only from the past 2,000 years. Animal effigies and face masks have been found at a number of sites in Florida. Animal effigies dating to between 200 and 600 were found in a mortuary pond at Fort Center, on the west side of Lake Okeechobee. Particularly impressive is a 66 cm tall carving of an eagle. More than 1,000 carved and painted wooden objects, including masks, tablets, plaques and effigies, were excavated in 1896 at Key Marco, in southwestern Florida. They have been described as some of the finest prehistoric Native American art in North America. The objects are not well dated, but may belong to the first millienium of the current era. Spanish missionaries described similar masks and effigies in use by the Calusa late in the 17th century, and at the former Tequesta site on the Miami River in 1743, although no examples of the Calusa objects from the historic period have survived. A south Florida effigy style is known from wooden and bone carvings from various sites in the Belle Glade, Caloosahatchee, and Glades culture areas. The Seminoles are best known for their textile creations, especially patchwork clothing. Doll-making is another notable craft.Material from the State Archives of Florida.

Early Plains cultures are commonly divided into four periods: Paleoindian (at least c. 10,000‚Äì4000 BCE), Plains Archaic (c. 4000‚Äì250 BCE), Plains Woodland (c. 250 BCE‚Äì950 CE), Plains Village (c. 950-1850 CE).Pyburn, Anne. \\"Peoples of the Great Plains\\". Indiana University.. Retrieved 29 January 2010 The oldest known painted object in North American was found in the southern plains, the Cooper Bison Skull, found in Oklahoma and dated 10,900-10,200 BCE. It's painted with a red zig-zag. In the Plains Village period, the cultures of the area settled in enclosed clusters of rectangular houses and cultivated maize. Various regional differences emerged, including Southern Plains, Central Plains, Oneota, and Middle Missouri. Tribes were both nomadic hunters and semi-nomadic farmers. During the Plains Coalescent period (1400-European contact) some change, possibly drought, caused the mass migration of the population to the Eastern Woodlands region, and the Great Plains were sparsely populated until pressure from American settlers drove tribes into the area again. The advent of the horse revolutionized the cultures of many historical Plains tribes. Horse culture enabled tribes to live a completely nomadic existence, hunting buffalo. Buffalo hide clothing was decorated with porcupine quill embroidery and beads ‚Äì dentalium shells and elk teeth were prized materials. Later coins and glass beads acquired from trading were incorporated into Plains art. Plains beadwork has flourished into contemporary times. Buffalo was the preferred material for Plains hide painting. Men painted narrative, pictorial designs recording personal exploits or visions. They also painted pictographic historical calendars known as Winter counts. Women painted geometric designs on tanned robes and rawhide parfleches, which sometimes served as maps.\\"Native American and First Nations' GIS.\\" Native Geography. Dec 2000. Retrieved 29 January 2010 During the Reservation Era of the late 19th century, buffalo herds were systematically destroyed by non-native hunters. Due to the scarcity of hides, Plains artists adopted new painting surfaces, such as muslin or paper, giving birth to Ledger art, so named for the ubiquitous ledger books used by Plains artists.

Great Basin and Plateau Since the archaic period the Plateau region, also known as the Intermontaine and upper Great Basin, had been a center of trade. Plateau people traditionally settled near major river systems.Berlo and Phillips, 131 Because of this, their art carries influences from other regions ‚Äì from the Pacific Northwest coasts and Great Plains. Nez Perce, Yakama, Umatilla, and Cayuse women weave flat, rectangular corn husks or hemp dogbane bags, which are decorated with \\"bold, geometric designs\\" in false embroidery.Berlo and Phillips, 132 Plateau beadworkers are known for their contour-style beading and their elaborate horse regalia. Great Basin tribes have a sophisticated basket making tradition, as exemplified by Dat So La Lee/Louisa Keyser (Washoe), Lucy Telles, Carrie Bethel and Nellie Charlie. After being displaced from their lands by non-Native settlers, Washoe wove baskets for the commodity market, especially 1895 to 1935.Berlo and Phillips, 136 Paiute, Shoshone and Washoe basketmakers are known for their baskets that incorporate seed beads on the surface and for waterproof baskets.Garey-Sage, Darla. \\"Contemporary Great Basin Basketmakers.\\" The Online Nevada Encyclopedia..

In the late 19th-century Californian baskets by artists in the Cahuilla, Chumash, Pomo, Miwok, Hupa and many other tribes became popular with collectors, museums, and tourists. This resulted in great innovation in the form of the baskets. Many pieces by Native American basket weavers from all parts of California are in museum collections, such as the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology at Harvard University, the Southwest Museum, and the Smithsonian Institution National Museum of the American Indian. California has a large number of pictographs and petroglyphs rock art. One of the largest densities of petroglyphs in North America, by the Coso people, is in Big and Little Petroglyph Canyons in the Coso Rock Art District of the northern Mojave Desert in California. The most elaborate pictographs in the U.S are considered to be the rock art of the Chumash people, found in cave paintings in present- day Santa Barbara, Ventura, and San Luis Obispo Counties. The Chumash cave painting includes examples at Chumash Painted Cave State Historic Park and Burro Flats Painted Cave.

The Fremont culture and Ancestral Puebloans and later tribes' creations, in the Barrier Canyon Style and others, are seen at present day Buckhorn Draw Pictograph Panel and Horseshoe Canyon, amongst other sites. Petroglyphs by these and the Mogollon culture's artists are represented in Dinosaur National Monument and at Newspaper Rock. The Ancestral Puebloans, or Anasazi, (1000 BCE‚Äì700 CE) are the ancestors of today's Pueblo tribes. Their culture formed in the American southwest, after the cultivation of corn was introduced from Mexico around 1200 BCE. People of this region developed an agrarian lifestyle, cultivating food, storage gourds, and cotton with irrigation or xeriscaping techniques. They lived in sedentary towns, so pottery, used to store water and grain, was ubiquitous. For hundreds of years, Ancestral Pueblo created utilitarian grayware and black-on-white pottery and occasionally orange or red ceramics. In historical times, Hopi created ollas, dough bowls, and food bowls of different sizes for daily use, but they also made more elaborate ceremonial mugs, jugs, ladles, seed jars and those vessels for ritual use, and these were usually finished with polished surfaces and decorated with black painted designs. At the turn of the 20th century, Hopi potter Nampeyo famous revived Siky√°tki-style pottery, originated on First Mesa in the 14th to 17th centuries.\\"Ancestral Hopi Pottery\\". Arizona State Museum. 2007. Retrieved 14 August 2010 Southwest architecture includes Cliff dwellings, multi-story settlements carved from living rock; pit houses; and adobe and sandstone pueblos. One of the most elaborate and largest ancient settlements is Chaco Canyon in New Mexico, which includes 15 major complexes of sandstone and timber. These are connected by a network of roads. Construction for the largest of these settlements, Pueblo Bonito, began 1080 years before present. Pueblo Bonito contains over 800 rooms.\\"Chaco Canyon.\\" Minnesota State Museum, Mankato. Retrieved 14 August 2010 Turquoise, jet, and spiny oyster shell have been traditionally used by Ancestral Pueblo for jewelry, and they developed sophisticated inlay techniques centuries ago. Around 200 CE the Hohokam culture developed in Arizona. They are the ancestors of the Tohono O'odham and Akimel O'odham or Pima tribes. The Mimbres, a subgroup of the Mogollon culture, are especially notable for the narrative paintings on their pottery. Within the last millennium, Athabaskan peoples emigrated from northern Canada in the southwest. These include the Navajo and Apache. Sandpainting is an aspect of Navajo healing ceremonies that inspired an art form. Navajos learned to weave on upright looms from Pueblos and wove blankets that were eagerly collected by Great Basin and Plains tribes in the 18th and 19th centuries. After the introduction of the railroad in the 1880s, imported blankets became plentiful and inexpensive, so Navajo weavers switched to producing rugs for trade. In the 1850s, Navajos adopted silversmithing from the Mexicans. Atsidi Sani (Old Smith) was the first Navajo silversmith, but he had many students, and the technology quickly spread to surrounding tribes. Today thousands of artists produce silver jewelry with turquoise. Hopi are renowned for their overlay silver work and cottonwood carvings. Zuni artists are admired for their cluster work jewelry, showcasing turquoise designs, as well as their elaborate, pictorial stone inlay in silver.

Mesoamerica and Central America Map of the Mesoamerican cultural region. The cultural development of ancient Mesoamerica was generally divided along east and west. The stable Maya culture was most dominant in the east, especially the Yucat√°n Peninsula, while in the west more varied developments took place in subregions. These included West Mexican (1000‚Äì1), Teotihuacan (1‚Äì500), Mixtec (1000‚Äì1200), and Aztec (1200‚Äì1521). Central American civilizations generally lived to the regions south of modern-day Mexico, although there was some overlap. =Mesoamerica= Mesoamerica was home to the following cultures, among others: Olmec The Olmec (1500-400 BCE), who lived on the gulf coast, were the first civilization to fully develop in Mesoamerica. Their culture was the first to develop many traits that remained constant in Mesoamerica until the last days of the Aztecs: a complex astronomical calendar, the ritual practice of a ball game, and the erection of stelae to commemorate victories or other important events. The most famous artistic creations of the Olmec are colossal basalt heads, believed to be portraits of rulers that were erected to advertise their great power. The Olmec also sculpted votive figurines that they buried beneath the floors of their houses for unknown reasons. These were most often modeled in terracotta, but also occasionally carved from jade or serpentine. File:Olmeca head in Villahermosa.jpgMonument 1, one of the four Olmec colossal heads at La Venta.

In the past, Western art historians have considered use of Western art media or exhibiting in international art arena as criteria for \\"modern\\" Native American art history.Berlo and Phillips, 209. Native American art history is a new and highly contested academic discipline, and these Eurocentric benchmarks are followed less and less today. Many media considered appropriate for easel art were employed by Native artists for centuries, such as stone and wood sculpture and mural painting. Ancestral Pueblo artists painted with tempera on woven cotton fabric, at least 800 years ago.Dunn, p. xxviii. Certain Native artists used non-Indian art materials as soon as they became available. For example, Texcocan artist Fernando de Alva Cort√©s Ixtlilx√≥chitl painted with ink and watercolor on paper in the late 16th century. Bound together in the Codex Ixtlilx√≥chitl, these portraits of historical Texcocan leaders are rendered with shading, modeling and anatomic accuracy.Levenson, pp. 554‚Äì555. The Cuzco School of Peru featured Quechua easel painters in the 17th and 18th centuries. The first cabinets of curiosities in the 16th century, precursors to modern museums, featured Native American art. The notion that fine art cannot be functional has not gained widespread acceptance in the Native American art world, as evidenced by the high esteem and value placed upon rugs, blankets, basketry, weapons, and other utilitarian items in Native American art shows. A dichotomy between fine art and craft is not commonly found in contemporary Native art. For example, the Cherokee Nation honors its greatest artists as Living Treasures, including frog- and fish-gig makers, flint knappers, and basket weavers, alongside sculptors, painters, and textile artists.Chavez, Will. 2006 Cherokee National Living Treasure artists announced. The Cherokee Phoenix. 2006.

In the Pacific Northwest and the Great Lakes region, tribes dependent upon the rapidly diminishing fur trade adopted art production a means of financial support. A painting movement known as the Iroquois Realist School emerged among the Haudenosaunee in New York in the 1820s, spearheaded by the brothers David and Dennis Cusick.Sturtevant, p. 129 African-Ojibwe sculptor, Edmonia Lewis maintained a studio in Rome, Italy and carved Neoclassicist marble sculptors from the 1860s-1880s. Her mother belonged to the Mississauga band of the Credit River Indian Reserve. Lewis exhibited widely, and a testament to her popularity during her own time was that President Ulysses S. Grant commissioned her to carve his portrait in 1877.Wolfe, pp. 12, 14, 108, and 120 Ho-Chunk artist, Angel De Cora was the best known Native American artist before World War I.Hutchinson, p. 740 She was taken from her reservation and family to the Hampton Institute, where she began her lengthy formal art training.Hutchinson, p. 742 Active in the Arts and Crafts movement, De Cora exhibited her paintings and design widely and illustrated books by Native authors. She strove to be tribally specific in her work and was revolutionary for portraying Indians in contemporary clothing of the early 20th century. She taught art to young Native students at Carlisle Indian Industrial School and was an outspoken advocate of art as a means for Native Americans to maintain cultural pride, while finding a place in mainstream society.Hutchinson, p. 754 The Kiowa Six, a group of Kiowa painters from Oklahoma, met with international success when their mentor, Oscar Jacobson, showed their paintings in First International Art Exposition in Prague, Czechoslovakia in 1928.Pochoir prints of ledger drawings by the Kiowa Five, 1929.

John Collier became Commissioner of Indian Affairs in 1933 and temporarily reversed the BIA's assimilationist policies by encouraging Native American arts and culture. By this time, Native American art exhibits and the art market increased, gaining wider audiences. In the 1920s and 1930s, Indigenist art movements flourished in Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia, and Mexico, most famously with the Mexican Muralist movements. =Basketry= Yahgan basket, woven by Abuela Cristina Calder√≥n, Chile, photo by Jim Cadwell Basket weaving is one of the ancient and most-widespread art forms in the Americas. From coiled sea lyme grass baskets in Nunavut to bark baskets in Tierra del Fuego, Native artists weave baskets from a wide range of materials. Typically baskets are made of vegetable fibers, but Tohono O'odham are known for their horsehair baskets and Inupiaq artists weave baskets from baleen, filtering plates of certain whales.Hessel, Arctic Spirit, p. 17 Grand Traverse Band Kelly Church, Wasco-Wishram Pat Gold, and Eastern Band Cherokee Joel Queen all weave baskets from copper sheets or wire, and Mi'kmaq-Onondaga conceptual artist Gail Tremblay weaves baskets in the traditional fancywork patterns of her tribes from exposed film.

Retrieved 16 March 2009 A range of native grasses provides material for Arctic baskets, as does baleen, which is a 20th- century development. Baleen baskets are typically embellished with walrus ivory carvings. Cedar bark is often used in northwest coastal baskets. Throughout the Great Lakes and northeast, black ash and sweetgrass are woven into fancy work, featuring \\"porcupine\\" points, or decorated as strawberries. Bark baskets are traditional for gathering berries. Rivercane is the preferred material in the Southeast, and Chitimachas are regarded as the finest rivercane weavers. In Oklahoma, rivercane is prized but rare so baskets are typically made of honeysuckle or buckbrush runners. Coiled baskets are popular in the southwest and the Hopi and Apache in particular are known for pictorial coiled basketry plaques. The Tohono O'odham are well known for their basket- weaving prowess, and evidenced by the success of Annie Antone and Terrol Dew Johnson. Kumeyaay coiled basket, Celestine Lachapa of Inajo, late 19th centuryCalifornia and Great Basin tribes are considered some of the finest basket weavers in the world. Juncus is a common material in southern California, while sedge, willow, redbud, and devil's claw are also used. Pomo basket weavers are known to weave 60‚Äì100 stitches per inch and their rounded, coiled baskets adorned with quail's topknots, feathers, abalone, and clamshell discs are known as \\"treasure baskets\\". Three of the most celebrated Californian basket weavers were Elsie Allen (Pomo), Laura Somersal (Wappo), and the late Pomo-Patwin medicine woman, Mabel McKay,Dalrymple, p. 2 known for her biography, Weaving the Dream.

Plains tribes are master beaders, and today dance regalia for man and women feature a variety of beadwork styles. While Plains and Plateau tribes are renowned for their beaded horse trappings, Subarctic tribes such as the Dene bead lavish floral dog blankets.Berlo and Philips, p. 151 Eastern tribes have a completely different beadwork aesthetic, and Innu, Mi'kmaq, Penobscot, and Haudenosaunee tribes are known for symmetrical scroll motifs in white beads, called the \\"double curve.\\"Berlo and Phillips, p. 146 Iroquois are also known for \\"embossed\\" beading in which strings pulled taut force beads to pop up from the surface, creating a bas-relief.

Roger Amerman, Marcus' brother, and Martha Berry, Cherokee, have effectively revived Southeastern beadwork, a style that had been lost because of forced removal from tribes to Indian Territory. Their beadwork commonly features white bead outlines, an echo of the shell beads or pearls Southeastern tribes used before contact.Berlo and Phillips, p. 87 Jamie Okuma (Luise√±o-Shoshone- Bannock) was won top awards with her beaded dolls, which can include entire families or horses and riders, all with fully beaded regalia.

Recent scholarship by Mique‚Äôl Askren (Tsimshian/Tlingit) on the photographs of B.A. Haldane has analyzed the functions that Haldane's photographs served for his community: as markers of success by having Anglo-style formal portraits taken, and as markers of the continuity of potlaching and traditional ceremonials by having photographs taken in ceremonial regalia. This second category is particularly significant because the use of the ceremonial regalia was against the law in Canada between 1885 and 1951.

Printmaking has flourished among Inuit communities in particular. European-Canadian James Houston created a graphic art program in Cape Dorset, Nunavut in 1957.Hessel, Arctic Spirit, p. 49 Houston taught local Inuit stone carvers how to create prints from stone-blocks and stencils. He asked local artists to draw pictures and the shop generated limited edition prints, based on the ukiyo-e workshop system of Japan. Cooperative print shops were also established in nearby communities, including Baker Lake, Puvirnituq, Holman, and Pangnirtung. These shops have experimented with etching, engraving, lithography, and silkscreen. Shops produced annual catalogs advertising their collections. Local birds and animals, spirit beings, and hunting scenes are the most popular subject matter, but are allegorical in nature.Hessel, Arctic Spirit, p. 52 Backgrounds tend to be minimal and perspective is mixed.Hessel, Arctic Spirit, p. 50 One of the most prominent of Cape Dorset artists is Kenojuak Ashevak (born 1927), who has received many public commissions and two honorary doctorate degrees. Other prominent Inuit printmakers and graphic artists include Parr, Osuitok Ipeelee, Germaine Arnaktauyok, Pitseolak Ashoona, Tivi Etok, Helen Kalvak, Jessie Oonark, Kananginak Pootoogook, Pudlo Pudlat, Irene Avaalaaqiaq Tiktaalaaq, and Simon Tookoome. Inuit printmaker Andrew Qappik designed the coat of arms of Nunavut. Many Native painters transformed their paintings into fine art prints. Potawatomi artist Woody Crumbo created bold, screen prints and etchings in the mid-20th century that blended traditional, flat Bacone Style with Art Deco influences. Kiowa-Caddo-Choctaw painter, T.C. Cannon traveled to Japan to study wood block printing from master printers. In Chile, Mapuche printmaker Santos Ch√°vez (1934‚Äì2001) was one of the most celebrated artists of his country ‚Äì with over 85 solo exhibitions during his lifetime.Jose Santos Chavez.

Stone sculptures are ubiquitous through the Americas, in the forms of stelae, inuksuit, and statues. Alabaster stone carving is popular among Western tribes, where catlinite carving is traditional in the Northern Plains and fetish-carving is traditional in the Southwest, particularly among the Zuni. The Ta√≠no of Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic are known for their zemis‚Äì sacred, three-pointed stone sculptures. Inuit artists sculpt with walrus ivory, caribou antlers, bones, soapstone, serpentinite, and argillite. They often represent local fauna and humans engaged in hunting or ceremonial activities. Edmonia Lewis paved the way for Native American artists to sculpt in mainstream traditions using non-Native materials. Allan Houser (Warms Springs Chiricahua Apache) became one of the most prominent Native sculptors of the 20th century. Though he worked in wood and stone, Houser is most known for his monumental bronze sculptors, both representational and abstract. Houser influenced a generation of Native sculptors by teaching at the Institute of American Indian Arts. His two sons, Phillip and Bob Haozous are sculptors today. Roxanne Swentzell (Santa Clara Pueblo) is known for her expressive, figurative, ceramic sculptures but has also branched into bronze casting, and her work is permanently displayed at the National Museum of the American Indian. The Northwest Coastal tribes are known for their woodcarving ‚Äì most famously their monumental totem poles that display clan crests. During the 19th century and early 20th century, this art form was threatened but was effectively revived. Kwakwaka'wakw totem pole carvers such as Charlie James, Mungo Martin, Ellen Neel, and Willie Seaweed kept the art alive and also carved masks, furniture, bentwood boxes, and jewelry. Haida carvers include Charles Edenshaw, Bill Reid, and Robert Davidson. Besides working in wood, Haida also work with argillite. Traditional formline designs translate well into glass sculpture, which is increasingly popular thanks to efforts by contemporary glass artists such as Preston Singletary (Tlingit), Susan Point (Coast Salish) and Marvin Oliver (Quinault/Isleta Pueblo).Tall Chief, Russ.

Designs can be pictorial or abstract, based on traditional Navajo, Spanish, Oriental, or Persian designs. 20th-century Navajo weavers include Clara Sherman and Hosteen Klah, who co- founded the Wheelwright Museum of the American Indian. In 1973, the Navajo Studies Department of the Din√© College in Many Farms, Arizona, wanted to determine how long it took a Navajo weaver to create a rug or blanket from sheep shearing to market. The study determined the total amount of time was 345 hours. Out of these 345 hours, the expert Navajo weaver needed: 45 hours to shear the sheep and process the wool; 24 hours to spin the wool; 60 hours to prepare the dye and to dye the wool; 215 hours to weave the piece; and only one hour to sell the item in their shop.http://nativeamerican-art.com/navajo- blankets.html Customary textiles of Northwest Coast peoples using non-Western materials and techniques are enjoying a dramatic revival. Chilkat weaving and Ravenstail weaving are regarded as some of the most difficult weaving techniques in the world. A single Chilkat blanket can take an entire year to weave. In both techniques, dog, mountain goat, or sheep wool and shredded cedar bark are combined to create textiles featuring curvilinear formline designs. Tlingit weaver Jennie Thlunaut (1982‚Äì1986) was instrumental in this revival.

Retrieved 15 May 2011 Museum representation Indigenous American arts have had a long and complicated relationship with museum representation since the early 1900s. In 1931, The Exposition of Indian Tribal Arts was the first large scale show that held Indigenous art on display. Their portrayal in museums grew more common later in the 1900s as a reaction to the Civil Rights Movement. With the rising trend of representation in the political atmosphere, minority voices gained more representation in museums as well. Although Indigenous art was being displayed, the curatorial choices on how to display their work were not always made with the best of intentions. For instance, Native American art pieces and artifacts would often be shown alongside dinosaur bones, implying that they are a people of the past and non-existent or irrelevant in today's world. Native American remains were on display in museums up until the 1960s. Though many did not yet view Native American art as a part of the mainstream as of the year 1992, there has since then been a great increase in volume and quality of both Native art and artists, as well as exhibitions and venues, and individual curators. Such leaders as the director of the National Museum of the American Indian insist that Native American representation be done from a first-hand perspective.Brockman, Joshua. \\"A New Dawn for Museums of Native American Art\\". The New York Times, 20 Aug. 2005, www.nytimes.com/2005/08/20/arts/design/a-new-dawn-for-museums- of-native-american-art.html. The establishment of such museums as the Heard Museum and the National Museum of the American Indian, both of which trained spotlights specifically upon Native American arts, enabled a great number of Native artists to display and develop their work. For five months starting in October 2017, three Native American works of art selected from the Charles and Valerie Diker Collection to be exhibited in the American Wing at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.Yount, Sylvia. \\"Redefining American Art: Native American Art in The American Wing\\".

Museum representation for Indigenous artists calls for great responsibility from curators and museum institutions. The Indian Arts and Crafts Act of 1990 prohibits non-Indigenous artists from exhibiting as Native American artists. Institutions and curators work discussing whom to represent, why are they being chosen, what Indigenous art looks like, and what its purpose is. Museums, as educational institutions, give light to cultures and narratives that would otherwise go unseen; they provide a necessary spotlight and who they choose to represent is pivotal to the history of the represented artists and culture.

See Pushkin, Aleksandr, Antony Wood and Simon Brett. (2006) The Gypsies & Other Narrative Poems. Boston, MA: David R. Godine. pp. xxi‚Äìxxii. The poem has inspired at least eighteen operas and several ballets.See Gasparov, Boris. (2006) \\"Pushkin in music\\" in The Cambridge Companion to Pushkin, ed. Andrew Kahn. Cambridge: CUP. p. 159 Outline The poem opens with an establishment of the setting in Bessarabia and a colorful, lively description of the activities of a gypsy camp there: The poem is written almost exclusively in iambic tetrameter, and this regular metre is established from the outset: √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / –ì–æ—Ä–∏—Ç –æ–≥–æ–Ω—å; —Å–µ–º—å—è –∫—Ä—É–≥–æ–º Gor√≠t og√≥n'; sem'y√° krug√≥m √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó –ì–æ—Ç–æ–≤–∏—Ç —É–∂–∏–Ω –≤ —á–∏—Å—Ç–æ–º –ø–æ–ª–µ (ll.9‚Äì10) Got√≥vit √∫zhin v ch√≠stom p√≥le :(Burns a flame, and the family around it / Cook their supper; in the fresh field.) Once the scene is set, the characters are introduced: an old man is waiting for his daughter Zemfira to return home while his dinner grows cold. When she arrives, she announces that she has brought home with her a man, Aleko, who has fled the city because the law is pursuing him. At this point the narrative style changes: the omniscient narrator steps aside and the majority of the rest of the poem takes the form of a dialogue, following the tradition of closet drama. The Old Man and Zemfira welcome Aleko, but he retains lingering doubts about the possibility of happiness at the Gypsy camp: Aleko is established as a Romantic hero: the narrator describes him as a tormented victim of passion and sounds an ominous note that his passions will return. Zemfira asks Aleko if he misses the splendor of his homeland, but he responds that his only desire is to spend his life with her in voluntary exile. (ll.174‚Äì176). The Old Man warns that although Aleko loves the Gypsy life, this feeling may not last forever, and tells a story of a man that he knew who spent his entire life with the Gypsies but who eventually pined for his homeland and asked to be buried there. (ll.181‚Äì216). This is thought to be a reference to the Roman poet Ovid, who was banished to Tomis in 8 AD.See Bondi's notes to the 1960 version. Two years pass (l.225) and Aleko remains with Zemfira in the Gypsy camp. However, Zemfira begins to sing a love song about an adulterous affair which shocks and scares Aleko (ll.259‚Äì266). At this point the poem switches from iambic tetrameter and is less consistent with fewer feet. The Old Man warns Aleko that he has heard this song before from his wife Mariula who later left him. Aleko is upset by the song and falls asleep, and Zemfira is angry when she hears him pronounce another woman's name in his sleep (l.327). The Old Man warns Aleko not to expect Zemfira to be faithful (ll.287‚Äì299), and tells him in detail about how Mariula left him after only a year (ll.370‚Äì409). Aleko, however, insists on his \\"rights\\" (l.419), or at least the possibility of getting the pleasure of revenge (l.420). Zemfira meets her lover at night and, just as they are parting, Aleko catches them together. In a scene of extremely fast-moving dialogue, he kills them both. The Old Man tells him to leave the Gypsies because his understanding of law, freedom and order is different from his (ll.510‚Äì520): The poem closes with an epilogue narrated in the first person, who warns that the gypsy encampments offer no freedom from the \\"fateful passions\\" and problems of life. Analysis The poem addresses and interrogates the concept of the noble savage, an idea which had gained popular currency in the Romantic Age which held that those people who live further from \\"civilization\\" live \\"in harmony with nature and a more simple, childlike and blessed life\\" than the alienated and unhappy people in European cities.See entries on the \\"Noble Savage\\" and \\"Aleksandr Pushkin\\" in The Encyclopedia of the Romantic Era 1760‚Äì1850\\", ed. Christopher John Murray. (2004) London: Taylor and Francis Aleko's failure to integrate with the gypsies and his continued insistence on the moral standards of the city in the gypsy encampment challenge the notion that happiness can be found by reverting to nature. The poem closes with a clear attack on the idea of the noble savage: \\"But even among you, poor sons of nature, there is no happiness! Tormenting dreams live under your bedraggled tents\\".

The \\"Southern Poems\\" are indebted to Byron: they use exotic and orientalized settings, rapid transitions, and chart sexual and military conquest.The classic study of Pushkin and Byron is Zhirmunskii, V. M. (1924). Bairon i Pushkin. Leningrad, Nauka. For an up-to- date English-language summary of Byron's influence, see Bethea, David. \\"Pushkin and Byron\\" in The Routledge Companion to Russian Literature, ed. Neil Cornwell (London: Routledge) pp. 76‚Äì79. Stephanie Sandler sees it as an expression of \\"a kind of liberal individualism in which respect for the person is valued above all else, in which the dignity of the individual is fundamental.\\" However, critics agree that The Gypsies, while inheriting much from the Byronic tradition, also strives to move away from it. Michael Wachtel argues that \\"the grim, fatalistic acceptance of life as a tragedy and of individual experience as endless repetition brings the work closer to Antiquity than to Byron\\".Wachtel, Michael. (2006) \\"Pushkin's long poems and the epic impulse\\". In The Cambridge Companion to Pushkin\\", ed. Andrew Kahn. Cambridge: CUP, p. 82 Antony Wood suggests that The Gypsies is a parody of both Rousseau's Noble Savage idea and Byron's verse tales, pointing out that \\"Aleko, pursuing the ideal of the Noble Savage, himself comes to present the spectacle of an noble citizen.\\"Wood, p. xxiii John Bayley argues that The Gypsies \\"shows the problem of a poet as naturally classical as Pushkin in an epoch fashionably and self-consciously romantic.\\"Bayley, John. (1971) Pushkin: A Comparative Commentary. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. p. 90 Adaptations Boris Gasparov estimates that The Gypsies has inspired some eighteen operas and half a dozen ballets, including Sergei Rachmaninoff's Aleko (1893), Ruggero Leoncavallo's Zingari (1912), and Vasily Kalafati's Gypsies [Tsygany] (1941).Gasparov, p. 159 It is speculated that The Gypsies was the inspiration for Prosper M√©rim√©e's novella Carmen written in 1845, on which Georges Bizet's opera Carmen was based in 1875.Hammond A.
