The Nazi facility was built to train collaborationist military units, including the Ukrainian 14th Waffen SS Division \\"Galician\\", and units from Estonia. This training included killing operations inside the concentration camps ‚Äì most notably at the nearby Pustk√≥w and Szebnie camps ‚Äì and Jewish ghettos in the vicinity of the 'Heidelager'. The military area was situated in the triangle of the Wis≈Ça and San rivers, dominated by large forest areas. The centre of the Heidelager was at Blizna, the location of the secret Nazi V-2 missile launch site, which was built and staffed by prisoners from the concentration camp at Pustk√≥w.  History  The Nazis originally planned to erect a large SStraining camp near Pustk√≥w with barracks, warehouses, and buildings for the intelligence services. The facility was built by order of Reichsf√ºhrer-SS Heinrich Himmler under provision OKW No. 3032 of 21 December 1939, which allowed for construction of an SS military training centre in the area eastward of Dƒôbica in Generalgouvernement Polen. The training site was to be built as a barrack camp with four ring roads (called: Lager Flandern). It was planned to be completed on 1 October 1940 for two reinforced infantry regiments. To accomplish this, about a dozen villages near Pustk√≥w were evacuated and then razed. In order to provide sufficient labor to build this project, the Nazis initially set up a workers' camp. The camp opened on 26 June 1940 with the arrival the first forced labourers, mostly Jews and Belgian prisoners. Most of the Jewish prisoners were relocated from the Krakow, Rzeszow, and Tarnow ghettos and brought to the camp. The Jewish camp comprised two barracks, which, at the camp's height, were filled with around 465 prisoners. The conditions were so terrible that most prisoners did not survive the first few months. Over its four-year history, the name of the SSmilitary training centre changed several times. During the planning stages, it was named \\"Ostpolen\\" (between 21 December 1939 and 26 June 1940.) When construction of the site started on 26 June 1940, it was renamed SS\\"Dƒôbica\\". From 15 March 1943, the site was designated as SS \\"Heidelager\\". The camp had been in use since the autumn of 1941 under the command of Oberf√ºhrer-SS Werner vonSchele. The location was expanded into a prisoner of war camp for Red Army soldiers captured in the Soviet zone of occupied Poland after the implementation of Operation Barbarossa. The first of them arrived in October 1941.Schulte, Jan Erik Zwangsarbeit und Vernichtung: Das Wirtschaftsimperium der SS. Oswald Pohl und das SS-Wirtschafts-Verwaltungshauptamt 1933‚Äì1945. Mit einem Vorwort von Hans Mommsen. Sch√∂ningh, Paderborn u. a. 2001, (Zugleich: Bochum, Universit√§t, Dissertation, 1999). (in German) In the beginning, the POW camp was no more than an enclosed area. The prisoners received minimal or no food, and were reduced to eating grass and roots. There were no barracks, so prisoners had to sleep out in the open. This lack of shelter killed many prisoners during the severe winter of 1941‚Äì42. Many were tortured and mistreated, or were executed en masse at the foot of what became known as the ('Hill of death'), its real name being . On this hill the dead inmates were cremated in specially built funeral pyres. A third camp for Polish forced labourers was established in September 1942. The conditions were no better than those at the first two camps. The forced labourers were involved in the development and production of the V-1 and V-2 rockets in the nearby missile launch site in Blizna. From 1943 the camp was guarded by units of the 204th Schutzmannschafts Battalion, a battalion consisting of ethnic Ukrainians from the area of Lviv. In addition to working on the development of the V-1 and V-2 rockets, the AEG used labor from Jews in the Pustk√≥w camp for electrical installations in the Waffen-SS Dƒôbica training areas beginning in 1941. The total number of victims in the Pustk√≥w camp is unknown. In 1944, with the Soviet army advancing, the camp was disbanded. All surviving prisoners were sent to nearby camps, such as the Krak√≥w-P≈Çasz√≥w camp. It is estimated that at least 15,000 people died or were killed, including approximately 5,000 Russian prisoner of war, 7,500 Jews, and 2,500 Poles. The last commandant of the training base was Totenkopfverb√§nde-Oberf√ºhrer-SS Bernhardt Voss, until the summer of 1944.Heinrich Himmler visiting concentration camp SS- Truppen√ºbungsplatz Heidelager with his Nazi entourage, on 28 September 1943 The facility resembled a small city with its own narrow-gauge railway line, some 3,600 men of different nationalities, cinemas, dining halls, dozens of villas, a newsletter, a large camp brothel staffed by female prisoners from the slave labour camp nearby, and regular hunting parties for the high-ranking officers. This is where the Galizien Division came into existence. The range was visited by Reichsf√ºhrer-SS Heinrich Himmler on 28 September 1943, and abandoned in the summer of 1944 ahead of the Soviet advance. After the camp was abandoned, the area was still defended by a combat group of the Waffen-SS, under the leadership of a SS storm-troopers. The camp was largely destroyed by fire during the evacuation of the military training centre. Because of the crimes committed on the military training ground, criminal charges were filed by Polish individuals with the Nazi war crimes commission. From 1959 onwards, extensive investigations were made in Germany to uncover the crimes.  Modern day  Reconstruction of camp commandant Bernhardt Voss' private office Today the site houses a reconstruction of huts in the camp. Inside the huts there is a museum, comprising original artefacts from the site, including a reconstruction of the camp commandant Oberf√ºhrer-SS Bernhardt Voss' private office.

His reported visitation by King Romulus, Rome's founder and first ruler, shortly after the king's disappearance convinces the people of Rome to accept Romulus' divinity and the claims by the senate that he had been taken up by the gods in a whirlwind.. Livy's account In the late-republican historian Livy's From the Founding of the City, Romulus is attending a public review of the army at Palus Caprae when a sudden, violent storm envelopes him in mist. When it clears, the King is gone. The nobles sitting hear him claimed that he had been carried into the sky by a divine force. The commoners present hail their now lost king and proclaim him a god. Despite this, suspicion immediately grows that the nobles had killed and dismembered him. Proculus is described by Livy as shrewd. He tells the people that at dawn, a vision of Romulus descended from the sky and told him that Rome and Roman might would rule the world. Livy expresses some surprise that this claim was able to so easily mollify the suspicions of both the plebs and the army. Plutarch's account Rubens Apparizione di Romolo e Proculo, (17c.) National Museum of Wales, Cardiff Plutarch tells a more detailed tale of Romulus' death. He lists several alternative stories, and then the tale of his disappearance at the assembly. Proculus was a friend of the king. He was a Roman colonist from the city of Alba. Before testifying to the Forum, he swore a sacred oath and then told the assembled that Romulus had descended from the sky in front of him. Proculus tells the assembly that he had asked Romulus why he had left them as he did, leaving so many in mourning and suspicions about his disappearance. Romulus explains that it was the will of the gods that he leave. He came to Earth to build a city destined to be the greatest on earth and now, his work was done. Rome, with \\"self-restraint\\" and \\"valor\\" will be the most dominant force on earth. Finally he tells Proculus that he will always watch over them as Quirinus. Because of his character and the oath, and, Plutarch adds, a divine force that came over the people, they abandoned their suspicion and anger.

It has rough, ribbony bark near the base, smooth grey to brownish above, lance-shaped adult leaves, flower buds arranged in groups of seven, yellow to cream-coloured flowers and cup-shaped or urn-shaped fruit. Description Eucalyptus dolichocera is a mallee, rarely a tree, that typically grows to a height of and has rough, ribbony, grey-brown or red-brown bark on the lowest of the trunk. Young plants and coppice regrowth have leaves arranged in opposite pairs, lance-shaped, slightly glaucous up to long and wide. Adult leaves are arranged alternately, lance-shaped, dull green, long and wide on a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in groups of seven on a peduncle long, the individual buds on a pedicel long. Mature buds are oval, long and wide with a narrow conical operculum up to three times as long as the floral cup. Flowering occurs between October and November and the flowers are yellow to cream-coloured. The fruit is a woody cup-shaped to urn-shaped capsule long and wide with the valves enclosed below the rim. Classification Eucalyptus dolichocera was first formally described by the botanists Lawrence Alexander Sidney Johnson and Ken Hill in 1999 in the journal Telopea. The type specimen was collected by Ian Brooker and Donald Blaxell in 1975 about north east of Kalbarri on the North West Coastal Highway. The specific epithet (dolichocera) is derived from the Ancient Greek words dolichos meaning \\"long\\" and keros meaning \\"horn\\" referring to the long narrow operculum. This species belongs to the Eucalyptus subgenus Symphyomyrtus in the section Bisectae and the subsection Destitutae. It is similar in appearance to Eucalyptus moderata. Distribution This mallee grows in laterite, limestone or sand on dunes, flats and sandplains and has a range from just north of Geraldton to Dowerin and Wongan Hills in the Avon Wheatbelt, Geraldton Sandplains, Mallee and Yalgoo biogeographic regions.

Hiyoshi Dam is a concrete gravity dam with a height of 67.4 m and a length of 438 m. It creates the artificial lake , with an area of 2.74 km¬≤. Initial planning for its construction started in 1961, as a measure to protect downstream area from frequent floods by the Katsura river. Hiyoshi Dam is used for three main purposes: flood control, river maintenance and water supply. The dam temporarily stores surges in river water during floods, regulating the flow and avoiding damage to downstream areas. The dam is designed for 100-year floods (floods estimated to occur once every 100 years). The maximum release of water during flood control operations in normal situations is 150 cubic meters per second. However, if not enough, the dam is able to discharge more water when the level in the reservoir surpass the surcharge water level. One such situations occurred in September 2013, when heavy rain from Typhoon 18 forced a maximum outflow of 504 cubic meters per second. In case of emergency, with floods bigger than the estimated 100-year flood for which the dam is designed, the emergency spillways can discharge up to 3,100 cubic meters per second, ensuring the safety of the structure. These spillways have been used only during trials. The dam also helps to ensure that the river water flow downstream is above a certain minimum level during drought periods. Hiyoshi Dam also supplies 3.7 cubic meters per second of additional water supply, sufficient for about 1 million people, supplying domestic water to cities in Kyoto Prefecture, Osaka Prefecture and Hyogo Prefecture. Hiyoshi Dam includes a small hydroelectric power generator with a capacity of 850 kW. The energy is used to power the dam facilities, with the excess generation sold to the grid.

Located around north of Adelaide and about inland, it has been identified as the oldest known site of human habitation in inland Australia. Newspapers reported that this rock shelter was discovered by chance in 2011 by a local resident who stumbled upon it while looking for somewhere to go to the toilet. Researchers found thousands of artefacts and bone fragments, which enabled them to date the shelter's occupation to a number of periods between 49,000 and 10,000 years ago. The finds include the earliest evidence in Australia of the development of bone and stone-axe technology, the use of ochre, and interaction with megafauna such as Diprotodon. Discovery The site is located in the ancestral lands of the Adnyamathanha, an Indigenous Australian people. It lies in a gorge at the southern end of the Lake Eyre basin in the northern Flinders Ranges. Its discovery came about by chance during an exploratory trip into the Flinders Range by Clifford Coulthard, an Adnyamathanha elder, and Giles Hamm, an archaeologist from La Trobe University. While Coulthard was searching for a place to go to the toilet, the two men found a spring surrounded by rock art and a soot-blackened fissure in the rock nearby. They realised immediately that the soot indicated that the fissure had been used as a shelter where fires had been lit. The fissure is located about above a creek bed. It is approximately wide and extends to a depth of about . Finds Between 2011 and 2014, a team of researchers led by Hamm excavated the shelter to a depth of . They found over 4,300 artefacts including bone fragments from sixteen species of mammal and one reptile, as well as eggs from emus and an extinct giant bird, Genyornis newtoni. The animal remains included bones from the extinct Diprotodon, a wombat-like creature the size of a rhinoceros, which had probably been killed and brought to the shelter to be cooked and eaten. Most of the of bones discovered were probably from a single species, the yellow-footed rock-wallaby. The artefacts included pieces of gypsum pigment, hafted and stone tools, and bone needles including the oldest bone tool so far found in Australia. The shelter also provided evidence of the earliest known ochre usage in Australia and south- east Asia. Fragments of fibrous plant material found at the site may be the remains of nets, which the occupants may have used to catch the fast-moving wallabies. Analysis Dating was carried out through a combination of stratigraphy (analysing the depth of artefacts), carbon dating of organic artefacts and the use of single-grain optically stimulated luminescence to date quartz grains. This revealed that the shelter had been used in a number of phases over tens of thousands of years, with the earliest evidence of habitation 49,000 years ago. It appears to have been used particularly intensively about 40,000 years ago, but usage declined around 35,000‚Äì24,000 years ago during a period of extreme aridity in South Australia. Another relatively intensive period of usage occurred from around 17,000 years ago, with the last evidence of usage dating to around 10,000 years before the present day. The discoveries have shed new light on the human colonisation of Australia by the ancestors of today's Indigenous Australians. The first Australians are thought to have migrated by boat to northern Australia about 50,000 years ago. They then spread all the way around the coasts of the continent within possibly as little as 2,000 years. It had previously been thought that they took much longer to diffuse into Australia's arid interior, as the next earliest known evidence of interior settlement, at Puritjarra in western central Australia, is dated to 11,000 years after the oldest of the Warratyi finds. However, the discoveries at Warratyi suggest that the interior diffusion happened much earlier than that. It is possible that humans migrated into the interior at a very early date by following river systems and settled around inland springs such as the one at Warratyi.

On 24 July 1999, the Bandierante carrying 17 people consisting of 15 passengers and 2 crews crashed into a mountain near Delailasakau while en route to Nadi. Accident The Bandeirante took off from Nausori with 17 passengers and crews. The aircraft was carrying nine Fijians, five Australians, one New Zealander, one Chinese and one Japanese. 15 minutes after take off from Nausori International Airport, the aircraft slammed into the mountainside near Delailasakau, shortly after dawn. Radio contact was lost with the aircraft. At about 08:40 or twenty minutes to nine, police had a call from the radio telephone operator from Windina to say that they heard a loud crash out in the hills, north of Nasevou village. Witnesses stated that they saw the aircraft was flying low, and shortly after slammed into the mountainside. One man stated that he heard a \\"cannonball\\" during the crash. He then saw parts from the tail fall down. A search team was dispatched by the authorities. Shortly after, a helicopter spotted the wreckage of Flight 121. There were no signs of life on the crash site. Most bodies were severely mutilated, with witnesses describing many internal organs spread throughout the crash site. The area of the crash site was a remote area, forcing the rescuers to evacuate the bodies only by foot. The crash site is about six hours' walk from the nearest village, with few roads and no telephone links. Police operations director Jahir Khan said police would try to remove the bodies by 25 July. Lack of equipment hampered the evacuation process and several bodies were trapped in the wreckage had to be evacuated by cutting and removing the wreckage from the area. Aircraft The aircraft involved in the crash was an Embraer EMB 110 Bandeirante (Serial Number 110416) registered in Fiji as DQ-AFN. Powered by two Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6A-34 turboprop engines, the aircraft was first flown in 1983 and had flown a total of 22411 cycles. The aircraft was registered in America and Australia prior to being operated by Air Fiji. Investigation The Civil Aviation Authority of Fiji (CAAF) investigated the crash of Flight 121, with assistance from the Australian Transport Safety Bureau. Interviews conducted by the CAAF found that witnesses stated that before the aircraft crashed, parts of its tail and wings fell down onto the forest, indicating a possible structural failure. The tail fin and horizontal stabilisers were found to the left of the line of flight. This was consistent with a pre-impact structural failure, meaning that the aircraft may have broken up in the air before crashing to the ground. Specific investigations later found that the pilot of Flight 121 may have been intoxicated. The brother of the pilot stated that four hours before the crash the captain of the flight had been drinking alcohol. The investigation also revealed that the captain had insufficient rest prior to the flight and that he had consumed an above-therapeutic level of antihistamine prior to the flight. Air Fiji's Standard Operating Procedure was also found to be inadequate. The structural failure that occurred in flight was a result from the crew's error in descending below the Minimum Descent Altitude of . The right wing struck a ridge at an elevation of , the aircraft then broke up and impacted the slope of a ridge further on. The tail section and right wing were found from the main wreckage.

Galerie Kornfeld is a privately owned Swiss auction house in Berne and one of the leading auction houses in Switzerland in the fields of Modern Art (paintings, drawings, prints and sculptures) as well as Old Master prints and drawings.  History  View from the garden Heinrich Georg Gutekunst opened his gallery for Old and Modern Art in Stuttgart on 1 October 1864 and established the basis for a tradition, which remains unbroken until today and to which, since 1919 in Berne, the vital activities of Galerie Kornfeld can be traced back. The first auction series took place in Stuttgart from 1868 to 1914. His son Richard Gutekunst opened a gallery in 1895 under the name Richard Gutekunst. When HG Gutekunst retired in 1910 Wilhelm A. Gaiser took over the firm until 1914. After the World War I Richard Gutekunst reopened the gallery in Berne together with August Klipstein. Richard Gutekunst retired in 1934 and Eberhard W. Kornfeld took over when August Klipstein died in 1951. The gallery‚Äôs name changed from Klipstein & Kornfeld, to Kornfeld & Klipstein and finally to Galerie Kornfeld.  Locations  Galerie Kornfeld has its headquarters in the historic Villa Thurmau at Laupenstrasse 41 in Berne. The large sales room pavilion which can accommodate more than 300 auction guests is embedded in a garden laid out in the middle of the nineteenth century. The Zurich office lays in an old villa at Titlisstrasse 48.  Activities = Sales  Galerie Kornfeld holds annual auction sales over several days in June to coincide with ART Basel, a lively social event which attracts collectors, museum curators and art lovers from all over the world. Specialist areas include Modern Art, Old Master Prints, Swiss Art and Contemporary Art. The Galerie also works throughout the year as a classic art gallery and dealer's. Usually in autumn and winter up to three exhibitions are organised on the premises.  Publishing  The experts at Galerie Kornfeld also work on publishing comprehensive catalogues raisonn√© of renowned artists like Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, Max Beckmann, Paul Klee, K√§the Kollwitz, Paul Gauguin, Pablo Picasso and Alberto Giacometti.  Managing Partners  :Eberhard W. Kornfeld :Christine E. Stauffer :Bernhard U.

Location  The bay of K√∂nigshafen lies north of the Sylt coastal resort of List and southeast of the promontory of , the northernmost point of Germany, on which stand the lighthouses of and , the two northernmost buildings in Germany. The bay has an area of roughly 4.2 km¬≤ and opens towards the east onto the Wadden Sea; it is only separated from the open North Sea to the west by a spit which is just 300 metres wide. In the K√∂nigshafen lie the small uninhabited island of Uth√∂rn with its bird reserve, and the Lister Haken.  History  The natural harbour formed by the bight was valued in the past as a safe haven on the North Sea coast. In the Middle Ages, it was the most important port-of-call between the Danish town of Skagen to the north and the mouth of the River Elbe to the south Thus, for centuries, the Danish kings held Listland as a royal enclave. However, according to contemporary accounts, the K√∂nigshafen began to silt up in the 18th century and became unusable for shipping. Until the mid-1980s NATO conducted regular air-to-ground firing exercises in the area.

Greek text Metiochus and Parthenope is similar in style to Chariton's Chaereas and Callirhoe, from the first century BC or AD, and so is presumed to be equally old,Cf. Thomas H√§gg, 'The Oriental Reception of Greek Novels: A Survey with Some Preliminary Considerations', Symbolae Osloenses, 61 (1986), 99-131 (p. 106), . making it one of the first prose novels in the Western literary tradition.Thomas H√§gg and Bo Utas, The Virgin and her Lover: Fragments of an Ancient Greek Novel and a Persian Epic Poem, Brill Studies in Middle Eastern Literatures, 30 (Leiden: Brill, 2003), p. 1. The text survives only in small fragments of papyrus from Egypt, but references in Greek literature of the Roman period, a Syrian mosaic of c. 200 depicting the protagonists, and another from Zeugma, Commagene, shows the story's continued importance during the Roman period.Thomas H√§gg and Bo Utas, The Virgin and her Lover: Fragments of an Ancient Greek Novel and a Persian Epic Poem, Brill Studies in Middle Eastern Literatures, 30 (Leiden: Brill, 2003), pp. 1-7. Drawing on surviving sources, H√§gg and Utan reconstruct the following plot. The story refers to historical figures, but is anachronistic and fundamentally fictional. Metiochus is the eldest son of Miltiades. However, his stepmother Hegesipyle plots against him in favour of her own children. So, along with his friend Theophanes, he flees his home (on the Thracian Chersonese), seeking the court of his distant relative Polycrates on Samos. There he meets Polycrates's daughter Parthenope at the temple of Hera. They fall instantly in love. Polycrates invites Metiochus to a symposium, and the discussions on love at this event are the main surviving part of the Greek text.Thomas H√§gg and Bo Utan, 'Eros Goes East: Parthenope the Virgin Meets VƒÅmiq the Ardent Lover', in Plotting with Eros: Essays on the Poetics of Love and the Erotics of Reading, ed. by Ingela Nilsson (Copenhagen: Museum Tusculanum Press, 2009), pp. 153-86 (pp. 155-56). Persian text For centuries, it was known that ‚ÄòUn·π£urƒ´ had composed a poem called VƒÅmiq u ‚ÄòAdhrƒÅ, but it was thought lost. In the 1950s, however, the Pakistani scholar Mohammad Shafi identified fragments of the text in the binding of a theological manuscript produced in Herat in AH 526 (1132 AD),A. A. Seyed-Gohrab, Courtly Riddles: Enigmatic Embellishments in Early Persian Poetry (Leiden: Leiden University Press, 2010), p. 71 n. 2. revealing 380 couplets (abyƒÅt) of the poem. Another 151 couplets are quoted in Persian lexical works, some or all of which may come from this poem.Thomas H√§gg and Bo Utas, The Virgin and her Lover: Fragments of an Ancient Greek Novel and a Persian Epic Poem, Brill Studies in Middle Eastern Literatures, 30 (Leiden: Brill, 2003), p. 2. VƒÅmiq means 'the lover' and ‚ÄòAdhrƒÅ means 'virgin' in Arabic (corresponding to the connotations of virginity in the name Parthenope, from Greek parthenos 'young girl, virgin'), but many other names in ‚ÄòUn·π£urƒ´'s text are transposed from the Greek, demonstrating derivation from Metiochus and Parthenope, probably via an Arabic translation. In the tenth century, Ibn al-Nadƒ´m records that Sahl b. HƒÅr≈´n (d. 830 AD), secretary to Caliph al-Ma'm≈´n in Baghdad, composed a work of the same title. This must derive from the Greek text, whether by direct translation or through an intermediary ‚Äî conceivably even an earlier Persian translation. Meanwhile al-Bƒ´r≈´nƒ´ (d. c. 1051) claimed to have translated an Arabic work of this name into New Persian. Al-Bƒ´r≈´nƒ´'s text might, then, have been the source for ‚ÄòUn·π£urƒ´'s poem.Thomas H√§gg, 'The Oriental Reception of Greek Novels: A Survey with Some Preliminary Considerations', Symbolae Osloenses, 61 (1986), 99-131 (pp. 107-8), .

It was first described to science by American malacologist Timothy Abbott Conrad in 1837.. The type specimen was collected in San Diego by Thomas Nuttall. Fossils of Modiolus capax have been found in Miocene epoch deposits, suggesting that this species is between 5.3 and 20.4 million years old. Description Modiolus capex, showing exterior of the valves with periostracum partially removed Shells of Modiolus capax can reach a length of about , a width of about and a diameter of about .Sol Felty Light, James T. Carlton The Light and Smith Manual: Intertidal Invertebrates from Central California .to Peru Individuals may weigh up to . This species has a quite variable form, but it always shows serrate hairs on the periostracum. The left valve is more inflated than the right one. The external surface of the shell is blue to bright orange brown, while the inside is reddish-violet on the posterior half. Distribution This species is present in Santa Cruz, California, to Playa, Peru and in Galapagos Islands. It is found throughout the Gulf of California. Fat horsemussels live is shallow water from the intertidal zone to 25 fathoms. They live on rocks, boulders, and pebbles on the sea bottom and attached to wood pilings. Occasionally they can be found partially buried in mud.  Life history  Fat horse mussels are gonochoric, that is to say that there are two sexes and each individual is either male or female. The reproduce by broadcast spawning, by releasing gametes into the sea where fertilization takes place. In laboratory conditions, a free-swimming veliger develops about 24 hours after fertilization, which develops an umbo about four days later. The pediveliger stage is reach in 10 to 12 days, at which point the animal is long. Settlement to the bottom takes place 3 to 4 days later. This species is a filter feeder, drawing seawater into its body where it filters out nutrients. It then ejects excess water and waste products into the sea.  Human consumption  Local consumption of fat horsemussels takes place in coastal communities. The cultivation of Modiolus capax in aquaculture has been studied since the 1980's. Among the findings were that this species does not readily settle on the artificial substrates used by the industry and that it is relatively slow-growing. Consequently, this species is among the least promising for aquaculture. References * Coan, E. V.; Valentich-Scott, P. (2012). Bivalve seashells of tropical West America.

However, their meeting is cut short when they are interrupted by the arrival of an unknown gunman. Frank is shot dead, and Nancy receives a wound from a ricochet. The Brighton CID of East Sussex Police are assigned to investigate the case. Boss DCI Michelle Newman (Lindsey Coulson) arranges for DS Devlin to be assigned to the case, unaware of her being present at the scene of the murder. Devlin is initially paired with DS Sean 'Gunner' Martin (Noel Clarke), but friction occurs between the pair, forcing Newman to second Nancy's fellow NCD detective Kevin O'Dowd (Rob James- Collier) to the case. Nancy struggles to hide her involvement in Frank's activities. Her friendship with Frank's daughter, Hayley (Laura Haddock) makes her situation increasingly difficult. However, it soon transpires that the blight of the team's investigation appears to a mole within their ranks. Nancy suspects that Gunner may be the leak, but during a late-night visit to O'Dowd's hotel room, she discovers a series of surveillance photos that disappeared earlier in the day. Whilst trying to deal with the pressures of the investigation, Nancy is forced to help her mentally ill mother, Teresa (Suzanne Packer), but soon discovers that her mum has been shielding a life- changing secret for twenty years - that Nancy is secretly Frank's daughter.

The rhinophores are black with pink bases and the oral tentacles are pale grey, sometimes streaked with black. The dorsal surface of the body is black, with pink, grey, greenish or bluish tubercles forming longitudinal rows. The front- most tubercles are set obliquely, sloping towards the centre of the back. The ventral surface is a uniform pale grey.  Distribution  Phyllidiella striata occurs in the tropical central and western Pacific Ocean and the Indian Ocean, at depths down to about . This species was first described from the Philippines. This name is often erroneously used for Phyllidiopsis xishaensis.Yonow N.

[22 May 2012], available online at https://dx.doi.org/10.3897/zookeys.197.1728 Ecology This species feeds on sponges. It has neither a radula, jaws, or a stomach, and feeds by turning part of its gut inside out, using its digestive enzymes to break down the sponge's tissues, and sucking in the liquified product. Like other nudibranchs, Phyllidiella striata is a hermaphrodite. The genital pore is on the right-hand side of the foot just behind the head. A pair of individuals move close to each other while facing in opposite directions, and transfer sperm to each other. Each is then able to produce eggs. There is no larval stage and the embryos undergo direct development into juveniles. This species exudes a milky-white substance containing terpenes from its dorsal gland; this is derived from toxic substances in the sponge it feeds on and acts to deter predators.

There are three ways to destroy hoppers: attacking directly, building and manning a defense post, and capturing one hopper to attack another. Before each attack, Space Dude must evade missiles or alien creatures to get to the attack point. During each attack, Space Dude is required to blast a Hopper multiple times to destroy it. In direct attacks against Hoppers, Space Dude surfs toward the enemy, lobbing bombs at it and avoiding contact. Once the hero passes the Hopper, it will fire a barrage of shots at him until he turns around. These attacks and counterattacks last until either the Hopper or Space Dude is defeated. When Space Dude builds a defense post, he must haul the building materials to the site while dodging missiles from the Dorf mothership. If the dude can make it to the defense site without being hit by missiles, then he builds the defense post at 100 percent strength. If missiles hit Space Dude in transit, he loses materials and the defense post loses strength. After building the defense post, Space Dude must man the gun and attack the nearest Hopper. Destroying a Hopper typically requires between 20 and 30 shots. When Space Dude attempts to capture a Hopper, he must break into the machine and destroy the Dorfs inside. Once he dispatches them, the dude can control the Hopper and use it to attack other Hoppers nearby. Finally, Space Dude can choose to attack King Dorf in the mothership to end the siege. Once inside the mothership, Space Dude must destroy guards to get the king's inner chamber. Once inside the king's lair, Space Dude must hit him dozens of times to defeat him. If Space Dude fails, he will need to attack the mothership again, but King Dorf does not regain strength, so the number of shots necessary to destroy him will remain at the number where Space Dude left off. Whenever Space Dude loses a battle, he must return to the Golden City to recover. During this recovery time, Hoppers can advance on the city. Once a Hopper reaches the city, it launches missiles and sets the city ablaze. When that happens, Space Dude is sent flying back into space and the game restarts.  Gameplay  In Space Dude, the player has to complete mini-games, in which the player character has to dodge things or shoot. The player can choose their missions with a choice of either repairing defense guns, capturing Hoppers and going to attack.  Reception  A reviewer for Next Generation criticized the game's lack of a save feature and scored it one out of five stars. Adrenaline Vault said it was a good game for little children.

Biography = Career  A former student of the √âcole normale sup√©rieure, agr√©g√© d'histoire and a member of the √âcole fran√ßaise de Rome from 1957 to 1959, he was a professor of ancient history at the University of Tunis, Caen University then de Paris-I Panth√©on-Sorbonne, and emeritus director of studies from 1997 at the √âcole pratique des hautes √©tudes. Elected a member of the Acad√©mie des inscriptions et belles-lettres in 1986, he was director of the √âcole fran√ßaise de Rome from 1992 to 1995.  Ministerial advisor  He made a short political career as a member of Pierre Mend√®s France's cabinet in 1956. He was secretary, then editor-in- chief of the Cahiers de la R√©publique, and assigned to the office of Jean-Pierre Chev√®nement, between 1984 and 2002, on civic education. He showed anxiety throughout his life to articulate his republican commitment and his career as a historian. This contributed to the originality of his work, straddling between ancient Rome and contemporary times, especially around the functioning of society and political institutions. As Catherine Virlouvet pointed out, \\"it is the same questioning that unites Le m√©tier de citoyen dans la Rome antique (1976) and L'id√©e r√©publicaine en France.Catherine Virlouvet, L'Histoire n¬∞364, May 2011,  The republican idea in France  According to C√©line Spector, Nicolet's work L'id√©e r√©publicaine en France (1982) contributed to the return of the Republican idea in the 1980s. According to him, it was Rousseau who provided the theoretical basis for the notion of a republic as it is understood in France. In particular, it resumed its concept of sovereignty and its theory of law to the citizen of Geneva.

It has smooth, powdery white bark, lance-shaped to curved adult leaves mostly arranged in opposite pairs, flower buds in groups of seven, white to pale yellow flowers and pendulous, more or less spherical fruit.flower budsfruit Description Eucalyptus doratoxylon is a mallee, rarely a small tree, that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. It has smooth, powdery white over reddish or greenish bark. Young plants and coppice regrowth have narrow elliptic to narrow lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in opposite pairs, long and wide. Adult leaves are also usually arranged in opposite pairs, glossy green, long and wide on a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in groups of seven in leaf axils on an unbranched peduncle long, the individual buds on a pedicel long. Mature buds are pear-shaped to oval, creamy white, long and wide with a beaked operculum. Flowering occurs between August and March and the flowers are white to pale yellow. The fruit is a pendulous, woody, more or less spherical capsule long and wide with the valves near rim level. Taxonomy Eucalyptus doratoxylon was first formally described in 1860 by the botanist Ferdinand von Mueller in Fragmenta Phytographiae Australiae from samples collected by George Maxwell in the Kojoneerup district. The specific epithet is (doratoxylon) is derived from the Ancient Greek words dory, doratos meaning \\"spear\\" and xylon meaning \\"wood\\", possibly in reference to the use of the stems for spears. Distribution Spearwood mallee grows in sandy loam or white-grey sandy soils in heath and open forest on hills and around granite outcrops along the south coast in the Esperance Plains, Jarrah Forest and Mallee biogeographic regions of Western Australia. Conservation status Eucalyptus doratoxylon is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife Noongar Uses Noongars used the branches to make spears: the bends in the branch were straightened over fire and the tips were sharpened using a chert flake. As with all other Eucalypts in the south-western region of Western Australia, the leaves of this species were crushed to make antibacterial poultices for wounds. They were also crushed and steamed to relieve nasal congestion. The gum was used after grinding, to make an ointment for sores, and also taken orally as a treatment for dysentery.

The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2015. History This area was once part of a ribbon farm along the Rouge River. In 1914, Gustav Zanger purchased the property with the intent of transferring ownership to the Detroit Zoo. When the zoo decided to establish itself in Royal Oak instead, Henry Ford offered to buy the property. The property was sold to Ford in 1927. Ford donated the land to the Ford Foundation, and in 1938 the foundation decided to develop the land in to a residential subdivision. The entire area and divided into five separate subdivisions and designed as a unit. The first subdivision, including the shopping center at the southeast corner of the neighborhood, was platted in 1939. Development was underway in the first subdivision by 1940, and the second was platted. The third and fourth followed in 1941, and by the advent of World War II 60% of the lots had been developed. Immediately after the war another 30% were developed, and the final ten percent of houses were constructed between 1960 and 1988. The fifth area was never platted, and is not included in this historic district. It was eventually sold and developed as an upscale golf course community. Description Streetscape Houses The Springwells Park neighborhood is platted into lots along gently curving streets that follow the terrain, with numerous cul-de-sacs. Mature trees are located throughout the neighborhood, and interior parks located in the center of the blocks. Structures in the district include single family homes, duplexes, townhouses, and terrace apartment houses, as well as a shopping center. Structures all share Colonial Revival design elements and similar exterior materials. There are four hundred four contributing houses and duplexes in the neighborhood (and eight noncontributing houses), fifteen contributing apartment buildings (and twenty non-contributing apartment buildings) a shopping center with a two contributing, and two non-contributing buildings, and seven contributing parks. The shopping center is located at the southeast corner of the district, and the contributing apartment buildings are located to the west of the shopping center on the south portion of the district. Parks are equally spaced throughout the neighborhood; all but one (Bennington Park) are on the interior of the blocks. Each individual house is unique, but all of the houses and duplexes are one, one-and-a-half, or two stories tall. All have Colonial Revival details and gable roofs. Exterior materials include brick, stone, clapboard, and combinations thereof. Most garages are attached, except in the northern sections of the neighborhood. The single-family house types include one-and-a-half-story Cape Cods, two-story center entrance, one-and-half-story cottages, and one-story ranch houses. The duplexes are located in the north section of the neighborhood. Like the single-family homes, the duplexes vary in form but are constructed in similar styles and using similar materials. Many are two-story brick-clad houses, some with gable fronts; others have clapboard on the second floors or large projecting bays. The townhouse buildings are all similar, with adjacent portions of the buildings alternately set forward and recessed. All have two-story red brick walls and hip roofs covered with concrete tiles. The terrace apartment buildings are U-shaped, with center entrances and cupolas on top.

Note that Bulkley is spelled as \\"Buckley\\" here. Edward Bulkley (died 10 August 1714) was an East India Company surgeon (1602-1709) posted in Madras and a pioneer naturalist. He corresponded with James Petiver and was the first to document the bird species of which a list of birds was published by John Ray. Ray incorrectly notes him as \\"Buckley\\". Bulkley also studied the local plants and corresponded with the Jesuit botanist Georg Joseph Kamel and acted as an intermediary between Kamel and Petiver. Bulkley corresponded with Charles du Bois on plants and collected Tamil and Telugu names for many medicinal and economically useful plants. Surgeon Bulkley is credited with conducting the first post-mortem in India. The case involved the death of James Wheeler in 1693 and the only previous such examination was in November 1680 when a soldier, Joshua Adams was killed by a strike on the head by Daniel Hughes. An examination of just the scalp was made but Bulkley's was the first case where a complete autopsy was carried out. James Wheeler was a member of the Council of Madras and had been treated by the physician Samuel Browne whose assistant had used a pestle-and-mortar, suspected to have been used earlier for arsenic, to grind pearls as medication. Bulkley determined from the autopsy that it was not arsenic poisoning as suspected and Browne was acquitted. Bulkley was a correspondent of several naturalists in England and maintained correspondence with Petiver after the death of Browne who had previously supplied natural history specimens. Bulkley sent samples of soils from India to J. Woodward who included them in his 1729 catalogue. Birds about Fort St. George, one of the earliest illustrated account of the birds of India. The drawings were made by an Indian artist, the coloured originals are in the British Library. Edward Bulkley also served as a Member of the Council of Madras and as a Paymaster. He resigned from work due to ill health in February 1713. He was buried in his garden in Peddanaikpetta, now in the Army lines opposite the Madras Medical College. The inscription on his tomb reads Sacrum sit hoc monumentum perenni memoriae Edwardi Bulkley, Honorabili Anglorum Societati medici, feliciter experti et ipsae tandema consiliis, qui cum naturae arcana diu indagasset, laeto animo ipsae satisfecit viii. Augusti MDCCXIV, et anno aetatis suae climacterico. Ne mireris viator quod in horto ubi animum perpoliebat, corpus suum voluit reponi, beatam sperans ressurectionem.

It was written by Irving Berlin. Berlin originally wrote the song Let's Take an Old-Fashioned Walk for the scene but the film's producer, Arthur Freed, convinced Berlin to change this for a song that would highlight Garland's comedic talent. Berlin wrote the song in about an hour drawing on his experience as a Tin Pan Alley popular songwriter.  Description  The film is set in 1912 in the New York Broadway Vaudeville business in which hobo acts depicting down and outs were popular with audiences. Astaire and Garland appear as tramps in worn out clothing cast off by the very rich. A swell is slang for a wealthy, elegant person. The song and dance explores the fantasy that they really are wealthy and have been invited for tea with the extremely wealthy Vanderbilt family. They have the invitation but no means of getting to the appointment. The song lyrics suggest ways they might travel up the Avenue, (most likely the opulent Fifth Avenue on which the Vanderbilts had 10 mansions), to the club where the Vanderbilts are waiting. These are: to drive a car, skate on ice, ride on a bicycle, sail a yacht, drive a carriage, ride on a trolley car, or swim. All are rejected with a reason and the only way left to the two tramps is to walk up the Avenue. The song verses close with the refrain:- > So we'll walk up the avenue > Yes we'll walk up the avenue > And to walk up the avenue's what we like Verses in the song also satirize aspects of the lifestyle of the rich; 'sports' who play tennis all summer, Wall Street bankers who are too drunk to find the key to the safe, and wealthy playboys who are adored and chased by photographic models.

They were also present at what is the world-heritage fossil site of Riversleigh, Gregory Downs, and Mount Margaret. Their northern boundaries reached up to Lawn Hill Creek and Punjaub.

Language The Waanyi language, now moribund, had some 10 speakers in 1981, mainly to the west of Doomadgee. It is classified as one of the Garrwan languages. Country The Waanyi territory was in well-watered limestone and sandstone country, including parts of the Gregory River. In Norman Tindale's estimation, the Waanyi held about of territory, extending from the vicinity of the south of the upper Nicholson River, west of Corinda, and at Spring and Lawn Hill creeks. Their eastern extension lay at the Barkly (Barclay) River, Lawn Hill and Bannockburn. Their western frontier was at Old Benmara, and southwest they roamed as far as Mount Morgan. They lay south of the Kunindiri and Garrwa people, west of the Injilarija and Nguburinji tribes, and east of the Wambaya and Wakaya tribes. History The whole area of the north was affected deeply by the pastoral boom opened up in 1881 in the Northern Territory, with massive stations under the control of a few eastern investors hastily stocked with cattle: the key watering sites were locked out, tribes were shot at sight, and many groups moved east into the Gulf of Carpentaria, where the same phenomenon repeated itself. The Waanyi and the Garrwa, like many tribes local to the area that found their lands taken over for pastoral leases and resisted dispossession, found themselves threatened. The Eastern Waanyi were wiped out: settler vigilantes and police magistrates employed native mounted troopers to ambush, murder and massacre any aboriginal groups they came across. The lessees of Gregory Downs submitted testimony in 1880 that the police rounded up blacks and then shot them, while that of Lawn Hill fived years later said that on his cattle run alone police had shot over a hundred blacks in three years, without achieving their aim of stopping the killing of livestock. The displaced Waanyi eventually took over the territory in the Lawn Hill area of the extinct Injilarija. Native title The Waanyi first lodged a native title claim over an area known to them traditionally as Wugujaji in June 1994. Under a Queensland Government land act of 1989, CZL was granted two mining leases covering 23,585 hectares extending through Waanyi land the Century Mine was established on it. Eventually the terms of a settlement were agreed on, and CZL paid funding, training and employment to the traditional peoples, an accord known as the $90 million offer. The Waanyi claim a right to co-manage both the Boodjamulla National Park and Riversleigh, the latter holding the richest Oligocene and Miocene mammalian and reptile fossil field in the world.

He recorded several albums under his own name during the period 1994‚Äì2006. He has also recorded as a sideman, including on trumpeter Wynton Marsalis' Blood on the Fields. Stewart went on multiple national and world tours during his 30-year career as a performer, both under his own name and with the Marsalis band.  Early life  Stewart was born in Oakland, California. His mother was from Louisiana, and his biological father, Bob Stewart, was a San Francisco Conservatory trained flutist and trumpeter. Stewart says that his mother began teaching him to read from the Qur'an when he was three years old; the Bible was his next reading task, and he went on to study other major religions.Moody, Shelah (2004), \\"Up Close & Personal with Robert Stewart\\". City Flight Magazine. Stewart first played the flute as a hobby; his primary passion was basketball during his grade school years.The Santa Clara Metro, \\"Young Man With A Hot Horn,\\" by Nicky Baxter, June 1995 He stated that he \\"played flute in high school because it was easy to hide from my friends who were all into sports\\".Kohlhaase, Bill (January 31, 1995) \\"A Young Saxman Gets Sound Advice from Jazz Giants\\". Los Angeles Times. His high school music teacher encouraged him to play jazz. The summer after his graduation from Fremont High School, he was listening to the radio and heard tenor saxophonist John Coltrane playing \\"Russian Lullaby\\"; the next song was \\"All Too Soon\\" played by tenor saxophonist Ben Webster.\\"May The Force Be With You\\", Rasputin's Manifesto, May 1998, pp. 47‚Äì48. The contrast in sound between these two men, playing the same instrument, fascinated Stewart; he then remembered his high school teacher's words and focused on jazz. After the summer of 1986, Stewart began to frequent jam sessions with Oakland Bay Area pianist Ed Kelly. There he met saxophonist Pharoah Sanders, who became his first mentor, giving him technical advice and encouraging him to continue and advance his playing.  Performance career  Stewart playing in Italy. In New York, Stewart played with trumpeter Roy Hargrove.Merod, Jim (June 1994) \\"Stray Horns\\". Jazz Now, p. 15. In 1991, he performed with drummer Max Roach's ensemble.McDonald, Mac (May 1995), \\"The Future Of Jazz\\", The Monterey County Herald. In 1992, Stewart performed with McCoy Tyner (piano), Bobby Hutcherson (vibes), Freddie Hubbard (trumpet), Milt Jackson (vibes), Billy Higgins (drums), and organist Jimmy Smith.Bird, Rick (1994), \\"Hot West Coast Sax Phenom Playing at Greenwich Tavern\\", The Cincinnati Post. Stewart also joined the Los Angeles-based group Black-Note for an eight-month stint, and performed with trombonist Delfeayo Marsalis and drummer Brian Blade that same year.Gilbert, Andrew (1994), \\"The Record Bin,\\" LA Village View. Others he had played with by 1995 include Buddy Montgomery, Chico Freeman, and Donald Byrd. Jazz critic Jason Ankeny said that Stewart was \\"One of the most impressive hard bop tenor saxophonists to emerge during the 1990s\\". In 1993, Stewart was asked to tour with the New York-based group The Harper Brothers led by drummer Winard Harper. This was his first national band tour.Goodwin, Elizabeth (February 1995), \\"Youth In Jazz: Robert Stewart,\\" Jazz Now Magazine. By the end of 1994, he began touring nationally under his own name.Daye, John (April 1994), \\"All That Jazz\\", The New York Beacon. Stewart's highest profile engagement that year came after joining trumpeter Wynton Marsalis' big band, the Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra, to perform Blood on the Fields, including on the recording that won the Pulitzer Prize for Music. He also performed on the album They Came to Swing. He was part of the Blood on the Fields tour of the United States and Europe in 1997. In 1997, Stewart played weekly at San Francisco venues such as Club Deluxe and Bruno's,Gilbert, Andrew (August 3, 1997) \\"Saxophonist Busy Over All That Jazz\\". San Francisco Chronicle and Examiner. and had a gig with vocalist Jon Hendricks doing a Bread and Roses benefit inside the former Alcatraz Island Federal Penitentiary. In June 1997, Stewart's quartet included drummer Billy Higgins for a concert at The Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles.Kohlhasse, Bill (May 30, 1997), \\"Museums Draw On Palette of Acts in Summer\\". Los Angeles Times. The previous year, Higgins was reported as saying that Stewart was \\"perhaps the most important young artist to come along in decades.\\"Kline, Randall, 1996 San Francisco Jazz Festival Official Program Book. Stewart performed with guitarist Patrick Greene for President Bill Clinton and First Lady Hillary Clinton at a Democratic fundraiser in Woodside, California in 1998.Hildebrand, Lee (July 1998), \\"Robert Rules,\\" The East Bay Express. He backed up Dizzy Gillespie in one of Gillespie's final concerts. In his 30-year performance career he toured the world multiple times.  Recording career  Stewart's first album as leader was Judgement, for World Stage Records. The recording featured Higgins, pianist Eric Reed, and bassist Mark Shelby. Jazz writer Scott Yanow wrote: \\"Even on the up-tempo tunes, Stewart is often content to emphasize his warm tone and to hold long notes, taking his time to get his message across. [...] this is a pleasing modern mainstream effort.\\" In 1994, Stewart recorded Beautiful Love Ballads for Red Records of Italy; it was released in 1998. Stewart's first album for Quincy Jones's Qwest Records was In the Gutta, in 1996. Saxophonist Dave Liebman, on hearing it, reported enthusiastically that Stewart sounded like a player from an older generation.Primack, Bret (June 1996) \\"Before and After\\". JazzTimes. p. 59. Stewart's next album with Qwest was The Force, with drummer Jeff \\"Tain\\" Watts, bassist Reginald Veal, and pianist Ed Kelly (his first teacher).Elwood, Philip (April 18, 1998) \\"Sax and Flute with a Spiritual Bent\\". San Francisco Examiner. According to Stewart, Qwest delayed its release for almost two years and then did not promote it, because of its Islamic influences. In 2000, Stewart recorded Nat the Cat, a tribute to Nat \\"King\\" Cole that featured Kelly (piano), Mark Williams (bass), Sly Randolph (drums), and family members Kevin Stewart (piano) and Robert Stewart III (flute). Stewart's 2003 album The Movement was a concert recording that was also Higgins's final recording. In 2003, Stewart recorded Heaven and Earth for Nagel-Heyer Records. This was essentially a smooth jazz record, and several of the thirteen songs were Stewart originals. The AllMusic reviewer stated that there is \\"a positive social message that runs through the songs [...] Perhaps Stewart has found a way to combine new age politics with new age music, creating a hybrid that seems almost natural.\\" Post-performance career Stewart retired from recording and performing at the end of 2016 in order to write religious books, teach, and travel.

She showed some promise as a juvenile in 2012 when winning on her debut. In the following spring she won the Grade II Fillies' Revue and rebounded from a poor run in the Oka Sho to win the Grade I Yushun Himba. She returned in the autumn to win the Shuka Sho before defeating older fillies and mares in the Queen Elizabeth II Commemorative Cup. She won the JRA Award for Best Three- Year-Old Filly of 2013. She stayed in training for three more seasons but failed to win again. Background Meisho Mambo is a bay mare with a white sock on her right hind leg bred in Japan by Kosho Bokujo, the breeding farm of her owner Yoshio Matsumoto. She was sent into training with Akihiro Iida and was ridden in most of her races by Koshiro Take. In her races Meisho Mambo usually wore a hood in the blue and pink colours of her owner. She was sired by Suzuka Mambo (a son of Sunday Silence) who recorded his biggest win in the spring edition of the 2005 Tenno Sho. The best of his other runners has been the Champions Cup winner Sambista. Meisho Mambo's dam Meisho Momoka showed no racing ability, failing to win or place in twelve starts. She was a female- line descendant of Dianne K, an American broodmare who was imported to Japan in the 1950s. Racing career=2012: two-year-old season On 25 November Meisho Mambo made a successful racecourse debut when she won an event for previously unraced juveniles over 1400 metres at Kyoto Racecourse. She was the stepped up sharply in class for Japan's most prestigious race for two-year-old fillies, the Grade I Hanshin Juvenile Fillies over 1600 metres at Hanshin Racecourse in December and finished tenth of the eighteen runners, six lengths behind the winner Robe Tissage. 2013: three-year-old seasonSpring= Meisho Mambo began her second season by finishing second to Red Oval over 1400 metres at Kyoto in January and then won a minor race over 1600 metres at the same track on 16 February. On 10 March she moved back up in class for the Grade II Fillies' Revue (a trial race for the Oka Sho) over 1400 metres at Hanshin and started the 3.4/1 third favourite in sixteen-runner field. Ridden by Yuga Kawada, she won by one and a quarter lengths from Nancy Shine. In the Oka Sho (the first leg of the Triple Crown) on 7 April the filly started the 7.7/1 fifth choice in the betting but finished only tenth behind Ayusan, who won by a neck from Red Oval. On 19 May Meisho Mambo was moved up in distance for the Grade I Yushun Himba over 2400 metres at Tokyo Racecourse and started a 28/1 outsider in an eighteen-runner field. The Flora Stakes winner Denim and Ruby started favourite whilst the other fancied runners included Ayusan, Red Oval, Robe Tissage, Kurofune Surprise (Tulip Sho) and the Flora Stakes runner-up Ever Blossom. After positioning Meisho Mambo in mid- division along the rail, Koshiro Take switched the filly to the right to make a challenge down the centre of the track in the straight. She took the lead 300 metres from the finish and won by one and a quarter lengths from Ever Blossom, with Denim and Ruby two lengths back in third place. Interviewed after the race Take said \\"It has been rarer more than ever that I'm riding in Grade 1 races so I'm especially pleased. All the staff took care of her very well after the Oka Sho. Her owner has given me chances every time and I'm very happy to win such big race with his horse\\". =Autumn= After a break of almost four months Meisho Mambo returned in the Group II Rose Stakes over 1800 metres at Hanshin in September. She finished fourth of the eighteen runners, beaten half a length, a nose and a neck by Denim and Ruby, Chateau Blanche and Uliuli. The third leg of the Triple Crown, the Shuka Sho was run over 1200 metres at Kyoto on 13 October and Meisho Mambo started the 4.2/1 third favourite behind Denim and Ruby and Smart Layer. The other fancied runners included Ever Blossom, Chateau Blanche Uliuli and Robe Tissage. Drawn towards the outside of the eighteen-runner field Meisho Mambo settled in mid division by Koshiro Take as the pace was set by the outsiders Venus Trick and Senkisho. She produced a strong late run on the outside to take the lead 50 metres from the finish and won by one and a quarter lengths from Smart Layer who came out best in a blanket finish for second. Smart Layer was ridden by Take's more famous older brother Yutaka. Koshiro Take commented \\"I was confident because her condition has been better. The stalls position was near the outside so I worried it a little but I decided to use her excellent stride.\\" At Kyoto on 10 November Meisho Mambo was matched against older fillies and mares for the first time in the Queen Elizabeth II Commemorative Cup over 2200 metres and started 2.9/1 second favourite behind the four-year-old Verxina the winner of the 2013 Victoria Mile. The other runners included Denim and Ruby, Whale Capture (2012 Victoria Mile) and All That Jazz (Fuchu Himba). Racing on soft ground on a rainy day she came from well off the pace to take the lead 200 metres from the finish and won by one and a quarter lengths and a neck from Lachesis and Aromatico. After the race Take said \\"This race was much tougher than the previous race, but she's a really strong filly and I‚Äôm looking forward to taking on stronger horses now.\\" In January 2014 at the JRA Awards Meisho Mambo was unanimously voted Japan's champion three-year-old filly of 2013. 2014-2016: Later career When Akihiro Iida retired in February 2014 his stable was taken over by his son Yuji Iida. Meisho Mambo began her third season by taking on male opposition in the Osaka Hai in April and finishing seventh of the eight runners behind Kizuna. On 18 May at Tokyo she produced her best performance of the season as she finished a half length second to Verxina in the Victoria Mile with Straight Girl, Whale Capture, Denim and Ruby, Smart Layer, Robe Tissage, Ever Blossom, Lachesis and Uliuli finishing behind. She made little impact in her four subsequent races that year, finishing unplaced in the Takarazuka Kinen, Kyoto Daishoten, Queen Elizabeth II Cup and Arima Kinen. Meisho Mambo remained in training for two more years but has never recovered her best form. She finished no better than sixth in seven races as a five-year-old and was unplaced in all of her six races in 2016.

Senator Surangel Whipps Jr., who began campaigning for president in 2015 and announced his candidacy earlier in the year, became the first candidate to file his candidacy with the Palau Elections Commission Office om July 20, 2016. Sandra Pierantozzi, the former Vice President under Remengesau, was the only woman to enter the race.

It was held at Li Da's estate at 625 Delhi Chengdu, West of the South Road in the Shanghai International Settlement. It was succeeded by the 3rd National Congress of the Communist Party of China. The congress was attended by 12 people who represented the 195 party members.  Attendance  Recorded in the 6th National Congress held in Moscow during 1928, it listed the 12 participants of the 2nd National Congress as follows: Chen Duxiu, Zhang Guotao, Li Da, Yang Mingzhai, Luo Zhanglong, Wang Jinmei, Xu Baihao, Mao Zedong, Cai Hesen, Tan Pingshan, Li Zhenying, Shi Cuntong. However, this list only denoted the representatives of the congress and is not inclusive of the actual members whom attended the congress. Mao Zedong, for instance, received the notification to attend the congress but did not attend. In the published \\"History of the Chinese Communist Party\\" by the CPC Party Research Center, it stated the ambiguity of Mao's attendance in the congress. Since the official records of the representatives remain ambiguous, leading up to the possibility of \\"someone other than Mao whom attended the congress\\". However, in an interview by American journalist Edgar Snow published under his book Red Star Over China, it was recorded that Mao admitted to Snow of his absence from the 2nd National Congress due to miscommunication.  Significance of the Congress  The congress led to the confirmation and adoption of the Constitution of the Communist Party of China among several other resolutions that were passed during the congress. This included the Declaration of the Second National Congress of the Communist Party of China, Resolution of the CPC on Imperialism and World Events, Resolution On Joining the Communist International, Resolution of the United Front of Democracy, Resolution on the Trade Union Movement and the Communist Party, Resolution on the Communist Youth Movement , Resolution on the Woman's Movement and Resolution on the Constitution of the Communist Party. The declaration made by the 2nd Congress stated the CPC as a \\"branch of the Comintern\\". The congress also saw the approval to join Comintern, a drastic turn from the 1st National Congress where it declared that Comintern was to be made an ally of the CPC. This alignment made at the 2nd Congress would greatly affect the development of the CPC in her early years.

Description and history The Mintzer House stands near the northernmost extent of Burlington's Old North End neighborhood, on the west side of Intervale Avenue roughly midway between Willow and Oak Streets. It is a two-story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof, stone foundation, and an exterior finished in a combination of wooden clapboards and shingles. A recessed porch extends partway along the left side, with an outside sheltered stairway providing access to a rear porch on the same side. The front of the house has a three-part window on the ground floor with stained glass detailing. The interior retains a number of original Colonial Revival details, especially in what is now the second-floor unit. with The area where the Mintzer House stands was rural for many years. Even though a subdivision including its parcel was laid out in 1855, the house was not built until about 1898, and has seen a succession of working-class immigrant residents. The earliest documented resident was William Bessette, a French Canadian, who was a barber. In 1906 it was acquired by the Mintzer family, Russian Jewish immigrants. About 1919 a commercial storefront was added to the front, and part of the building was used as a small shop. This storefront was later removed, when the building was converted to two-family use.

The luxury vehicle is intended to be the first of three in a lineup of mass-market all-electric vehicles designed by Henrik Fisker and produced in the US. Later named the Fisker Ocean, it will have a range of \\"close to 300 miles\\", available on the lowest-cost option. The SUV will be offered in both rear- and all-wheel drive. Power will be supplied by a lithium-ion battery pack with a capacity of around 80 kWh and a solar panel roof as a range extender, adding approximately 1,000 free miles of range per year.Fisker Ocean: Reborn electric-car startup's SUV has a name, cnet, Sean Szymkowski, October 31, 2019 The ultra-high performance version of the Fisker Ocean will be able to go from 0-60 mph in less than 3 seconds, faster than the performance version of the Tesla Model Y. Advanced electronics include the air conditioning unit, which will be housed under the hood. The SUV will be a sustainable vehicle, using recycled plastic from ocean debris, vegan leather, and a solar roof in its top-model spec, and it will recycle waste generated during tire manufacturing for sections of the interior, like the trunk. Even the suede used for the interior is recycled from plastic, bottles, and T-shirts. The look of the SUV is \\"dramatically sculpted\\" with a \\"futuristic, elegant muscular look\\" and \\"captivating design touches that have been traditionally reserved for supercars.\\" By pressing a button, the roof opens in some way to create \\"an extended open-air atmosphere.\\" The vehicle's California Mode will open every window and panel with one button. The fascia includes styling that makes it look like a traditional grille made of a small, center high-mounted radar, behind glass where a parametric pattern dominates the lower front. The inlets in the corners send cool air to the brakes and other areas. There will be a spacious interior with a large display and a dashboard with an intuitive user interface. The Fisker Ocean measures 182.7 inches long, 76 inches wide, and 63.6 inches high, with 20 cubic feet of trunk space (increasing to a maximum of 45 cubic feet with the parcel shelf removed and the rear seats folded). On November 27, 2019, Fisker Inc. announced that the Fisker Ocean would be offered through its flexible lease program for a $379 per month lease payment, with a $2,999 down payment and $250 reservation fee. The Fisker lease program allows customers to return the vehicle at any time, includes maintenance and service, and comes with 30,000 miles per year. The vehicle can also be purchased from the base price of $37,499 (or $29,999 after the US tax credit). There will be five options packages for the vehicle, which will be available for potential customers to view at \\"experience centers\\" opening in 2020 at shopping malls, airports, and other locations. Fisker also announced a partnership with Electrify America to ensure Fisker Ocean vehicles will integrate seamlessly with Electrify America charging stations when the e-SUV hits the market. Following its appearance at the 2020 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, the Fisker Ocean was named to Best of CES 2020 lists by publications including Newsweek (calling it \\"the greenest SUV ever\\"), Time, CNET, Digital Trends, Business Insider, PC Magazine, and Mashable. The prototype was built in Italy by Italdesign. In January 2020, Henrik Fisker stated that the Fisker Ocean would be sold in Germany, Norway, and Sweden in 2022 as its first European markets, ahead of a wider rollout there. More details on the Fisker Ocean will be revealed at the Geneva Motor Show in March 2020. Fisker Alaska On 12 February 2020, Henrik Fisker tweeted, and then deleted, a rear angle render of a pickup truck badged as the Fisker Alaska. The official response from the company did not confirm the name or the product, simply stating that Fisker is working on a modular platform that can be used for multiple electric vehicle models. Ambiguous hints of an electric pickup were previously tweeted by Fisker in August 2019.

Solid- state battery On November 13, 2017, Fisker Inc. announced that it had filed patents on flexible solid-state battery designs, expecting the batteries to be produced on a mass scale around 2023.Joel Stocksdale, \\"Fisker has filed patents for solid-state batteries,\\" Engadget, November 14, 2017. A prototype of the battery, which included 21700 NCM cells from LG Chem, debuted at the Consumer Electronics Show in January 2018. By July 2018 the company's scientists were ahead of schedule and had a revised target year of 2020. On Fisker Inc.'s development team is Dr. Fabio Albano, one of the founders of Sakti3, the solid-state battery startup sold to Dyson in 2015.Nicolas Zart, \\"Fisker Aims To Unleash The Potential Of Solid-State Batteries, & Stun With Emotion,\\" Clean Technica, November 17, 2017. Solid-state batteries have greater energy density and faster charging times than lithium-ion batteries. Fisker states the batteries they are developing will have an energy density 2.5 times that of current batteries, at a smaller size and lower cost than conventional lithium-ion batteries, and will be capable of providing a 750-km (466-mile) driving range with a one-minute charge time.\\"Fisker patents car battery with 500 mile range,\\" Fox Business, November 21, 2017. The batteries will operate in temperatures as cold as -20 Fahrenheit. Fisker Inc. is developing its own technology, with partners building the cells. They are working to define their charging standard that will work with other standards of superchargers. The solid-state batteries will last \\"well over 1,000\\" charge cycles. Fisker says the batteries will take less than 10 days to produce, far less than the 50 to 60 days it takes to produce lithium ion batteries. In October 2018, Fisker Inc. announced new funding through Caterpillar Venture Capital, a subsidiary of the Caterpillar Inc. heavy-machinery manufacturing company, with the money going toward development of Fisker Inc.'s new solid- state battery technology. Caterpillar believes the battery will have applications in construction, energy storage, transportation and mining industries. Fisker Flexee app On November 27, 2019, the company introduced the official Fisker Flexee smartphone app on iOS and Android platforms. The app allows customers to reserve the Fisker Ocean e-SUV, and to schedule test drives beginning in 2021.

Govindarajan under the Venus Combines banner and directed by V. Madhusudhan Rao. It stars Akkineni Nageswara Rao, Vanisri, Kanchana in the lead roles and music composed by K. V. Mahadevan. The film is a remake of the Kannada movie Baalu Belagithu (1970), which was also remade in Hindi as Humshakal (1974) and in Tamil as Oorukku Uzhaippavan (1976). Plot Chandra (Vanisri) is a poor girl who lives with her ailing mother. Once when she is out to buy medicine for her mother, a goon tries to outrage her modesty and follows her till her house. Satyam (Akkineni Nageswara Rao) is also a poor youth. Incidentally, he comes across Chandra and saves her from the clutches of the goon. On the request of the dying old lady, Satyam promises to take care of her daughter. In order to keep his promise, Satyam takes care of Chandra. However, soon society starts questioning their relationship. In a fit of rage, Satyam marries Chandra in a temple. The newly-wedded woman knows nothing about her husband and thus asks him about his work and designation. He tells her that he works in Ratan Mahal in different positions according to the demand of the situation. But unfortunately, he is the owner of Ratan Mahal, with a six-year- old daughter Rani (Baby Sumathi) and his wife Lalitha (Kanchana) is a mental patient who is under treatment in a psychiatric center. Raju (Satyanarayana) is a gang leader who forces young girls to blackmail rich men and one Anand is in search of him with help of his friend Chakram (Raja Babu). After some time, Chandra gives birth to a baby boy and Lalitha recovers from her mental illness. However, the doctor warns them that any kind of shock would affect her health again. After returning home, Lalitha insists on visiting a temple. Inside the temple premises, Rani gets lost and coincidentally, Chandra takes her back to her mother. For this act of kindness, Lalitha develops the friendship with Chandra and invites her to Ratan Mahal. Both the ladies also talk about their respective husbands. Things take a shocking turn when Chandra's baby is ill and reaches Ratan Mahal to find her husband Satyam playing Anand, the husband of Lalitha and the boss of the Ratan Mahal. She accuses him of cheating both women. After recalling the doctor's warning to not give any shock to Lalitha, he denies playing a double role. He tells Chandra that he is Anand and does not know anything about her. Later, Chandra leaves a letter for her husband informing him about their son's death and goes missing. On the other hand, Anand needs to visit Bangalore for accomplishing his secret mission of finding the murderer. Lalitha insists on going with him. He could not deny the request and thus takes his wife and daughter to Bangalore. They check into a hotel where Anand receives a call from his assistant regarding their secret mission. Lalitha hears their conversation and she again falls ill. Anand calls for a doctor. He is shocked to see Chandra as the nurse, who is known as Sita. Finally, Anand is about to succeed in his mission when Raju informs him that his wife and daughter are kidnapped. Anand and Chakram come to the kidnapper and finally, Raju is arrested. Now, the case is in the court where Anand (another Akkineni Nageswara Rao) is standing in the witness box and narrates a story. Once Anand and Lalitha visit their estate where they met with an accident, a look-alike of him, Satyam saved the baby. Then Anand came to know that he was Satyam and works as a laborer in their estate. Meanwhile, Anand sees that Lalitha was lying unconscious on the road. Anand asks Satyam to take care of the baby and sets out to take Lalitha to a doctor. On the way, his ex-girlfriend Mala stops his car and demands a heavy ransom. She calls him to a hotel to receive the money. In the hotel, she tells Anand about Raju, who had actually forced her to blackmail him. At the same time, Raju arrived, shot her dead and the blame comes to Anand. Now, Anand asks Satyam to act as Anand and to stay at the Ratan Mahal. Satyam promised that he would never let anyone know about the name exchange. After listening to Anand, the judge frees him and gives death sentence to the criminal Raju. At the end, Anand and Satyam decide to stay together like two brothers.

The gold coin from India was found in tomb IV (the male warrior).

The coin was found in Afghanistan's Jowzjan Province, possibly the site of an early Indo-Iranian settlement. It was used as a necropolis for a wealthy family during the early Kushan period. Since the time of the Buddha, Buddhist representations had been aniconic. This raises the possibility that this coin is one of the earliest, if not the earliest, representation of the Buddha.Image Problems: The Origin and Development of the Buddha's Image in Early South Asia, Robert Daniel DeCaroli, University of Washington Press, 2015, p.20-26 G√©rard Fussman et Anna Maria Quagliotti, The early iconography of Avalokitesvara L'iconographie ancienne d'Avalokitesvara, Coll√®ge de France, Publications de l'Institut de Civilisation indienne.

The much smaller size of LoAD belies its shorter operational range and need to fit within an MX shipping container. Sentry, known for most of its lifetime as LoADS for Low Altitude Defense System, was a short-range anti-ballistic missile (ABM) design made by the US Army during the 1970s. It was proposed as a defensive weapon that would be used in concert with the MX missile, a US Air Force ICBM that was under development. The LoADS concept was one of a number of proposals that were made as part of a larger and acrimonious debate over the best way to base the MX missile. It was believed that by about 1980 Soviet ICBMs would improve to the point where it was possible to attack US ICBMs while they were still in their silos. A number of warfighting scenarios suggested that a surprise attack would significantly reduce the US stockpile and greatly blunt any counterattack. In the case of the MX, a single successful strike on a silo would mean ten warheads would not reach the USSR, making these extremely valuable targets. To ensure such an attack would fail, at least to the point where the Mutual Assured Destruction (MAD) would be maintained, a wide variety of basing options were considered that would guarantee the survival of at least dozens of MX's. One way to improve the survival of the ICBM force would be to actively defend it with an ABM system. However, the 1972 ABM treaty greatly limited the number and geographical deployment of any ABM, with the aim of preventing whole-country protection and thus ensuring MAD. LoADS addressed these limitations by being deployed along with the radars and engagement computers needed to make a successful attack at only very short ranges, or less. The entire system was packed into a cylinder that looked like an MX and would be shuffled between the silos. As the LoADS could be in any of the silos at a particular missile site, the enemy would have to expend two warheads on every silo to ensure a hit, as one would be assumed lost to LoADS. This would not stop a successful counterforce attack, but it would make it significantly more expensive in terms of the number of warheads used, potentially requiring more warheads than the Soviets had. With President Jimmy Carter's decision to base the MX in a series of less-hardened horizontal silos in 1977, LoADS development was accelerated. The system as a whole was renamed Sentry, with the missile becoming the Baseline Terminal Defense System, or BTDS. Work on MX and Sentry was further accelerated by incoming President Ronald Reagan in 1981. However, after another review of the MX program, Reagan chose a different MX deployment concept and cancelled Sentry, stating that it would violate the ABM treaty. As the questionable security of the MX once again became an issue, Reagan briefly entertained an even shorter-range system known as Swarmjet, before the entire MX program was severely curtailed with the ending of the Cold War.  Background = ICBM vulnerability  Early ICBMs had accuracy on the order of , which made them useful against only the largest targets. Through the 1960s this was progressively improved, and the US estimated that the Soviets would have \\"substantial\\" capability of directly attacking US missile silos by the 1980 time frame. This led to a worrying scenario coming to dominate US strategic thinking through the 1970s and 80s. If the Soviets launched a sneak attack on the US using only a portion of their missile fleet, about , aimed solely at US silos and airbases, they could hope to destroy as much as 90% of the US's fleet. This attack would not kill many civilians, and leave the US with only a few ICBMs and bombers, along with the US Navy's Submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) fleet. However, the SLBMs of that era were not accurate enough to attack missile silos, the US would not be able to respond with a counterforce attack against the substantial numbers of remaining Soviet ICBMs. The only option left would be a general attack on Soviet cities, which would cause the Soviets to respond in kind with their remaining fleet. In this situation, the Soviets would be in an extremely advantageous position for a negotiated peace. When faced with such an attack, it might not be immediately clear what the targets are. The only way to be sure would be to wait until well into the attack and then respond in kind. This took long enough that some portion of the US fleet would be caught on the ground, and this \\"retaliation after ride-out\\" concept was considered too risky. Instead, the US policy moved to launch on warning, where they would respond to an attack as soon as it was clear one was in the making. This was not ideal, as it required them to maintain a high alert level that increased the risk of an accidental launch.  Missile, Experimental  In 1964 the Air Force issued a contract to TRW to consider the problem of ICBM survivability under the name \\"Golden Arrow\\", looking for ways to make their own missiles as invulnerable as the Navy's. Ideally, the US ICBM fleet should be able to ride out an attack and then launch a response, which would require as many as 1,000 warheads, one for each Soviet ICBM silo. Not only did they have to survive, but they had to have the ability to be quickly retargeted so the surviving US missiles could be aimed only at the remaining Soviet missiles, not empty silos. One early conclusion was that it was possible to build missile silos that would survive any conceivable warhead exploding at a distance of . It was assumed that Soviet warheads during the late 1970s would have accuracy better than one mile, so the question became how to ensure the warheads would not approach within that distance. Among the many solutions studied, one quickly rose to the top, the idea of valley basing. This would rely on the physical barrier presented by surrounding hills or mountains to keep warheads away from the silos in the valleys between them. Warheads approach on a shallow trajectory, so mountains or mesas with steep sides would mean the warhead would impact the terrain before reaching the silo. TRW suggested building three bases with thirty missiles each, and estimated that one of the three bases would survive an all-out counterforce attack. To ensure that 600 warheads would survive, each missile would have to carry about 20 warheads. These studies led to the Missile, Experimental, or MX, project, which started in 1971. The design rapidly firmed up, emerging with ten- warheads on more missiles in order to raise the survivors to 1,000 warheads. But the basing became not so much a specific concept as a catch-all program for every possible concept, from railway deployments, to underground racetracks, to mobile systems. A review of the options written in the mid-1970s ran into hundreds of pages.  Hardpoint and Hardsite  Through the 1950s and 60s, the US Army had been developing ABM systems as a defense against the ICBM. At first these were tasked with countering a force of dozens or maybe 100 warheads, targeted against US cities and large industrial sites. This was seen as a relatively simple task not unlike the Army's existing anti- aircraft role. However, as the numbers of ICBMs in the Soviet forces rapidly grew, the price of implementing such a system quickly ran out of control, reaching $40 billion ($ billion in ), a significant amount of the total budget of the US Department of Defense. ARPA was asked to consider the problem of using the technology in a cost-effective way, and noticed one possible application. As Soviet warheads were accurate to within only a few kilometers, and they had to fall within less than a kilometer to kill a missile silo, that meant the Soviets would have to launch several warheads at every US silo in a counterforce attack. The defender had a significant advantage here; they could watch the incoming warheads, see if any were going to come within the lethal range of a silo, and then shoot just those ones. This meant a small number of ABMs would be effective against a huge number of Soviet warheads. ARPA began researching such a system under the name Hardpoint. To ensure they shot only at valid targets, it had to generate very accurate tracks for the enemy warheads. They also had only seconds to develop that track and launch a missile, assuming that that air would be filled with nuclear explosions that would render higher altitudes opaque to radar, an effect known as nuclear blackout. They began development of a new radar known as the Hardpoint Demonstration Array Radar, or HAPDAR, and a new extremely high-speed missile known as HIBEX. The entire engagement would last just over two seconds, with the intercept taking place at about altitude. They later added a second stage to HIBEX known as UPSTAGE, demonstrating over 300 g of lateral acceleration, allowing it to counter maneuvering warheads. ARPA released its Hardpoint study in 1965. It presented a way for the Army to offer an effective ABM system at a reasonable cost. At the same time, it would ensure that the Air Force's missiles would survive any sort of small-scale attack envisioned by the military planners. This led to a series of Army-Air Force studies under the name Hardsite. Hardsite initially considered the idea of using the existing Nike-X hardware being proposed around large cities to deliberately offer additional protection to Air Force and other military bases in the area. A second series of studies considered cut-down deployments to protect remote bases, like the missile fields. This later concept quickly captured the majority of follow-up work.  ABM treaty  Robert McNamara felt that deploying an ABM system would simply prompt the Soviets to built more ICBMs to overwhelm it, leading to a new arms race. He also felt that more missiles meant more chances for an accidental launch, which would actually increase the change of a war and lower overall security. McNamara constantly delaying deployment of Nike-X, but faced increasing criticism for doing so. When the Chinese tested their first H-bomb in 1967, McNamara announced a much smaller deployment known as Sentinel as a \\"Chinese oriented\\" system. The President also offered to hold off construction on Sentinel if the Soviets did the same. As the Soviets continued construction of their ABM at Moscow, the President ordered the construction of the first Sentinel site outside Boston. This was met by a firestorm of protest on the part of local citizens who were not happy about a nuclear missile base being built literally in their back yard. The incoming President Nixon was forced to realign the system to something more similar to Hardsite, using the Nike-X systems for the defense of the Minuteman fields in a new system known as Safeguard. This placed the launch sites in distant locations that were less controversial. In the midst of construction of the first two Safeguard sites, the Soviets returned to the negotiations. This led to the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, limiting each side to a total of 100 interceptor missiles located in up to two ABM bases, and amending that to only one base in 1974. The Soviets chose to complete their system around Moscow while the US continued with construction of one of the Safeguard sites outside Grand Forks, North Dakota. The argument for and against the Safeguard system continued both in the military and public arenas, and the system was ultimately shut down in 1975 after only one day of official operation.  LoADS = Continuing work  As a hedge against the possibility of the Soviets \\"breaking out\\" of the ABM treaty, the Army was given the go-ahead to continue development of ABM technologies, focusing on the Safeguard-like concept of defending the missile fields. The Army responded with two concepts, updates to the original Safeguard using a new radar and upgraded Sprint II missile, and a new concept for a high-altitude interceptor that would use hit-to-kill instead of a nuclear warhead. Work on the former, known as Site Defence of Minuteman, went as far as building a radar at the Army's testing site on Meck Island in the Kwajalein Atoll, but work on this program ended in 1974 when it was clear the treaty was going to be followed by both countries. Work on MX also continued, and by the mid-1970s the preferred MX basing mode was the Multiple Protective Shelter (MPS) concept. In this system each MX missile would be installed in a network of hardened shelters, 23 in most plans, and moved between them at random. The transports would be camouflaged and duplicated so the Soviets would not know where the missiles were. A counterforce attack would thus require the Soviets to expend 23 warheads for every MX missile to ensure destruction. With a total of 4,500 shelters and 200 missiles moving between them, the system could soak up a significant portion of the Soviet's 5,928 ICBM warheads and survive. In this basing mode, a system like Safeguard was of little use. If the Soviets needed to fire 4,500 warheads to ensure the destruction of the MX force, expending another 100 to soak up an ABM system was of little consequence. Through the 1970s a number of alternative concepts to defend the silos had been proposed. Richard Garwin outlined a series of alternatives to large-scale ABM systems like Safeguard. Among these ideas were a \\"bed of nails\\" consisting of vertical steel spikes surrounding the silo that would destroy the warhead before it hit the ground and triggered, jamming systems to interrupt radar fuses, the dust defense where small nuclear warheads would be set off while the warheads approached and throw huge amounts of dust into the air that would abrade the warheads, and a non-nuclear version of the same concept, the \\"curtain of steel pellets\\". The last of these was picked up by Bernard Feld and Kosta Tsipis in a major article in Scientific American in 1979. They proposed replacing the shotgun-like projectiles with swarms of small unguided rockets that would fire at a range of about . As they were unguided, they suggested that they would not be considered interceptor missiles under the ABM treaty, but also suggested that a renegotiation might be required. The Army picked up these options, developing two concepts. The first, Project Quick-Shot, was basically identical to the Feld and Tsipis version, although they did consider some sort of low-cost guidance system as well. A second concept launched optical trackers into space in the path of the incoming missiles, and used their data to fine-tune the launch of unguided rockets that would work at longer ranges. As this had no radar component, it would bypass provisions in the ABM treaty over the number and placement of radar sites. However, they also considered a more conventional concept using what was essentially a version of HIBEX and UPSTAGE, and in 1976 they placed a contract with McDonnell Douglas to study a low-altitude concept under the name ST-2, using a nuclear-tipped missile. This proved the most interesting, and led to the LoADS program in 1977.  LoADS concept  LoADS proposed placing one interceptor in one of the decoy shelters, thus every set of 23 shelters would have one MX, one LoADS and 21 decoys. At first glance it might appear that only one additional enemy warhead would be needed, using up the LoADS interceptor. However, only the defender knew where the MX was, and LoADS would only fire at the single warhead seen approaching that shelter. That meant that the MX would almost definitely survive a single warhead attack. In order to be sure the MX was hit, the Soviets would have to attack every shelter with two warheads, assuming one would be lost to the LoADS. For a typical 23-site MPS, 46 warheads would be needed, so if LoADS remained within the 100-interceptor limit of the ABM treaty, 4,600 warheads would be needed to attack just one-half of the 200-strong MX fleet, leaving 100 missiles and 1,000 warheads in the US counterattack. An attack against the entire fleet would require them to break the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks limits on the number of offensive warheads. This proposal, for the first time, made a solid argument for ABM deployment as a counterforce weapon. Previously each ABM required a corresponding warhead to offset it, but with LoADS and MPS, a single ABM required multiple warheads to offset it. The same end could be achieved by simply building more shelters as well, but the size of the proposed MPS network already took up large portions of Nevada and Utah, and adding more would not be easy. Even a high unit price, LoADS would still be less expensive than building double the number of shelters. Additionally, as each set of MPS shelters, or cells, would have only a single LoADS, the problems with nuclear blackout causing problems for follow-up shots was not an issue, a problem that had never been solved in Safeguard-like solutions. However, there was a concern in regards to the ABM treaty, involving its use of radars. In order to ensure ABM systems would be suitable for point defense only, the ABM treaty limited the number and placement of radar systems. LoADS had a radar with each missile, but these were very short-range and could not be considered part of a wide-area system, although observers suggested the Soviets would claim otherwise. More importantly, the 1974 amendment to the treaty required those radars to be in the vicinity of Grand Forks, which would not help MPS, which was located well over to the southwest. The Army thus developed LoADS strictly as a technology demonstration program, with the option of rapid construction in case the ABM treaty ended. Costs of a deployed system was estimated to be $8.63 billion in 1980 ( billion in ).  Sentry  Seeking to lower the spiralling cost of the MX system, which had reached at least $35 billion by the end of the 1970s, Jimmy Carter announced a greatly simplified deployment using simpler silos and reduced number of false launchers. The launchers changed from vertical to horizontal, which would reduce the cost of building them and make it simpler to rapidly move the missiles in and out of the silos without it being easily seen. LoADS was adapted to work in these new shelters, and by the late 1970s was known as the Baseline Terminal Defense System. But Carter's choice had only just been made when Ronald Reagan won the presidency and set about re-examining the MX plans. In October 1981 they announced MX deployment would be sped up, cancelling the MPS basing and recommending the missiles temporarily be placed in existing Titan II and Minuteman silos until a final solution could be decided on. Work on LoADS continued, in and June 1982 was renamed Sentry. The program was told to be prepared to go into production on short notice. Work on the high-altitude non-nuclear concept was also ongoing through this period, and would ultimately be demonstrated in 1984's Homing Overlay Experiment.  Cancellation  On 22 November 1982, Reagan held another conference on the MX issue. He announced that MPS was being abandoned and replaced by the Dense Pack concept. This would consist of new super-hardened silos that could withstand very close hits, packed together in groups of 100. The theory was that a warhead attacking any one of the silos would destroy others near it when it exploded, a concept known as nuclear fratricide. One of the arguments in favor of Dense Pack was that it \\"lends itself to ABM defense a little better\\". Nevertheless, Reagan went on to state that \\"we do not wish to embark on any course of action that could endanger the current ABM treaty so long as it is observed by the Soviet Union... we do not wish to build even the minimal ABM system allowed us by the treaty.\\" In February 1983, Sentry was officially cancelled. Work on the radar system continued and was later renamed the Terminal Imaging Radar, with an expanded mission to provide accurate tracks over a wide area. Technologies from this program ultimately led to the X-band radar. Work on the warhead design also continued, but was later moved to a \\"third generation\\" design, and in 1983 the Department of Energy noted there were nine such designs under consideration.  Description  The LoADS \\"Defense Unit\\" was designed to be the same size, shape and weight as an MX missile shipping container. The baseline LoADS design was a single-stage missile consisting of three stacked conical sections; a pointed conical nose-cone, a slightly flared cylinder through the midsection forming the majority of the missile body, and a flared rear section surrounding the rocket nozzles. It was very similar to the upper stage of the Sprint missile, although lacking the Sprint's small aerodynamic fins. Each missile would be packaged into a container known as the \\"Defense Unit\\" that would look identical to the MX container. The LoADS was much smaller than MX, which allowed the container to hold the missile, communications, radar and ejector systems needed to launch the missile. Given warning of an attack, the LoADS would be pushed through the roof of the shelter (or raised in the case of a vertical silo) to reveal its radar and begin searching for incoming warheads. When one was determined to be approaching the location of the MX, LoADS would fire, attacking the warhead at very low altitude, about . LoADS used a nuclear warhead to attack its targets, and its close proximity to the ground when it fired meant it was only able to be used over hardened targets like a missile silo. The Army also worked on hit-to-kill warheads for a mid- range system, but at the time of its cancellation they had not been able to demonstrate the feasibility of this approach.

PERMANOVA is used to compare groups of objects and test the null hypothesis that the centroids and dispersion of the groups as defined by measure space are equivalent for all groups. A rejection of the null hypothesis means that either the centroid and/or the spread of the objects is different between the groups. Hence the test is based on the prior calculation of the distance between any two objects included to the experiment. PERMANOVA shares some resemblance to ANOVA where they both measure the sum-of-squares within and between group and make use of F test to compare within-group to between-group variance. However, while ANOVA bases the significance of the result on assumption of normality, PERMANOVA draws tests for significance by comparing the actual F test result to that gained from random permutations of the objects between the groups. Moreover, whilst PERMANOVA tests for similarity based on a chosen distance measure, ANOVA tests for similarity of the group averages. Calculation of the statistic In the simple case of a single factor with p groups and n objects in each group,the total sum-of-squares is determined as: : SS_T=\\\\frac 1 N \\\\sum_{i=1}^{N-1} \\\\sum_{j=i+1}^N d^2_{ij} where N is the total number of objects, and d^2_{ij} is the squared distance between objects i and j. Similarly, the within groups sum-of-squares is determined: : SS_W=\\\\frac 1 n \\\\sum_{i=1}^{N-1} \\\\sum_{j=i+1}^N d^2_{ij}\\\\epsilon_{ij} where \\\\epsilon_{ij} takes the value of 1 if observation i and observation j are in the same group, otherwise it takes the value of zero. Then, the between groups sum-of-squares (SS_A) can be calculated as the difference between the overall and the within groups sum-of-squares: : SS_A=SS_T-SS_W Finally, a pseudo F-statistic is calculated: : F=\\\\frac{\\\\left(\\\\dfrac{SS_A}{p-1}\\\\right)}{\\\\left( \\\\dfrac{SS_W}{N-p}\\\\right)} where p is the number of groups. Drawing significance Finally, the PERMANOVA procedure draws significance for the actual F statistic by performing multiple permutations of the data. In each such the items are shuffled between groups. For each such permutation of the data the permutation F statistic is calculated. The p-value is then calculated by: : P = \\\\frac{(\\\\text{count } F^p \\\\geq F)+1}{(\\\\text{total count } F^p)+1} Where F is the F statistic obtained from the original data and F^p is a permutation F statistic. Implementation and use PERMANOVA is widely used in the field of ecology and is implemented in several software packages including PERMANOVA software, PRIMER and R (programming language) Vegan and lmPerm packages.

Ren√© Theler was voted as club chairman at the AGM. This was Theler's second period as chairman. Overview Helmut Benthaus was first team manager for the thirteeth consecutive season. During the off-season there were only two changes in the squad. Goalkeeper Hans K√ºng joined from Xamax and Hansruedi Sch√§r joined from lower tier FC Oensingen. All other mutations were internal between the first team and the reserves. Basel played a total of 54 games in their 1977‚Äì78 season. 32 in the domestic league, four in the Swiss Cup, four in the Swiss League Cup, two in the European Cup, four in the Cup of the Alps and eight were friendly matches. The team scored a total of 125 goals and conceded 88. Roland Sch√∂nenberger was the team's overall top goal scorer with 26 goals, Detlev Lauscher and Erni Maissen each netted 15 times. Basel played in the 1977‚Äì78 Nationalliga A. This was contested by the first 10 teams from the previous season and the two newly promoted teams Etoile Carouge and Young Fellows Z√ºrich. The champions would qualify for the 1978‚Äì79 European Cup and the Swiss Cup winners would qualify for 1978‚Äì79 Cup Winners' Cup. The UEFA modified the entry rules for Switzerland again and, therefore, this season only two teams would qualify for the 1977‚Äì78 UEFA Cup. Due to the fact that Basel were reigning champions and because there were only minor mutations in the squad, the club's primary aim was to defend their championship title. The Nationalliga A was played in two stages. The qualification phase was played by all 12 teams in a double round robin, and after completion of this stage, the teams were divided into two groups. The first six teams contended in the championship group (with half the obtained points in the first stage as bonus) and the positions seventh to twelfth contended the relegation group (also with half the obtained points as bonus). Basel ended the qualification round in fourth position and ended the championship group in third position with 27 points, two points behind Grasshopper Club and one behind Servette. They failed their championship aim, being beaten 2‚Äì4 by the Grasshoppers in the very last game of the season. Basel scored a total of 74 goals conceding 48 in their 32 domestic leaguw games. Roland Sch√∂nenberger was the team's top goal scorer with 16 league goals. Detlev Lauscher, Erni Maissen and J√∂rg Stohler each scored 9 goals. In the first round of the Swiss Cup Basel were drawn against FC Lerchenfeld Thun and this was the first time that these two clubs had ever played against each other. Basel won this away game 4‚Äì2. In the next round they beat Z√ºrich away 3‚Äì1 and St. Gallen at home 4‚Äì1 in the quarter-final. Therefore Basel advanced to the semi-finals before being knocked out of the competition by Grasshopper Club. Servette won the competition this season. In the first round of the Swiss League Cup Basel were drawn against Wettingen. Also in this competition Basel advanced to the semi-finals before being knocked out. St. Gallen won the competition beating Grasshopper Club 3‚Äì2 in the final. As reigning Swiss champions Basel were qualified for the 1977‚Äì78 European Cup and in the first round they were drawn against Austrian champions FC Wacker Innsbruck. After a home defeat and an away win, this competition was concluded after the first round, Wacker won 3‚Äì2 on aggregate. In the Coppa delle Alpi Basel played in group B together with Bastia, Olympique Lyonnais and Lausanne-Sport.

Those conversations eventually became the inspiration for Akkara Kazhchakal, a Malayalam-language sitcom that landed a 30-minute slot on an Indian television station for several seasons. \\"That really took off after we put it on air and YouTube and it kick-started our career because it went viral and everyone was talking about it,\\" Varghese said. After receiving positive feedback for the series (and millions of hits on YouTube), Varghese and his colleagues shifted their attention into launching a new comedy series that would appeal to a broader audience. \\"The show is about the daily quirkiness that we have,‚Äù Varghese told India-West. ‚ÄúYou know, issues like marriage, five-year anniversary, little things like slices of life. We have tried to incorporate a lot of that which will be relatable to the major audiences.‚Äù While speaking to NBC Varghese said \\"During the writing process, the team didn't set out to make anything revolutionary, or to make any big statements. The series was more of an opportunity to put 22 minutes of entertaining and relatable comedy out there for the world to watch. The team was also careful not to exaggerate or portray the characters in the series in an unrealistic manner.\\" Speaking to The News Minute Bare one of the producers said, \\"It is basically a sitcom taking a satirical look at the life of Indians and other brown-skinned communities in the backdrop of NYC. It's not a very serious or preachy depiction of the issues. The comedy really comes from the everyday activities of the characters who are into the rat race typical of city life. The cultural differences of the Indian, Middle Eastern, Chinese, Caucasian, and African-American characters also helps.\\" He added \\"It was widely felt that Outsourced had a local perspective of the things which didn't help in capturing the Indian situation that truthfully. We have a more balanced scripting department with talents from American as well as Indian backgrounds. That we believe has resulted in a programme which will be palatable to both the audiences.\\"http://www.thenewsminute.com/article/indian- it-adventure-new-york-brown-nation-abi-varghese-coming-soon-netflix-52830 Filming Principal photography took place in Queens, Brooklyn, Manhattan, and New Brunswick over a 30-day period mid-2014. Production was supervised by producer Atit Shah and his company Create Entertainment. Casting Varghese cast the lead roles well before the filming of season one as he had created a trailer to pitch the show in 2012 with many of the same actors. Binning who plays Gautam said \\"I am incredibly proud of being a lead character in this series. The show truly showcases different parts of my Asian culture and has educated me about aspects I didn't know about before, always resulting in hilarity\\". \\"When we got into casting aspect we tried to get as many diverse and different type of actors to play it so that we mix up the comic timing,\\" Varghese said. Reception Mashable said \\"At 10 half-hour episodes, Brown Nation is an easy binge, and an enjoyable one at that. There's no singular pop culture analogy for what it feels like, but the characters are authentic in their heritage and as goofy as any sitcom could want.\\". The article added \\"What‚Äôs extra smart about Brown Nation is that it isn‚Äôt Culture 101. There are snatches of regional Indian languages. There's talk of arranged marriage and tense family relations, but handled with a key ingredient: nuance.\\" Broadcast and distribution Brown Nation was initially reported to be released by the Indian TV network Star Plus but eventually ended up being picked up for a global release for all 190 countries serving Netflix. The episodes are approximately twenty-two to twenty-five minutes, and are broadcast in both high-definition and 4K. Netflix picking up the series is a hopeful sign for independent filmmakers and another step into offering a variety of diverse content to audiences, according to Varghese. \\"This is still an independent production and that's what I'm most proud of‚Ä¶ this really opens the doors for a lot of independent filmmakers,\\" he said. \\"I think the fact that Netflix and other platforms are open to such content is a big sign that we are headed in the right direction and in terms of diversity, and also as an independent filmmaker, I think it's good on both sides.\\" Varghese noted that series like The Mindy Project and Master of None have tremendously paved the way for South Asian representation, but while there is progress, there are more stories to tell. \\"Our show is a little bit quirkier, I don't think it's as drama driven as the other two shows, but I think there's a lot more stories that we're able to explore.\\" Varghese is hoping for a second season of Brown Nation, but for now, he's focusing his efforts on another series called Metropark. He hopes to hold off on Brown Nation and take a closer look at the type of feedback the series elicits to see if there's enough substance for another season. \\"I just want to make sure that people, when they hear 'Brown Nation,' to get a smile out of it‚Ä¶.just trying to make 22 minutes that would put a smile on people's faces after a rough day or something you can watch with your family that doesn't have any sexual innuendos or fights. Just plain, simple, comedy,\\" Varghese said.

Tremlett began as a captain in the 20th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry Regiment from 1861 to 1862, then as a major in 1862, and eventually a lieutenant-colonel in 1864 commanding the 39th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry Regiment.  Early life  Tremlett was born in Dorchester, Massachusetts in 1833, the son of Thomas Tremlett, a successful shipping merchant doing business as Deblois & Tremlett on the waterfront at 28 Foster's Wharf in Boston, and Cordelia Dixon. In 1846 he was still living in Dorchester but was also listed as a student at the prestigious college-preparatory Chauncey Hall School in Boston. Three years later, Tremlett's residence was listed as the same. By then one may assume he was at least an upperclassman if not a senior. Tremlett loved to travel, and after graduation from Chauncey Hall, he indulged that passion, including trips to exotic places like Chagres, Panama in 1850 and Calcutta, India in 1851. Especially for affluent young students, it was customary in the nineteenth century for them to travel after graduation, often quite extensively, to augment their education with the experience gained from touring the world. From 1851 to 1854, Tremlett's whereabouts become a little difficult to track. It may be assumed that after graduating from Chauncey Hall, he may have applied to university, and if so, his first choice would likely have been Harvard. However, there is no record in the index of graduates in Harvard's Quinquennial Catalog of Officers and Graduates, 1636‚Äì1930 of anyone with a surname of Tremlett as having ever graduated there. Perhaps he attended Harvard but didn't graduate or otherwise furthered his formal education elsewhere. Perhaps for unknown reasons, Tremlett found university not to his liking, as there is no evidence that he was awarded a degree anywhere else either. Perhaps he decided to postpone university, putting it off in favor of his love of travel. Tremlett was apparently more interested in pursuing a mercantile life, for in 1855, at age twenty-two, he settled down long enough to indeed enter into business in Boston with his older brother Frank (Francis E.) as Tremlett Bros. & Company, which at first was separate from their father's firm. In the U.S. Census of 1855, Henry is listed as being employed at Tremlett Bros. & Company as a clerk. It would appear that between 1855 and 1857, with their father's health declining, Tremlett Bros. merged with Deblois & Tremlett, and at some point ownership officially transitioned to Frank and Henry. The Boston Atlas newspaper announced a partnership on March 2, 1857, between the brothers and a third party, one Fred H. Odiorne. On September 8, 1858, Tremlett's father, Thomas, now in very poor health, returned on a voyage from England accompanied by his wife Cordelia, and their daughter Cordelia Rayner aboard the Charmer. The Charmer was captained by Isaac Shaw Lucas, who was married to Tremlett's sister Mary. Thomas Tremlett died less than a week later on September 13, 1858, at the age of sixty-one. In 1859, Tremlett Bros. & Company was a successful going concern, with offices at 222 State Street and a bustling harbor location at 146 Broad Street on Foster's Wharf. Tremlett was back living with his family at 245 Shawmut Avenue, clearly in the prime of his life with a bright future, but a monstrous squall was forming on the horizon. A photo of Tremlett taken in Boston by Silsbee, Case & Company portrays a man not large, but fit and trim at the waist, with dark eyes and hair and a thick handlebar moustache connecting to his sideburns. Seated in his captain's uniform, he conveys an air of dignity if not swagger, and an exposed watch chain runs to his watch, tucked into a slit pocket on the left breast.  Civil War  The attack on Fort Sumter occurred on April 12, 1861. First Sergeant Henry Martin Tremlett, 4th Battalion, Massachusetts Militia, 1861 On April 25, Henry joined the Massachusetts Militia, fourth battalion, at Fort Warren located on Georges Island at the entrance to Boston Harbor. There he rose to the rank of sergeant in a short time. On June 28, 1861, Massachusetts governor John A. Andrew appointed Colonel William Raymond Lee to command the Twentieth Regiment of Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry Regiment. Lee, a civil engineer in private life, was a classmate of Jefferson Davis at West Point and a veteran of the Florida Indian wars against the Seminoles. There is apparently no genealogical link between Colonel Lee and arguably the finest general of the war, Robert E. Lee.  The Twentieth Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry Regiment  On July 10, 1861, less than three months after his time began at Fort Warren, Tremlett enlisted in the Twentieth Massachusetts Regiment which was forming up at Readville, south of Boston. The camp at Readville was named Camp Massasoit after the great Wampanoag Grand Sachem, but the regiment was often referred to as \\"The Harvard Regiment\\" because many of its officers were educated at Harvard University. The Twentieth Massachusetts was organized into ten companies. Tremlett was commissioned to the rank of captain and assigned to command Company A. The regiment was initially part of Lander's Brigade, Second Division, Second Corps. On September 4, 1861, two months after First Manassas, the Twentieth Massachusetts received orders to leave for the front. They left Boston without any fanfare; they simply and quietly boarded trains for Washington. As one member of the regiment recalled, \\"We did not go into Boston and have a parade on the common as so many of the regiments did on their way to the field. In fact the twentieth never appeared in Boston as a regiment, neither when it first left for the war, nor at the close of the war.\\"Bruce, Brevet Lt. Colonel George A., The Twentieth Regiment of Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry 1861‚Äì1865, Cambridge, MA: Houghton, Mifflin, Riverside Press, 1906, p.10. https://archive.org/details/20thregimentmass00brucrich, accessed December 3, 2015. After stops in New York, Philadelphia, and Baltimore they reached their final destination, Washington, on September 7. On September 12, the regiment was given orders to march to Poolesville, Maryland. Poolesville was located on the east bank of the Potomac River, thirty-five miles north of Washington. Virginia and the Confederacy were located on the west bank. At Poolesville, the Twentieth was joined by at least two other Massachusetts infantry regiments, the Fifteenth and the Nineteenth, as well as Vaughn's Rhode Island Artillery Battery and others in the order of battle, all under the command of Brigadier General Charles Pomeroy Stone and ultimately General of the Army of the Potomac George McClellan. The army would remain at Poolesville a full month, assigned to picket duty along the Potomac River, consumed by daily drills, shooting practice, and strict discipline, including no noise after taps. = Ball's Bluff = The first engagement in which Henry and the Twentieth Massachusetts tasted combat was the Union debacle known as the Battle of Ball's Bluff outside Leesburg, Virginia. Misinformation and poor generalship resulted in a horrible defeat. Ball's Bluff was not a large battle but it was another early Confederate victory and another ugly Union defeat at a time when Washington was growing more and more impatient over the lack of military success. Comparative battle strength between South and North was even . . . about 1,700 Union troops clashed with the same number of Confederate soldiers, but the Confederates earned a decisive victory. Union casualties numbered over 1,000, including 223 killed, 226 wounded, and an astounding number, 550, were captured or missing.\\"The Civil War Trust, http://www.civilwar.org/, accessed October 24, 2015. Despite the loss, late in the battle Tremlett was able to distinguish himself by organizing an escape with approximately 100 men by moving upriver under cover of darkness, acquiring a small boat, and transferring the men to the safety of the eastern bank of the Potomac river. Regimental surgeon Dr. Nathan Hayward recorded, \\"All our officers of the 20th behaved bravely without one exception. Some showed more than personal bravery‚Äîendurance, caution and a power of command. Captain Tremlett rescued his whole remaining company.\\"Letters of Nathan Hayward, Reports, Letters & Papers Appertaining to 20th Mass. Vol. Inf by Association of Officers of the 20th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry, Vol. 1, Pp. 347‚Äì348. After Ball's Bluff Henry was sent back to Boston to recruit replacements for his tattered regiment. = Peninsula Campaign = Tremlett's next action was the Peninsula Campaign. From April through July, 1862, he was part of an enormous force of approximately 121,000 troops that General George McClellan landed at Fort Monroe on the Virginia peninsula. McClellan's plan was to seize Richmond and thereby end the war, but instead he was turned back by General Robert E. Lee and eventually McClellan's entire army was driven from the peninsula. Tremlett's regiment fought at Eltham's Landing, Seven Pines, Oak Grove, Mechanicsville, Gaines' Mill, Savage's Station, Glendale, and Malvern Hill.  The Thirty-Ninth Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry Regiment  After the conclusion of the campaign, despite another defeat for the Union, he was promoted to the rank of major and reassigned to Company S of the Thirty-Ninth Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry Regimentunder Colonel P. Stearns Davis. The Thirty-Ninth was in the process of being formed up back in Lynnfield, Massachusetts, and in need of experienced combat officers as well as recruits so that the regiment could be brought up to fighting strength. Tremlett was assigned once again to draft rendezvous duty in Boston.Returns From U.S. Military Posts, 1800‚Äì1916, National Archives Microfilm Publication M617; Records of the Adjutant General's Office, 1780s‚Äì1917, Record Group 94, National Archives, Washington, DC. On September 6, 1862 the Thirty-Ninth broke camp and boarded trains bound for Washington. After some time in the capital, the regiment was charged with its primary responsibility of defending it, as some were concerned that Lee's army might attempt an incursion into Maryland, and if successful, move on Washington. The Thirty-Ninth was therefore ordered to march up the Potomac River into Maryland and establish camp at Poolesville, the same location from which the Twentieth Massachusetts had launched its ill-fated attack at Ball's Bluff the previous autumn. Henry probably found it sadly familiar. The rest of 1862 was uneventful if not boring for the Thirty-Ninth, consumed by picket duty, policing, and drills. The regiment remained in winter camp at Poolesville until April 1863, enduring a harsh winter consisting of protracted inclement weather, a good deal of it being snow. Though the frequent storms and cold temperatures were a hardship for the soldiers, not much in the way of fighting occurred, which was typical for both armies as winter was usually a time to regroup, reform, reinforce and stay warm and fed. On April 11, 1863, the Thirty-Ninth Regiment was ordered to return to Washington to once again more closely guard the capital. From that time through the end of 1863, Henry was assigned again to draft rendezvous duty back in Boston as provost marshal in charge of recruitment. = Petersburg = Lt. Col. Henry Martyn Tremlett, 39th Mass. Regiment, 1864 On July 10, 1864, Tremlett's three-year enlistment expired and he reenlisted. Still in Boston, he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel three days later due to the death of the Thirty-Ninth's commanding officer, Colonel Phineas Stearns Davis, and the severe wounding of Colonel Charles L. Peirson on July 11. Peirson had served with Tremlett in the Twentieth Massachusetts and had been captured at Ball's Bluff. Tremlett was promoted to colonel on January 5, 1865Schouler, William, Adjutant General of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, The Annual Report of the Adjutant General of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, for the year ending December 31, 1864, Boston: Wright & Potter, State Printers, 1865. and assigned as the new commanding officer of the Thirty-Ninth Regiment, Fifth Corps, which was camped in the center of the Union line outside Petersburg. On February 5, the Thirty- Ninth and the rest of the Fifth Corps were ordered to march west to Dinwiddie Courthouse and on the next day, to Hatcher's Run, located at the extreme left flank of the Union line. Here they established camp and remained, skirmishing sporadicly for most of the rest of the month of March. On March 29, Tremlett's regiment was marched alone further to the left and approached the Boydton Plank Road, an important Confederate transportation and communication hub. General Lee had moved General George Pickett's division to the far right of the Confederate line to face the Fifth Corps. Tremlett's regiment met the enemy and made some modest gains amid frequent skirmishing. On March 31 the Thirty-Ninth was ordered yet further left toward Gravelly Run where they encountered strong Confederate opposition. The Battle of Gravelly Run was also known as the Battle of White Oak Road, the Battle of Boydton Plank Road, and the Battle of Hatcher's Run. The Thirty-Ninth was in the forefront of the attack, having been assigned that position until the rest of Fifth Corps could be formed up, but, after initially suffering heavy casualties, the regiment fell back. Sometime early during the battle a mini√© ball struck Tremlett in the leg. As Adjutant General Schouler noted in his annual report, \\"Lieutenant- Colonel Tremlett was wounded soon after the engagement began, and was with much difficulty conveyed to the rear. It was found necessary at the hospital to amputate his leg at once.\\"Schouler, William, Adjutant General of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, The Annual Report of the Adjutant General of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, for the year ending December 31, 1865, Boston: Wright & Potter, State Printers, 1865. p. 531 Up until that day Tremlett had survived four years' service in the Union army. There were only ten days left until Appomattox. Death and legacy Back in Boston, Henry was hospitalized and received treatment over the course of several weeks before being discharged. He was considered to be recovering, and as a result he was returned to his home now on Beacon Hill. Not long after, he developed complications from his wound, not uncommon of this era, since without the benefit of antibiotics, the danger of sepsis after amputation was extreme. Two out of three deaths that occurred as a result of the war were attributable to disease, though most such deaths may have occurred as the result of wounds requiring amputation. Henry died about a month after the armistice, on June 6, 1865. The Thirty-Ninth Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry Regiment returned to Boston on the very same day. Henry's obituary in the Boston Post read: Death of Lieut. Colonel Tremlett.‚ÄîLieutenant Colonel Henry M. Tremlett, of the Thirty-ninth Massachusetts regiment, died in this city yesterday afternoon, from the effects of a wound received several weeks since in the campaign before Richmond. The wound was such that he was compelled to suffer the amputation of a leg, and though at first it seemed highly probable that he would recover, his enfeebled system was unable to endure the shock, and he died as above stated. Colonel Tremlett went to the war in 1861 as captain in the Twentieth regiment, from which he was promoted in August, 1862, as Major of the 39th regiment, and in July, 1864, received the commission of Lieutenant Colonel. Col. Tremlett was a brave and efficient officer and earned an excellent reputation in the field.Boston Post, Vol. LXVI, Nbr. 133, June 7, 1865, Boston, Massachusetts, p. 4. Alfred S. Roe, a member of the Thirty-Ninth Massachusetts, wrote in the roster section of his regimental history: Henry M. Tremlett, from Major July 13, 1864; absent at the time on detached service in Boston Harbor he did not rejoin the Regiment until October following; wd. March 31, 65, at Gravelly Run, he died of wounds at his home in Boston, June 6 following, the very day of the return of the Thirty-ninth. The six weeks immediately following the battle were spent in the hospital at City Point; thence he returned to Boston, getting there May 9, apparently on the road to recovery, but the setting in of intermittent fever proved to be too great a trial of his strength; his body was buried in Forest Hills Cemetery. Of him a writer in a Boston paper wrote at the time: His standard of manliness was one of noble action rather than of puling pretension, and his whole life showed him to be a loving son, a dear brother, a kind and generous companion, a devoted friend and a truly loyal man, willing.Roe, Alfred S., The Thirty-Ninth Regiment Massachusetts Volunteers 1862‚Äì1865, Regimental Veteran Association, Worcester, Massachusetts, 1914 Henry also received an eloquent tribute from Adjutant General George Schouler: The arrival home was saddened to the regiment by the death, immediately after, of its colonel, Henry M. Tremlett. He died at his home in Boston, from the effects of the wound received at Petersburg; but the blow was a sudden one to the regiment, from the favorable accounts which had been received from him from time to time. After a term of service extending back to Ball's Bluff, it seemed hard to lose him at the very end. In his death, the regiment lost a good commander, who had made himself loved by both officers and men, and respected by all, for his distinguished courage.Schouler, William, Adjutant General of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, The Annual Report of the Adjutant General of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, for the year ending December 31, 1865, Boston: Wright & Potter, State Printers, 1865, Pp. 533-534.

Posset was known beyond the borders of Bavaria above all as a critical local historian and in particular as a result of his pioneering work in connection with the Dachau subsidiary concentration camps of Landsberg/Kaufering and the preservation of the Kaufering VII concentration camp, today the European Holocaust Memorial.Bundeszentrale f√ºr politische Bildung ‚Äì Gedenkst√§tten f√ºr den Nationalsozialismus; http://www.bpb.de/system/files/pdf/5JOYKJ.pdf The Yad Vashem memorial awarded him the Yad Vashem Prize for his activities in connection with work of remembrance. Life Anton Posset studied history and the teaching of French at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, followed by internships in Lyon and Munich. He began his first teaching position in 1972, at the Simon-Marius- Gymnasium in Gunzenhausen, before then moving to the Dominikus-Zimmermann- Gymnasium in Landsberg am Lech in 1975. There, he dedicated himself to German- Jewish reconciliation and to addressing the history of the 20th century in postwar Germany. At that point in time, such an interest was not without considerable social taboos. The term \\"work of remembrance\\" was totally unfamiliar to large segments of the population. School research projects and the Citizens' Association Landsberg in the 20th Century Everything began with a secondary school student research project on the Kaufering concentration camp and the \\"Ringeltaube\\" defense project that he supervised, which Federal President Karl Carstens awarded first prize in the German History Student Competition in 1983/84. Anton Posset had already supervised six other student projects for this competition, which had repeatedly been awarded high-level prizes in this competition on a national level since 1976. In 1984 he also established the \\"Landsberg im 20. Jahrhundert ‚Äì B√ºrgervereinigung zur Erforschung der Landsberger Zeitgeschichte e.V.\\" (Citizens' Association‚ÄîLandsberg in the 20th Century) association, and served as its chairman for thirty years, until his death. As a result of his engagement and passionate dedication, with the assistance of the local Jewish businessman and Holocaust survivor Alexander Moksel, it became possible to purchase parts of the grounds of the Kaufering VII concentration camp that were still preserved. Under his leadership as chairman, the association persuaded the then Bavarian Minister President, Franz J. Strauss, of the value of making the last surviving earth huts at the former Kaufering VII Jewish concentration camp into a memorial, thus ensuring that their preservation was an objective in the \\"interest of the general public.\\"http://www.buergervereinigung- landsberg.de/umganggeschichte/stadtlandsberg/Posset/BriefStrauss.pdf Anton Posset was a driving force behind the further development of the Citizens' Association‚ÄîLandsberg in the 20th Century, as well as in the restoration and maintenance of the then-overgrown grounds of the Kaufering VII concentration camp. In 1989, he initiated the creation of the first Holocaust memorial in the Federal Republic of Germany, the European Holocaust Memorial, with the erection of commemorative stones by eleven European heads of state and the initiation of the \\"Weg der Menschenrechte und der Menschenw√ºrde\\" (Path of Human Rights and Human Dignity). In his activities as a secondary school teacher, he supervised students as a tutor in total of fourteen national history competitions. Three of these in-depth projects were awarded first prize. In the years 1975 to 1980, he was a member of the academic advisory board of the \\"German History\\" student competition and of the central jury of the K√∂rber-Stiftung, and established the regional jury for the history competition for Upper Bavaria, in Munich. He always had a sympathetic ear for the young people involved and gladly supported pupils and students with his advice. As an author and member of the editorial board for the \\"Themenhefte Landsberger Zeitgeschichte\\" (Special Issues on the Contemporary History of Landsberg) series of publications, he made a considerable contribution to the success of this series of journals. As a co-author and educator, he contributed his methodological and didactic expertise and experience to the four-volume history work Erinnern und Urteilen ‚Äì Unterrichtseinheiten Geschichte f√ºr Bayern (Remembrance and Judgment‚ÄîHistory Lessons for Bavaria) for the middle secondary school level under the rubric \\"discovery learning\\". For his dedication to German-Israeli reconciliation and work of remembrance, in Jerusalem in 1990, Yad Vashem awarded him the Yad Vashem Prize, the highest prize that the memorial awards to honor future generations. He presented the Das Ende des Holocaust in Bayern (The End of the Holocaust in Bavaria) exhibition at Beit Hatfutsot‚ÄîThe Museum of the Jewish People in Tel Aviv. In front of an audience of 400 individuals, he gave a lecture about the Kaufering concentration camp that was highly acclaimed in the Israeli press. Dov Shilansky, the Speaker of the Israeli Knesset at the time and a survivor of the Kaufering concentration camp, described Anton Posset as someone, \\"who can help Germany rise out of the depths and towards the light. If Germany truly regrets something and wants to compensate for what happened, it must be supported in doing so.\\" Collaboration with the team of the director/producer Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks in connection with the ten-part television miniseries Band of Brothers began in 2000. Based on Anton Posset's interviews and image material, for the film shooting in England, it was possible to reconstruct a subsidiary concentration camp, in which the liberation of the Jewish Kaufering/Landsberg concentration camp was then depicted and subsequently liberated by Allied troops in episode 9 (\\"Why we fight\\"). Oral history He collected a great deal of information in his many interviews with contemporary witnesses, including a large number of the survivors of the concentration camps around Landsberg. The perhaps most well known individual among them was Viktor Frankl, the neurologist and founder of logotherapy. Based on this information and historical documents from various archives, it became possible, above all in the 1990s, for various descendants of concentration camp survivors to clarify and/or reconstruct the history of their family members or their places of burial. Anton Posset's engagement and compiling of information also resulted in the inclusion of the engineer Walter Groos in the list of the Righteous Among the Nations at Yad Vashem. Over the course of the years, Anton Posset hence became an important contemporary witness himself. This led to the recording of a several-hour interview with him during one of his visits to Yad Vashem. Private Anton Posset was married to the artist H√©l√®ne Posset-Navarro. They have two sons. Dealing with work of remembrance In 1988, Joseph Rovan recommended to the Federal President that Anton Posset be awarded the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany for his exemplary commitment to work of remembrance. This recommendation received the support of the Federal President, but was nonetheless rejected by the Bavarian Minister President at the time, Max Streibl, due to massive intervention by local opposition.http://www.buergervereinigung- landsberg.de/umganggeschichte/stadtlandsberg/Posset/PossetRovan.pdf Ostracism, mobbing, and two reassignments as a teacher then followed. By the time he retired, Anton Posset's personnel file at the Bavarian Ministry of Education and the Arts had grown to comprise tens of thousands of pages.Mobbing in der Schule ‚Äì Probleme annehmen ‚Äì Konflikte l√∂sen,\\" Horst Kaspar, Verlag Beltz, 2nd edition, ; http://www.buergervereinigung- landsberg.de/umganggeschichte/schulen/mobbingaffaere.htm It was first at the start of the 21st century that his work of remembrance was finally belatedly accepted by society.

She served at the Battle of Jutland where she was sunk by British battleships. Construction In 1913, the Imperial German Navy placed orders for 12 high-seas torpedo boats, with a half-flotilla of six ordered from AG Vulcan (V25‚ÄìV30) and Schichau-Werke (S31‚ÄìS36). While the designs built by each shipyard were broadly similar, they differed from each other in detail, and were significantly larger and more capable than the small torpedo boats built for the German Navy in the last two years. S35 was one of the six torpedo-boats ordered from the Schichau-Werke. In June 1914, while still under construction, S35 and sister ship were sold to Greece, but were repossessed by Germany on 10 August 1914, following the outbreak of the First World War. S35 was launched at Schichau's Elbing shipyard on 30 August 1914 and commissioned on 4 December 1914. S35 was long overall and at the waterline, with a beam of and a draft of . Displacement was normal and deep load. Three oil-fired water-tube boilers fed steam to 2 sets of Schichau steam turbines rated at , giving a speed of . of fuel oil was carried, giving a range of at . Armament consisted of three 8.8 cm SK L/45 naval guns in single mounts, together with six 50 cm (19.7 in) torpedo tubes with two fixed single tubes forward and 2 twin mounts aft. Up to 24 mines could be carried. The ship had a complement of 83 officers and men. Service On 23 January 1915, a German force of Battlecruisers and light cruisers, escorted by torpedo boats, and commanded by Admiral Franz von Hipper, made a sortie to attack British fishing boats on the Dogger Bank. S35, part of the 18th Torpedo Boat Half-Flotilla, formed part of the escort for Hipper's force. British Naval Intelligence was warned of the raid by radio messages decoded by Room 40, and sent out the Battlecruiser Force from Rosyth, commanded by Admiral Beatty aboard and the Harwich Force of light cruisers and destroyers, to intercept the German force. The British and German Forces met on the morning of 24 January in the Battle of Dogger Bank. On sighting the British, Hipper ordered his ships to head south-east to escape the British, who set off in pursuit. The armoured cruiser was disabled by British shells and was sunk, but the rest of the German force escaped, with the German battlecruiser the British battlecruiser badly damaged. S35 took part in the Battle of the Gulf of Riga in August 1915. On 19 August, the torpedo boat was sunk by a mine west of Ruhnu, and boats from S35 and helped to rescue S31s crew. S35, as part of the 9th Torpedo Boat Flotilla, took part in the Bombardment of Yarmouth and Lowestoft on 24‚Äì25 April 1916, where she formed part of the escort for the battlecruisers of the I Scouting Group. At the Battle of Jutland on 31 May ‚Äì 1 June 1916, S35 was part of the 18th Half- Flotilla, 9th Torpedo Boat Flotilla, again operating in support of the I Scouting Group. The 9th Flotilla, including S35, took part in a torpedo attack on British battlecruisers from about 17:26 CET (16:26 GMT). The attack was disrupted by British destroyers, with the German torpedo boat hit by a torpedo from the British destroyer . S35, along with rescued V29s crew before V29 sank. was disabled by British shells in this clash and was scuttled by gunfire from . On the British side, the destroyer was disabled by a hit in the engine room and later sunk. Later during the day, at about 19:00 CET, the 9th Flotilla attempted another torpedo attack against British battlecruisers, which was curtailed by poor visibility and an attack by British destroyers. From about 20:15 CET (19:15 GMT), S35 took part in a large-scale torpedo attack by the 6th and 9th Torpedo Boat Flotillas on the British fleet in order to cover the outnumbered German battleships' turn to west. The German torpedo boats came under heavy fire from British battleships, and while S35 fired two torpedoes at the British line, she was hit by two heavy shells, probably from a salvo fired by the battleship s main armament. S35 broke in two and sank killing all 88 of her crew along with the survivors from V29 who were aboard. None of the torpedoes fired by the Germans found their targets, although several narrowly missed British battleships, forcing them to take avoiding action.

History The land area on which the center is located was once a deserted area before being developed as a military camp. In the 1950s, it was the site of a recruitment base. In 2003, the Kaohsiung City Government decided to transform the area into a national performance center. In 2007, the design firm Mecanoo Architecten won the design and construction rights. The preparatory office was also set up by the Cultural Construction Committee of the Executive Yuan on 15 March 2006. The construction for the main building was completed in 2012. Architecture National Kaohsiung Center for the Arts is designed Dutch architectural firm Mecanoo. The center was built on 9.9 hectares of land covering 3.3 hectares of floor area. The design of the center was inspired by the banyan trees around the area. The center houses four indoor venues, which are the Lyric Theater, Concert Hall, Playhouse and Recital Hall. The pipe organ in the concert hall was manufactured by Johannes Klais Orgelbau. With 9,194 pipes, this is the grandest organ in Asia. It is now the largest art avenue in the world. Transportation The art center is accessible from Weiwuying Station of Kaohsiung MRT.

It consists of live performances recorded during the band's original 1980‚Äì81 run and during their 1986 reunion. Background and recording The Adolescents had broken up in April 1989, after releasing their 1988 album Balboa Fun*Zone through Triple X Records. Live 1981 & 1986 was released later in 1989 by Triple X, consisting of previously-recorded live material mastered by Eddie Schreyer at Capitol Studios. The album's liner notes, written by singer Tony Brandenburg (here using the stage name Tony Montana) in May 1989, give a history of the band including several personal stories. The album does not state when or where the recorded performances occurred, nor which tracks are from which set of shows. Brandenburg's notes dedicate the album to, among others, \\"Rob Ritter (who recorded the Starwood show) ... and the guys in Connecticut and San Diego who taped the shows. I'm sorry, I forgot your names.\\" The Starwood was a venue in West Hollywood, California that operated from 1973 to June 1981. The liner notes include six fliers for Adolescents shows in the Greater Los Angeles Area, but do not state if the recordings on the album come from any of these shows: February 6, 1981 at the Oxnard Community Center with Rich Kids on LSD, Scared Straight, Sikki Velvet, and Apocalypse; March 24, 1981 at the Starwood with Eddie and the Subtitles and 45 Grave; May 13, 1981 at the Whisky a Go Go in West Hollywood with the Ozie-Hares; July 4, 1981 at Perkins Palace in Pasadena with Stiff Little Fingers and D.O.A.; and May 30, 1986 at Fender's Ballroom in Long Beach (two fliers are pictured, one advertising the supporting acts as the Weirdos, the Blackjax, and Subterfuge; the other listing the Weirdos, the Blackjax, the Hickoids, and Nomeansno). The album credits the performers as Tony Montana, Steve Soto, Casey Royer, and brothers Rikk, Frank, and Alfie Agnew. Montana, Soto, and Frank Agnew had founded the Adolescents in January 1980. Rikk Agnew and Royer had joined the band that June, and this lineup had recorded the group's debut album, Adolescents, also known as The Blue Album. Rikk Agnew left the band a few months after the album's April 1981 release, quitting mid-performance during a show at the Starwood. He was replaced by former Germs guitarist Pat Smear, who left the band that June and was replaced by Steve Roberts. This lineup recorded the Welcome to Reality EP, but the Adolescents broke up in August 1981, never having performed outside of California. The Blue Album lineup reunited for a show in April 1986 at Fender's Ballroom that led to the band re-forming, but Frank Agnew left the group after a few months and was replaced by his younger brother Alfie, then Royer left that August and was replaced by Sandy Hanson, formerly of the Mechanics. Release and reception Live 1981 & 1986 was released by Triple X Records in 1989 in LP, cassette, and compact disc formats. The cassette and CD versions include five additional tracks, with the last three labeled as \\"bonus tracks\\". In a retrospective review, Ned Raggett of AllMusic gave the album 3 stars out of 5, stating \\"the Adolescents rip through things with energy and attitude to burn, and come out winners each time. Fidelity isn't always the best, but it's much better than many tapes out there, with more emphasis on the treble than anything (though Soto's underrated bass-playing abilities come out more clearly here than on the original album, actually!).

The storm formed on 5 November and rapidly intensified two days later, reaching peak intensity on 7 November, due to a cold-core low aloft. Qendresa directly hit Malta in the afternoon and then crossed the eastern coast of Sicily on 8 November. Later, the cyclone weakened significantly and dissipated over Crete on 11 November. Academic sources indicate that Qendresa transitioned into a subtropical cyclone, prior to reaching peak intensity. Qendresa caused three fatalities, and at least $250 million (2014 USD) in damages in Italy. Meteorological history A shortwave trough near the British Isles started to expand southwards to North Africa on 3 November, which caused Lake Maggiore in Italy to overflow. Although the Institute of Meteorology of the Free University of Berlin had assigned the name Qendresa to an expected low-pressure area developed within the trough on 4 November, it actually gave the name to two different systems on 5 November, resulting in Qendresa I to the south and Qendresa II to the north. On 6 November, the southern tip of Qendresa I started to develop a low-level circulation centre (LLCC) near Kerkennah Islands, and it is referred to simply as Qendresa later by most of the documents and reports. The trough also developed two upper-level circulation centres (ULCCs) on the same day‚Äî the one near the southeastern coast of France quickly dissipated, yet the one in Algeria moved to Tunisia and then entered the Strait of Sicily the next day, becoming a cut-off low from the trough. When Qendresa's LLCC was moving north- northeastwards and combining with the ULCC early on 7 November, the system occluded quickly and intensified dramatically. Thanks to sea surface temperature over and the strong cold air at middle and upper levels, Qendresa formed an eye-like feature surrounded by deep convection near Linosa around noon. Shortly before 17:00 CET (16:00 UTC), Qendresa directly hit Malta, around which time Qendresa lost its fronts and acquired a more well-defined eye. MOLOCH, an Italian model, estimated that the low-level temperature of Qendresa's eye was about warmer than the surrounding area with the no longer cold middle and upper levels at that time, suggesting a warm-core system. Around this time, Qendresa was believed to have transitioned into a subtropical cyclone. At the peak intensity, Qendresa had a minimum low pressure of , maximum sustained winds of at least 110.9 km/h (68.9 mph; 59.9 kn), and maximum gusts of at least 153.7 km/h (95.5 mph; 83.0 kn). Interacting with Sicily, the cyclone turned northeastwards and started to make an anticlockwise loop to the east of the Italian island. On 8 November, Qendresa tracked along the coast of Catania and crossed Syracuse in the morning. It was significantly eroded because of the terrain of Sicily and increasing vertical wind shear, resulting a partially exposed and weakening system later. On 9 November, Qendresa lost its cold front, and weakened into a non-tropical low, near the island of Crete.http://www.met.fu- berlin.de/de/wetter/maps/Analyse_20141109.gif On 10 November, the system continued to decay, while moving over the island of Crete.http://www.met.fu- berlin.de/de/wetter/maps/Analyse_20141110.gif On 11 November, Qendresa dissipated over Crete.http://www.met.fu- berlin.de/de/wetter/maps/Analyse_20141111.gif Impact Qendresa near Sicily on 8 November, shortly after peak intensity Malta experienced a direct hit similar to a typical tropical cyclone from Qendresa. In St. Paul's Bay, a coastal town in northern Malta, the weather station of Buƒ°ibba recorded ten- minute sustained winds at 110.9 km/h (68.9 mph) and the gust at 153.7 km/h (95.5 mph) at 16:58 CET (15:58 UTC), the strongest recorded overland from a Mediterranean tropical-like cyclone in history; about 15 minutes later, the central pressure at 978.6 hPa (28.90 inHg) was recorded inside the eye with totally calm conditions, the lowest of all Mediterranean tropical-like cyclones since reliable records. Weather stations across other areas also recorded significant gusts from Qendresa. At Malta International Airport, it recorded the gust at 119 km/h (73.9 mph). Lampedusa, the largest island of the Italian Pelagie Islands, recorded the gust at 135 km/h (83.9 mph). Qendresa drowned 3 people in Italy, and caused at least 250 million GBP (2014 EURO) in damages. Qendresa caused chaos in Malta. Airport operations were suspended, and harbours were also closed. With many cars stalled in flooded streets throughout low-lying areas, the cyclone caused a traffic nightmare across the island. Power outages happened in several towns as electricity poles were brought down by strong winds; besides, many trees were uprooted. Qendresa brought similar damages to the eastern part of Sicily, including eroded coasts, blown off roofs, and overturned boats.

It was one of the Five Great Kilns of the Song dynasty recognised by later Chinese writers,Rawson, 246; Vainker, 93 but has remained rather mysterious to modern scholars, with much debate as to which surviving pieces, if any, actually are Ge ware,Krahl; Gompertz, 143‚Äì144, 150 whether they actually come from the Song, and where they were made.Vainker, 108; Kerr, Needham & Wood, 265‚Äì266 In recognition of this, many sources call all actual pieces Ge-type ware.For example the British Museum It is clear that their distinguishing feature is deliberate crackle, or a network of cracks in the glaze; but this is not restricted to them, and in particular the related Guan ware uses very similar effects. Ge ware often shows \\"double crackle\\" or crackle of two types, and one view is that this is the defining characteristic of the type.Nillson A three-day conference at the Shanghai Museum in 1992 attempted to reach a clear definition of Ge ware, but could not reconcile all views. History \\"Ge\\" () means \\"older brother\\" and the ware apparently takes its name from one of two potter Zhang brothers, from a story repeated in many sources from the Yuan onwards, with uncertain significance. They were both Longquan potters, perhaps in the Southern Song, though this is unclear. The elder brother developed a very special type of ware; the later sources say this was distinguished by crackled glaze, and Ge ware is supposed to be this type. The younger brother also developed a fine style of pottery, which is often taken to be the best quality early Longquan celadon.Gompertz, 150‚Äì156; Vainker, 108 Apparent pieces of Ge ware have been found in Yuan tombs, but not those from the Song, and increasingly the wares are regarded as a Yuan revival or replacement for Guan ware.Vainker, 108; Nillson Unlike Guan ware, it does not seem to have been produced for the court. There is a record of an incense- burner described as new being bought in 1355, close to the end of the Yuan, which compares it favourably to the \\"old\\" Guan ware.Kerr, Needham & Wood, 266 Production may well have continued into the early Ming dynasty.Rawson, 363 The term may have become used very loosely by the Ming period, for all southern celadons with a pronounced crackle, and such usage continued in the West, though in recent decades it is discouraged.Vandelstein, 105; Gompertz, 143‚Äì144, 150 Characteristics Jingdezhen porcelain, with single crackle pattern. The wares are closely related to Guan ware, also notable for crackle effects, and also Longquan celadon.Vainker, 108 Even more than in Guan ware, the glaze colour is an cream or ivory tending to grey or brown, with little green in it, although the wares come under the broad celadon grouping. The body is dark, and fired to stoneware in Western terms, and there are references in the traditional literature to the \\"purple mouth and iron[-coloured] foot\\" (), meaning the body is visible at the rim, where the glaze is thinner, and at the unglazed foot of vessels.Krahl; PDF.94 The crackle arises during cooling, when the coefficient of expansion differs between the glaze and the body, the former contracting faster.Medley, 156 A vase in the Percival David Foundation, now on loan to the British Museum, had a poem written on it by the Qianlong Emperor in 1785; in two senses, as he had the poem inscribed inside the neck of the vase:PDF.94 > Despite the pattern of hundreds of intermingling crackle lines, its texture > is fine and smooth to the touch. This is the work of the talented Elder > brother. One discovers that the value of these undecorated wares is the same > as that of unpolished gems. How could one compare this and the more > elaborate products of Xuan(de) and Cheng(hua)? Each has its own individual > charm. Composed by the Qianlong emperor in the cyclical year yisi [AD 1785] This vase, catalogued as PDF.94, has \\"double crackle\\", or two sizes of crackle glaze, one with wide and large crackle, the other with a finer network. Each set of cracks has had the effect heightened by applying a coloured stain, in different colours.PDF.94; Krahl There are multiple layers of glaze, and the wider crackle develops first, with the finer one developing inside those sections. The crackle may take some time to appear after firing, and is probably mainly caused by rapid cooling,Kerr, Needham & Wood, 266 and perhaps low silica in the glaze. A similar effect can be seen in the Beijing vase illustrated here. This form of double crackle is called \\"gold thread and iron wire\\" () in Chinese tradition, describing the small and larger networks respectively.Kerr, Needham & Wood, 266; Nillson Like other Song wares, Ge ware was skillfully copied in Jingdezhen porcelain under the Ming and Qing dynasties,Gompertz, 150, 204; Vainker, 108 as well as the 20th century, sometimes with the foot stained dark to resemble the originals.Nillson In these later periods, Ge ware became fashionable for the scholar's table and flower vases. The crackle was compared from the Ming onwards to cracking ice, with its suggestion of spring arriving, and evoked a line in the classic Daoist text the Dao De Jing describing a sage as \\"shrinking, as when ice melts\\".Hay, 136; cf. Dao De Jing 15 A range of fanciful names were devised by connoisseurs for different types of crackle: small \\"fish-egg pattern\\" (, and \\"ox-hair\\" (), willow-leaf (), and large \\"crab-claw\\" ().Hay, 137  Notes References *Gompertz, G.St.G.M., Chinese Celadon Wares, 1980 (2nd edn.), Faber & Faber, *Hay, Jonathan, Sensuous Surfaces: The Decorative Object in Early Modern China, 2010, Reaktion Books, , 9781861898463 *Kerr, Rose, Needham, Joseph, Wood, Nigel, Science and Civilisation in China: Volume 5, Chemistry and Chemical Technology, Part 12, Ceramic Technology, 2004, Cambridge University Press, , 9780521838337, google books *Krahl, Regina: Oxford Art Online, section \\"Guan and Ge wares\\" in \\"China, ¬ßVIII, 3: Ceramics: Historical development\\" *Medley, Margaret, The Chinese Potter: A Practical History of Chinese Ceramics, 3rd edition, 1989, Phaidon, *Nillson, Jan-Eric, \\"Ge (Wade-Giles: ko) ware\\", in Chinese porcelain glossary, Gotheborg.com *\\"PDF.94\\": British Museum page, PDF.94 (expand two sets of comments) *Rawson, Jessica (ed).

Life Annedore Grafe was born into a peasant family in Neubarnim (Letschin) in a rural region on the left bank of the Oder river, at that time part of the Soviet occupation zone, and on the \\"German\\" side of the newly repositioned frontier with Poland. She attended the local school between 1954 and 1964, and then undertook a traneeship in animal husbandry, till 1967 at the agriculture college in Neuenhagen a short distance to the east of Berlin. In 1967 she moved on to the prestigious \\"Bruno Leuschner\\" Economic Academy in Berlin. However, after a year she voluntarily abandoned her course and in 1968 took work at a Berlin orphanage. In 1973 she successfully completed a training as a home educationist in Hohenprie√ünitz (near Leipzig). By this time, back in Berlin, she had become part of a circle of intellectuals - artists and writers - critical of the ruling party. She first met the scientist and high-profile political and civil rights activist Robert Havemann (1910‚Äì1982) in 1970 at the apartment of the songwriter Wolf Biermann, another prominent political dissident. She married Havemann in 1974. Their daughter Franziska had been born the previous year. Annedore Grafe marked her marriage by changing not merely her family name but also her first name: Annedore Grafe now became Katja Havemann. Katja Havemann supported her husband in his dangerous work as a political writer in the German Democratic Republic and shared in the mounting surveillance and other destructive actions to which they were routinely subjected by officers of the Ministry for State Security, including slightly more than two years under house arrest between 1976 and 1979. In numerous critical articles and quotations that appeared in the western media, Robert Havemann's managed to share the basis of his opposition to the political structure in East Germany. His opposition centred on the assertion of one-party power by the SED (party) in the German Democratic Republic. He rejected this as dogmatic and undemocratic. During the 1970s and 1980s there were times when she stayed at home as a \\"housewife\\", while at other times she supported the family budget working variously as a home educator, in a motor vehicle service centre and in a small ceramics factory which by 1982 she had set up with her friend and political ally, the artist B√§rbel Bohley. Over the years Katja Havemann established political contacts with numerous opposition figures in East Germany. Thirty-seven years younger than her husband, she was widowed in 1982, after which she continued with her political opposition to the SED r√©gime. In 1982 she was a co-founder in East Germany of \\"Women for Peace\\" (\\"Frauen f√ºr den Frieden\\"), together with Ulrike Poppe und B√§rbel Bohley. Inspiration for the initiative came from the Women's Peace Movement in Northern Ireland and, more immediately, from an enhanced military service law in East Germany which was enacted, without warning or prior discussion, by the national parliament (\\"Volkskammer\\") on 25 March 1982, and which opened the way for women to be subject to compulsory military conscription. In 1986 Katja Havemann became a member of the newly emerging Initiative for Peace and Human Rights, widely seen as the first East German opposition group established outside the state and he church, and thereby a precursor to surge in street protests and other changes which led to German reunification, formally in October 1990. In 1989 Katja Havemann still lived at Gr√ºnheide on the eastern edge of Berlin, in the house where she had made her home with her husband, and it was here on 10 September 1989 that together with B√§rbel Bohley und Rolf Henrich she founded the \\"citizen's movement\\", New Forum. In some respects New Forum was a cross between a political party and a mass organisation. However, in East Germany political parties and mass movements were controlled by the ruling SED (party). New Forum was not. In the couple of months that followed it gave a decisive impulse to what became known as the Peaceful Revolution, including the end of the one- party state power structure and, slightly more than a year after New Forum's foundation, the \\"accession\\" of the German Democratic Republic into an (enlarged and, over time, adapted) German Federal Republic. One important reason that New Forum caught the spirit of the times and developed so rapidly involved growing awareness and indignation over the obvious falsification of East German election results which, starting on 4 September 1989, gave rise to a sustained surge in the street protests. In September 1990, during the immediate build-up to reunification, Katja Havemann was one of around 20 activist demonstrators who barricaded themselves inside the building of the former Stasi main office alongside the Normannenstra√üe in East Berlin. The object of the exercise was to ensure the contents of the Stasi files remained accessible for future political and historical research. There was a real concern that the Stasi archives would either be quietly destroyed or else disappear into an archive and remain inaccessible to researchers and to the millions of East German citizens whom, it was correctly presumed, they directly concerned. The demonstrators backed up their demands with a hunger strike, and gained massive support from the population, the media, and politicians as news of their action spread. Equivalent popular actions took place in other cities, in order to try and prevent former Stasi officers from incinerating the vast quantities of paper-based records accumulated during four decades. On 3 October 1990, just hours before the formal implementation of reunification, the authorities agreed to the demonstrators' demands, which were enshrined in the Stasi Records Law which came into force the next year, and the creation of the Stasi Records Agency. During the early 1990s she withdrew from politics, focusing instead on various projects involving handicapped and other disadvantaged young people. She nevertheless also joined with other political activists from the \\"GDR times\\" in campaigning against cover-up strategies of former Stasi officers and collaborators. In addition, she became particularly engaged in the debates surrounding the presumed, albeit vehemently denied, backstairs entanglements of the former SED (party) politician Gregor Gysi who successfully relaunched himself as a leading PDS (left-wing party) reformer, following the demise of the German Democratic Republic. Havemann's demands for greater transparency from Gysi about his past appear to have been intensified because during the 1970s and 1980s, as a defence attorney, Gysi had represented the Havemanns and several of their dissident comrades in East German courts. Between 1995 and 2000 Katja Havemann was the leading prosecution witness in a criminal case at the regional courts in Frankfurt (Oder) and Neuruppin. The cases involved two lawyers who, acting under the influence of the SED (party) and, more specifically, between 1976 and 1979 under the direction of the Ministry for State Security (\\"Stasi\\"), had sentenced her husband to house arrest \\"for disturbing public order and security\\" (wegen \\"St√∂rung der √∂ffentlichen Ordnung und Sicherheit\\"), and to a fine for \\"currency transactions\\" in connection with payments received for his articles in the western media. The outcomes of the cases were convictions for the two former government lawyers, who had received suspended sentences. Invited to criticise the leniency of the sentence, Havemann assured an interviewer that her motive had been for justice, not revenge. What was important for her was that it had finally been established that Erich Honecker had not been the only person responsible for injustices in the German Democratic Republic (\\"...dass endlich festgestellt wurde, dass nicht nur Honecker verantwortlich f√ºr Unrecht in der DDR war\\"). It had been possible for the system to function as it did only \\"because many people knowingly involved themselves\\" (\\"weil viele ganz bewusst mitmachten\\").

Transferred to the Royal Canadian Navy in 1942, the minesweeper saw service on both the West and East Coasts of Canada as a convoy escort and patrol vessel. The vessel participated in the invasion of Normandy and spent the final years of the war in European waters. Canso was returned to the Royal Navy following the war and was broken up for scrap in 1948. Design and description A British design, the Bangor-class minesweepers were smaller than the preceding s in British service, but larger than the in Canadian service.Chesneau, p. 64Macpherson and Barrie (2002), p. 177 They came in two versions powered by different engines; those with a diesel engines and those with vertical triple-expansion steam engines. Canso was of the latter design and was larger than her diesel-engined cousins. Canso was long overall, had a beam of and a draught of . The minesweeper had a displacement of . She had a complement of 6 officers and 77 enlisted. Canso had two vertical triple-expansion steam engines, each driving one shaft, using steam provided by two Admiralty three-drum boilers. The engines produced a total of and gave a maximum speed of . The minesweeper could carry a maximum of of fuel oil. British Bangor-class minesweepers were armed with a single 12-pounder () 12 cwt HA gun mounted forward. For anti-aircraft purposes, the minesweepers were equipped with one QF 2-pounder Mark VIII and two single- mounted QF 20 mm Oerlikon guns.Macpherson (1997), p. 38 The 2-pounder gun was later replaced with a twin 20 mm Oerlikon mount. As a convoy escort, Canso was deployed with 40 depth charges launched from two depth charge throwers and four chutes. Operational history The minesweeper was ordered as part of the British 1940 construction programme. The ship's keel was laid down on 30 December 1940 by North Vancouver Ship Repairs at their yard in North Vancouver, British Columbia. Named for a community in Nova Scotia, Canso was launched on 9 June 1941. Transferred to the Royal Canadian Navy, the ship was commissioned on 5 March 1942 at Vancouver. Following work ups, the minesweeper joined Esquimalt Force in May 1942, the local patrol and convoy escort force operating out of Esquimalt, British Columbia. Canso was one of the warships added to the west coast patrol force after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. The main duty of Bangor-class minesweepers after commissioning on the West Coast was to perform the Western Patrol. This consisted of patrolling the west coast of Vancouver Island, inspecting inlets and sounds and past the Scott Islands to Gordon Channel at the entrance to the Queen Charlotte Strait and back.Douglas et al., No Higher Purpose, pp. 349, 352 In July 1943, Canso was transferred to the Atlantic Coast, arriving on 19 August at Halifax, Nova Scotia and joined Halifax Force upon arrival, the local patrol and escort force. She remained with the unit until February 1944 when the minesweeper was sent to European waters as part of Canada's contribution to the invasion of Normandy. After arriving at Plymouth on 7 March, Canso was assigned during the lead-up to the invasion to the 32nd and 16th Minesweeping Flotillas. Canso was with the 16th Minesweeping Flotilla on D-day was assigned to the assault sweep during the landings on 6 June. The 16th Minesweeping Flotilla was detailed with clearing channel 1 in the American sector.Schull, p. 267 The minesweepers completed their work unmolested by the Germans ashore.Schull, p. 272 Their work completed, the minesweeper returned to Plymouth, sailing for the invasion zone again the next day. The 16th Minesweeping Flotilla spent the following weeks sweeping the invasion zone and the sea lanes to it. On 16 June they swept a channel in front of the cruiser , which was carrying King George VI to Normandy.Schull, pp. 276, 322 In August 1944, the minesweeper sailed for Canada to undergo a refit at Saint John, New Brunswick. Following the refit, Canso returned to European waters. She joined the 31st Minesweeping Flotilla upon her return and took part in the last large-scale combined operation in the European theatre in an attack on German naval bases in France that had been left untouched by Allied war effort to that point. Departing Plymouth on 12 April 1945, the 31st Minesweeping Flotilla began operations in the mouth of the Gironde estuary on 14 April. They completed their duties on 16 April, unmolested by the Germans. While returning to Plymouth, the flotilla encountered a German trawler and captured it.Schull, pp. 395‚Äì96 Canso and the 31st Minesweeping Flotilla spent the next five months sweeping the English Channel.Douglas et al., A Blue Water Navy, p. 337 The minesweeper was paid off on 24 September 1945 and returned to the Royal Navy.

Its ancestry traces to the Tang Dynasty, influenced by the Tibetan Pony, the Ferghana and the Mongolian horse. It was given its present name in 1954, from the Chinese word for its native region on the first loop of the Yellow River. Once common, the Hequ fell victim to Chinese policy and the mechanization of transportation. It is divided into three types: the Jiaoke, the Suoke, and Kesheng. It has remarkable physiological adaptation, following strong pressure from natural selection, allowing them to live in hypoxic environments (in) the Tibetan plateau at altitudes of 4000 m. The Hequ shows great versatility, being present as at Tibetan local races for the religious use or herd management. The Chinese authorities are seeking to develop its livestock for meat. The breed remains common; thousands of these horses are still commonly found in areas of Maqu, Luqu and Xiahe. Nomenclature The breed was officially named \\"Hequ\\" in 1954 by the Northwest Livestock Office of China, but locally there are other names such as \\"Tangke\\", \\"Qiaoke\\" and \\"Nanfan\\". Nafan was most often used in 1954. The name \\"Hequ\\" is a reference to the Chinese name of the first loop of the Yellow River, which forms the cradle of breed. Since 1954, only the official name is customary. In Russian, this horse is named \\"Khetsyui\\". It is often confused, wrongly, with the Tibetan pony. Characteristics The Hequ is alternately described as a saddle horse and a light draft horse. It is a small horse measuring , weighing , with good conformation. The head is of medium length, with a straight profile. Fine, it features very mobile eyes. The ears are long, wide and well open nostrils. The muzzle is small, and the neck is medium to short, thick, sloping and well connected to shoulders, which are well-sloped. The chest is broad and deep, the back tends to be long, and the croup is slightly sloping. The hoof is wide, but not as strong as it should. The most common dresses are black, bay and gray dress being united principle. Mares mature at two years old and are able to reproduce at three. They can give birth to 12 or 13 foals in their lives. The fertility rate is 70%, but can go up to 80 or even 90% with appropriate care. Types Three varieties are distinguished in the breed: the Jiaoke (or Jiaode), the Suoke and Kesheng. The Jiaoke is from Southern Gansu, it is the heaviest variety. The head is broader and it sometimes has hoof soundness problems. The predominant color is gray. The Suoke comes from western Sichuan. The head is broad and coupling is short. They carry their tails high, similar to art from the Tang Dynasty. The Kesheng comesfrom the Kesheng Autonomous Region. It is further influenced by the Mongolian horse. Temperament and maintenance The Hequ is particularly rustic. High at elevations ranging from 3000 to 5000 meters, it supports low temperatures, snowfall seven months of the year and rain during the summer. He quickly gains weight in summer, and loses its fat slower fall and winter than other horses. Its adaptation to extreme environmental conditions was the subject of an analysis published in PLOS ONE, concluding that it probably comes from a long evolution that favored the ability to handle low oxygen. This has made the Hequ suited to hypoxic environments (in). It thus has significant genetic and morphological differences from the horses lower altitudes. A study at the University of Gansu (published only in Chinese) reaches the same conclusion: the cold and low oxygen levels cause a visible physiological adaptation, particularly in terms of size, chest width and color skin. In 2000, the composition of the pastures frequented the horses were analyzed, especially their mineral content and composition of blood Hequ. The results indicate that the levels of selenium and zinc are significantly inferior to the standard nutritional requirements of other breeds of horses. Breeding and genetics The Hequ is considered one of the seven major Chinese groups of horses. They are considered by the Chinese to be a superior type of horse, including its size, higher than that of most of China's native horses. This breed is the subject of a selection in several breeding centers, to improve it. A study published in the Journal of Heredity has determined the breed to be a part of the Qinghai horse group of the Tibetan plateau, which is part Hequ with Chaidamu, Datong and Yushu. It has the lowest number of alleles (6.74) among the 28 breeds studied for the purposes of a comparison between Chinese horses, published in Animal Genetics. Six haplotypes were identified in horses Gansu. Cluster E is only present in the Hequ, which probably has the same origin as the Qilian mother horse. This study published in the Journal of Agricultural Biotechnology concluded (2014) that it is potentially a descendant of the Przewalski horse. Another study focused on the composition of testicular fibroblast Hequ standards (in 2012), showing that \\"the horse is Hequ a major national genetic resource stored at the cellular level, which will provide an ideal experimental material for genetic studies.\\" History The Hequ originates from the time of the Sping Period, by the state of Chin. It is most often used to mount war. The feudal king of Chin ordered the creation of a stud farm to breed cavalry mounts. Many horses are imported from West Asia and crossed with local animals. The Hequ is strongly influenced by the horse called \\"Dawan,\\" which seems to be the same as the Ferghana horse. In the Yuan Dynasty, the Hequ is crossed with the mounts of Mongol tribe Xianbei, which invade the current province of Qinghai. In the nineteenth century the Hequ is imported from southern Qinghai to the north of that province to be crossed with the Datong to improve it. From 1934, some Hequ crossed to give the Shandan race. During the census in 1980, the Hequ is one of the most common breeds of horses on the territory of China, with 180 000 head. However, the census FAO gives a different figure of around 60 000 head in 1982. In the early 1990s, Chinese researchers discuss measures to technically control the breeding of horses Hequ, so set a retention region and selecting a reference herd. This breed is considered in decline since the late twentieth century. The major cause of this decline is related to the local Chinese policy, which instead encourages the breeding of sheep and yak. The other reason is to be found in the modernization of transport modes, young farmers and shepherds opting more often for a motorcycle or a moped to get around, to the detriment of the horse. In 2005, a quick survey of older Tibetans reveals they regret these changes, and fear that the horse will eventually disappear completely. Uses The Hequ is very versatile, its ability to cross the mountainous areas and wetlands is recognized.need page numbers It is mainly used for light-draft work and mounted by Tibetan mountain shepherds, although the latter use is scarce. Sometimes it is saddled or harnessed for transportation and agricultural work. Its traction abilities are quite good, with a strong capacity for endurance. However, speed is moderate. They recover quickly after exercise. Racing and traditional uses The Hequ remains associated with a religious and folk use to carry the reincarnated lama, or to participate in local horse racing. Maqu races are especially popular and attract hundreds of thousands of spectators came to see the riders compete in the region. These are endurance races, carried over distances ranging from 1 to 10 km. This horse is now valued in the context of tourism, the use of Hequ being considered deeply rooted in Tibetan culture. Some Tibetan herders have their horse as their \\"best friend\\". Meat production Several Chinese studies begun in 1989 and published in 1993 in the Journal of Gansu Agricultural University focused on the suitability of the breed for meat production. Among horses present in China, the Hequ is one of those with the best qualities for this purpose, the average percentage of recovered meat on the carcass being 79.42%. By its general appearance, Hequ has a conformation close to the desired kind on the market, including an elongated body, bones thin and has a layer of fat under the skin during the cold season. Chinese researchers believe necessary to select meat lines among this breed. The analysis of the composition of meat Hequ focused on its nutritional value, which is characterized by a high protein content (22.8%) and a very low fat (4.96%). The study adds that ethnic customs recede (and with them the traditional uses of this breed), and the breeding of horses for meat \\"is not accepted by the masses.\\" Dissemination of livestock The Hequ is considered by the study from the University of Uppsala (2010) as a local breed which is not endangered. According to the FAO assessment conducted in 2007, this horse is common. Considered one of the native breeds of China and very famous in all countries, its breed cradle yet situated in a culturally Tibetan region, northwest of the Tibetan plateau, just near the first loop of the Yellow River at the crossroads of the provinces of Qinghai, Sichuan and Gansu. The population of Hequ has been eroded in the early twenty-first century, the number of horses being estimated to be in the range between 16 000 and 50 000 head. This horse is still found quite commonly in Maqu xian, who would conceal about 30 000 in 2012. It is also common in Xiahe xian and Luqu.

In numerical mathematics, the gradient discretisation method (GDM) is a framework which contains classical and recent numerical schemes for diffusion problems of various kinds: linear or non-linear, steady-state or time-dependent. The schemes may be conforming or non-conforming, and may rely on very general polygonal or polyhedral meshes (or may even be meshless). Some core properties are required to prove the convergence of a GDM. These core properties enable complete proofs of convergence of the GDM for elliptic and parabolic problems, linear or non-linear. For linear problems, stationary or transient, error estimates can be established based on three indicators specific to the GDM R. Eymard, C. Guichard, and R. Herbin. Small-stencil 3d schemes for diffusive flows in porous media. M2AN, 46:265‚Äì290, 2012. (the quantities C_{D}, S_{D} and W_{D}, see below). For non-linear problems, the proofs are based on compactness techniques and do not require any non-physical strong regularity assumption on the solution or the model data.J. Droniou, R. Eymard, T. Gallou√´t, and R. Herbin. Gradient schemes: a generic framework for the discretisation of linear, nonlinear and nonlocal elliptic and parabolic equations. Math. Models Methods Appl. Sci. (M3AS), 23(13):2395‚Äì2432, 2013. Non-linear models for which such convergence proof of the GDM have been carried out comprise: the Stefan problem which is modelling a melting material, two-phase flows in porous media, the Richards equation of underground water flow, the fully non-linear Leray‚ÄîLions equations.J. Leray and J. Lions. Quelques r√©sultats de Vi≈°ik sur les probl√®mes elliptiques non lin√©aires par les m√©thodes de Minty-Browder. Bull. Soc. Math. France, 93:97‚Äì107, 1965. Any scheme entering the GDM framework is then known to converge on all these problems. This applies in particular to conforming Finite Elements, Mixed Finite Elements, nonconforming Finite Elements, and, in the case of more recent schemes, the Discontinuous Galerkin method, Hybrid Mixed Mimetic method, the Nodal Mimetic Finite Difference method, some Discrete Duality Finite Volume schemes, and some Multi-Point Flux Approximation schemes The example of a linear diffusion problem Consider Poisson's equation in a bounded open domain \\\\Omega\\\\subset \\\\mathbb{R}^d, with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition :\\\\quad (1) \\\\qquad \\\\qquad -\\\\Delta \\\\overline{u} = f, where f\\\\in L^2(\\\\Omega). The usual sense of weak solution H. Brezis. Functional analysis, Sobolev spaces and partial differential equations. Universitext.

In a nutshell, the GDM for such a model consists in selecting a finite-dimensional space and two reconstruction operators (one for the functions, one for the gradients) and to substitute these discrete elements in lieu of the continuous elements in (2). More precisely, the GDM starts by defining a Gradient Discretization (GD), which is a triplet D = (X_{D,0},\\\\Pi_D, abla_D), where: * the set of discrete unknowns X_{D,0} is a finite dimensional real vector space, * the function reconstruction \\\\Pi_D~:~X_{D,0}\\\\to L^2(\\\\Omega) is a linear mapping that reconstructs, from an element of X_{D,0}, a function over \\\\Omega, * the gradient reconstruction abla_D~:~X_{D,0}\\\\to L^2(\\\\Omega)^d is a linear mapping which reconstructs, from an element of X_{D,0}, a \\"gradient\\" (vector-valued function) over \\\\Omega. This gradient reconstruction must be chosen such that \\\\Vert abla_D \\\\cdot \\\\Vert_{L^2(\\\\Omega)^d} is a norm on X_{D,0}. The related Gradient Scheme for the approximation of (2) is given by: find u\\\\in X_{D,0} such that :\\\\quad (3) \\\\qquad \\\\qquad \\\\forall v \\\\in X_{D,0},\\\\qquad \\\\int_{\\\\Omega} abla_D u(x)\\\\cdot abla_D v(x) dx = \\\\int_{\\\\Omega} f(x)\\\\Pi_D v(x) dx. The GDM is then in this case a nonconforming method for the approximation of (2), which includes the nonconforming finite element method. Note that the reciprocal is not true, in the sense that the GDM framework includes methods such that the function abla_D u cannot be computed from the function \\\\Pi_D u. The following error estimate, inspired by G. Strang's second lemma,G. Strang. Variational crimes in the finite element method. In The mathematical foundations of the finite element method with applications to partial differential equations (Proc. Sympos., Univ. Maryland, Baltimore, Md., 1972), pages 689‚Äì710.

Note that the following upper and lower bounds of the approximation error can be derived: :\\\\quad (9) \\\\qquad \\\\qquad \\\\begin{align} &&\\\\frac 1 2 [S_D(\\\\overline{u}) + W_D( abla \\\\overline{u})] \\\\ &\\\\le & \\\\Vert \\\\overline{u} - \\\\Pi_D u_D\\\\Vert_{L^2(\\\\Omega)} + \\\\Vert abla \\\\overline{u} - abla_D u_D\\\\Vert_{L^2(\\\\Omega)^d} \\\\ &\\\\le &(C_D+2) [S_D(\\\\overline{u}) + W_D( abla \\\\overline{u})].\\\\end{align} Then the core properties which are necessary and sufficient for the convergence of the method are, for a family of GDs, the coercivity, the GD-consistency and the limit-conformity properties, as defined in the next section. More generally, these three core properties are sufficient to prove the convergence of the GDM for linear problems and for some nonlinear problems like the p-Laplace problem. For nonlinear problems such as nonlinear diffusion, degenerate parabolic problems..., we add in the next section two other core properties which may be required. The core properties allowing for the convergence of a GDM Let (D_m)_{m\\\\in\\\\mathbb{N}} be a family of GDs, defined as above (generally associated with a sequence of regular meshes whose size tends to 0).  Coercivity  The sequence (C_{D_m})_{m\\\\in\\\\mathbb{N}} (defined by (6)) remains bounded.  GD-consistency  For all \\\\varphi\\\\in H^1_0(\\\\Omega), \\\\lim_{m\\\\to\\\\infty} S_{D_m} (\\\\varphi) = 0 (defined by (7)).  Limit-conformity  For all \\\\varphi\\\\in H_\\\\operatorname{div}(\\\\Omega), \\\\lim_{m\\\\to\\\\infty} W_{D_m}(\\\\varphi) = 0 (defined by (8)). This property implies the coercivity property.  Compactness (needed for some nonlinear problems) For all sequence (u_m)_{m\\\\in\\\\mathbb{N}} such that u_m \\\\in X_{D_m,0} for all m\\\\in\\\\mathbb{N} and (\\\\Vert u_m \\\\Vert_{D_m})_{m\\\\in\\\\mathbb{N}} is bounded, then the sequence (\\\\Pi_{D_m} u_m)_{m\\\\in\\\\mathbb{N}} is relatively compact in L^2(\\\\Omega) (this property implies the coercivity property).  Piecewise constant reconstruction (needed for some nonlinear problems) Let D = (X_{D,0}, \\\\Pi_D, abla_D) be a gradient discretisation as defined above. The operator \\\\Pi_D is a piecewise constant reconstruction if there exists a basis (e_i)_{i\\\\in B} of X_{D,0} and a family of disjoint subsets (\\\\Omega_i)_{i\\\\in B} of \\\\Omega such that \\\\Pi_D u = \\\\sum_{i\\\\in B}u_i\\\\chi_{\\\\Omega_i} for all u=\\\\sum_{i\\\\in B} u_i e_i\\\\in X_{D,0}, where \\\\chi_{\\\\Omega_i} is the characteristic function of \\\\Omega_i. Some non-linear problems with complete convergence proofs of the GDM We review some problems for which the GDM can be proved to converge when the above core properties are satisfied.  Nonlinear stationary diffusion problems  :\\\\quad \\\\qquad \\\\qquad -\\\\operatorname{div}(\\\\Lambda(\\\\overline{u}) abla \\\\overline{u}) = f In this case, the GDM converges under the coercivity, GD-consistency, limit-conformity and compactness properties.  p-Laplace problem for p > 1 :\\\\quad \\\\qquad \\\\qquad -\\\\operatorname{div}( abla \\\\overline{u}^{p-2} abla \\\\overline{u}) = f In this case, the core properties must be written, replacing L^2(\\\\Omega) by L^p(\\\\Omega), H^1_0(\\\\Omega) by W^{1,p}_0(\\\\Omega) and H_\\\\operatorname{div}(\\\\Omega) by W_\\\\operatorname{div}^{p'}(\\\\Omega) with \\\\frac 1 p +\\\\frac 1 {p'}=1, and the GDM converges only under the coercivity, GD- consistency and limit-conformity properties.  Linear and nonlinear heat equation  :\\\\quad \\\\qquad \\\\qquad \\\\partial_t \\\\overline{u}- \\\\operatorname{div}(\\\\Lambda (\\\\overline{u}) abla \\\\overline{u}) = f In this case, the GDM converges under the coercivity, GD-consistency (adapted to space-time problems), limit-conformity and compactness (for the nonlinear case) properties.  Degenerate parabolic problems  Assume that \\\\beta and \\\\zeta are nondecreasing Lipschitz continuous functions: :\\\\quad \\\\qquad \\\\qquad \\\\partial_t \\\\beta(\\\\overline{u})-\\\\Delta \\\\zeta(\\\\overline{u}) = f Note that, for this problem, the piecewise constant reconstruction property is needed, in addition to the coercivity, GD-consistency (adapted to space-time problems), limit-conformity and compactness properties. Review of some numerical methods which are GDM All the methods below satisfy the first four core properties of GDM (coercivity, GD-consistency, limit-conformity, compactness), and in some cases the fifth one (piecewise constant reconstruction). Galerkin methods and conforming finite element methods Let V_h\\\\subset H^1_0(\\\\Omega) be spanned by the finite basis (\\\\psi_i)_{i\\\\in I}. The Galerkin method in V_h is identical to the GDM where one defines *X_{D,0} = { u = (u_i)_{i\\\\in I} } = \\\\mathbb{R}^I, *\\\\Pi_D u = \\\\sum_{i\\\\in I} u_i \\\\psi_i * abla_D u = \\\\sum_{i\\\\in I} u_i abla\\\\psi_i. In this case, C_D is the constant involved in the continuous Poincar√© inequality, and, for all \\\\varphi\\\\in H_\\\\operatorname{div}(\\\\Omega), W_{D}(\\\\varphi) = 0 (defined by (8)). Then (4) and (5) are implied by C√©a's lemma. The \\"mass-lumped\\" P^1 finite element case enters the framework of the GDM, replacing \\\\Pi_D u by \\\\widetilde{\\\\Pi}_D u = \\\\sum_{i\\\\in I} u_i \\\\chi_{\\\\Omega_i}, where \\\\Omega_i is a dual cell centred on the vertex indexed by i\\\\in I. Using mass lumping allows to get the piecewise constant reconstruction property.  Nonconforming finite element  On a mesh T which is a conforming set of simplices of \\\\mathbb{R}^d, the nonconforming P^1 finite elements are defined by the basis (\\\\psi_i)_{i\\\\in I} of the functions which are affine in any K\\\\in T, and whose value at the centre of gravity of one given face of the mesh is 1 and 0 at all the others (these finite elements are used in [Crouzeix et al]M. Crouzeix and P.-A. Raviart. Conforming and nonconforming finite element methods for solving the stationary Stokes equations. I. Rev. Fran√ßaise Automat. Informat. Recherche Op√©rationnelle S√©r. Rouge, 7(R-3):33‚Äì75, 1973. for the approximation of the Stokes and Navier-Stokes equations). Then the method enters the GDM framework with the same definition as in the case of the Galerkin method, except for the fact that abla\\\\psi_i must be understood as the \\"broken gradient\\" of \\\\psi_i, in the sense that it is the piecewise constant function equal in each simplex to the gradient of the affine function in the simplex.  Mixed finite element  The mixed finite element method consists in defining two discrete spaces, one for the approximation of abla \\\\overline{u} and another one for \\\\overline{u}.P.-A. Raviart and J. M. Thomas. A mixed finite element method for 2nd order elliptic problems. In Mathematical aspects of finite element methods (Proc. Conf., Consiglio Naz. delle Ricerche (C.N.R.), Rome, 1975), pages 292‚Äì315. Lecture Notes in Math., Vol. 606. Springer, Berlin, 1977. It suffices to use the discrete relations between these approximations to define a GDM. Using the low degree Raviart‚ÄìThomas basis functions allows to get the piecewise constant reconstruction property.  Discontinuous Galerkin method  The Discontinuous Galerkin method consists in approximating problems by a piecewise polynomial function, without requirements on the jumps from an element to the other.D. A. Di Pietro and A. Ern. Mathematical aspects of discontinuous Galerkin methods, volume 69 of Math√©matiques & Applications (Berlin) [Mathematics & Applications]. Springer, Heidelberg, 2012. It is plugged in the GDM framework by including in the discrete gradient a jump term, acting as the regularization of the gradient in the distribution sense.  Mimetic finite difference method and nodal mimetic finite difference method  This family of methods is introduced by [Brezzi et al]F. Brezzi, K. Lipnikov, and M. Shashkov. Convergence of the mimetic finite difference method for diffusion problems on polyhedral meshes. SIAM J. Numer. Anal., 43(5):1872‚Äì1896, 2005. and completed in [Lipnikov et al].K. Lipnikov, G. Manzini, and M. Shashkov. Mimetic finite difference method. J. Comput. Phys., 257-Part B:1163‚Äì1227, 2014. It allows the approximation of elliptic problems using a large class of polyhedral meshes. The proof that it enters the GDM framework is done in [Droniou et al].

In 1948 he rewrote it again as Blind Understanding (unpublished), but left that manuscript incomplete. Some of the themes in The Seafarers and Blind Understanding emerged later in Requiem for a Wren, published in 1955.

Hotel der Nederlanden was one of the three grand hotels in Batavia during the last period of the colonial rule, the other being Hotel des Indes and the Grand Hotel Java. The hotel had operated for more than a century, after which it was demolished in 1969 and was replaced with the Bina Graha presidential office. History=Private residence The hotel started as a private residence of Pieter Tenzy; the building was built in 1794. In 1799, the house was acquired by Willem Hendrik van Eijsseldijk, member of the Raad van Indie. Between 1811-1815, the house was bought by Thomas Stamford Raffles for 27,000 rupee to be used as his own private residence when he was working as a lieutenant-governor of Java between 1811 to 1816. Raffles expanded the courtyard and added several sculptures at the entrance. It was sold to the government of the Dutch Indies in 1816 when he left the country. Colonial hotel In 1837, the house was renovated into a hotel known as Hotel Palais Royale; which would start the beginning of the building as one of the grandest hotel in Batavia. The name Hotel der Nederlanden was acquired in 1846. In 1906, the dining hall of the hotel was remodeled by Indies architect Moojen. In 1922, the main building of the hotel on the Rijswijk entrance was remodeled. Post-independence In the 1950s, the hotel rating was downgraded to a \\"B\\" class hotel, as seen in the 1951 government rankings. It was ranked behind the Hotel des Indes, which was the only \\"A\\" class hotel in Jakarta at that time. In 1958, the hotel's name was nationalized into Hotel Dharma Nirmala to remove all Dutch colonial nuances while keeping the HDN initials which had been used in the glassware and crockery. Later, a restaurant wing was added to the hotel. This restaurant, known as The Ambassador, was among the few building in Jakarta that was equipped with air-conditioning unit. Later, Hotel Dharma Nirmala was converted into the headquarter of the Tjakrabirawa Regiment. In 1969, the hotel was demolished and the Bina Graha presidential office and museum was built in its place between 1969-1970.Teeuwen, D. I. Hotel der Nederlanden, now Bina Graha, in Batavia ‚Äì Jakarta during the Dutch Period The building complex Pieter Moojen. The hotel was located directly east of the Paleis van de Gouverneur Generaal (now Istana Negara). The hotel has two entrances, the tree-lined Koningsplein entrance (now Jalan Medan Merdeka Utara) and the canaled Rijswijk entrance (now Jalan Veteran) where the main building was located. During its golden age in the early 20th-century, the hotel boasted facilities such as bungalows, pavilions, stables, and coach-houses. The pavilions were freestanding buildings known for its wide verandas and a private bathroom, creating the comfort of private residences. A bungalow contains three lodge rooms. In the 1920s, all of the lodge rooms were equipped with electric lights, running water, call bells, and sanitation \\"on the most modern principles\\". The 1906-restored dining hall forms the main part of the main building. Designed by Indies architect Moojen (architect of the Kunstkring Art Gallery and Cirebon railway station), the grand dining hall was capable of seating two hundred people.

It was developed in 1924 by Dwight P. Robinson & Company. The building at 655 Park Avenue was designed by architects James Edwin Ruthven Carpenter, Jr., often referred to by the initials \\"J.E.R. Carpenter\\", and Mott B. Schmidt. Carpenter is considered the leading architect for luxury residential high-rise buildings in New York City in the early 1900s, while Schmidt is known for his buildings in the American Georgian Classical style, including Sutton Place and houses for New York City's society figures and business elite. Building 655 Park Avenue is designed in the Georgian architectural style, with a limestone base on the lower floors, and brick masonry on the upper floors. The building is centered around a courtyard garden facing Park Avenue. The building's staggered height design, perhaps unique among Park Avenue co-ops of its era, was a result of restrictions placed on the developer by a syndicate of owners of nearby mansions who sold the land on which 655 Park Avenue was built.

Berg's work is included in the permanent collection of the Guggenheim Museum in New York, as well as the National Museum of American Jewish History, and Coca-Cola. Early life Berg was born Siri Schlossman in September 1921 in Stockholm, Sweden, the daughter of Henia (Gassler) and Arthur Schlossman, who both worked in business. Her father was from Germany and her mother from Poland. She earned her bachelor's degree in art and architecture in Brussels. At age 19 in 1940, she traveled to New York City on her own. The trip took 28 days on a freighter with eight passengers. Her aunt met her in New York Cit] at Columbus Circle, and her parents made the voyage six months later. Career In New York, she worked in fashion and store window design for Franklin Simon & Co. as well as private clients before transitioning to focus on art in the early 1970s. Berg lived in Riverdale when she started painting in 1961. She created the series \\"Cycle of Life\\" in 1967 tracing the life cycle from the embryo through youth, maturity, and old age. In 1979, she gave a lecture at Brandeis University National Women's Committee Riverdale Chapter's annual Study Group party which focused on the 10 year development of her art. She transitioned from a studio in her home in Riverdale to a studio in the Soho Arts district in 1981. Berg taught color theory at Parsons School of Design for over 25 years. Berg was a member of the American Abstract Artists group (AAA). Exhibitions Her first solo exhibition was in 1970 at the East Hampton Gallery in New York City. That exhibition featured work based on Arthur Schnitzler's Reigen or La Ronde which became a permanent installation at Union Dime Savings Bank. Berg presented \\"The Black Series and The Four Elements - Selections\\" in 1979 at the New School Associates Gallery in New York. It was her seventh solo show of paintings in New York City. Berg was part of a three-person show, \\"Unknown Universes\\", at Pace University in 1979. Her work was exhibited at the American Swedish Historical Museum in Philadelphia in 1980. In 1980, the exhibition \\"Siri Berg: Aspects of the Circle; Paintings of the Seventies\\" was presented at Ward-Nasse Gallery in Soho, New York. The exhibit presented a ten-year survey of the artists' work to that point, including works from her \\"La Ronde Series\\", \\"Phases Series\\", \\"Black Series\\", \\"White Series\\", \\"White Series\\" and the \\"Four Elements Series\\". In 1984, Berg's exhibit \\"The Geometric Angle in Sculpture\\" was presented at Martin/Molinary Art and Design. The exhibit featured her transition into working with found objects. The exhibition also featured painting Berg created in the 70s including her \\"Black Series\\" and \\"Four Elements\\" which would later be included in the Guggenheim Museum's permanent collection. The exhibition debuted Berg's \\"White Holes\\" and \\"Black Holes\\" which use painted and unpainted suction cups in various ways mounted on Masonite and displayed in clear Plexiglas boxes Berg called \\"Environmental Boxes\\". \\"The Big Bang\\" was also included in the exhibit which portrayed a mushroom cloud as a thick white circle made of painted flexible pipe. Berg held an exhibit at QCC Art Gallery at the Queensborough Community College in 1990. The exhibit included two series of black and white works, \\"The Four Elements\\" and \\"Empty Spaces\\". In 1994, she participated in a group of 35 artists who illustrated the biblical poem \\"Aishet Hayil: Woman of Valor\\" from the Book of Proverbs. The collection was exhibited at Yeshiva University Museum in New York. At that time, Berg began working with Stockholm's Galerie Konstruktiv Tendens. In 2011, Berg debuted her series It's All About Color at The Painting Center in New York. In 2012, her work was presented by Hionas Gallery in the exhibit \\"Black and White 1976 - 1981: Redux 2012\\" held in New York, New York which highlighted her early black and white works as opposed to her typical use of bold color. In the same year, Berg's work was featured in the group show \\"American Abstract Artists International\\" held at the Museum of the Aragonese Castle in Otranto, Italy. Her exhibit presented by Hionas Gallery in 2013 was titled \\"Phases\\". In 2015, Berg's exhibit \\"Siri Berg: Color and Space\\" opened at Hionas Gallery. Technique Berg's work consists of assemblages (art created from found objects), paintings and collages. Her works tend to be minimalist through the use of geometric abstraction or color. Her main influence is the Bauhaus due to their \\"revolutionary and unconventional approach\\". Her art has been described as \\"cerebral and calculated\\" and \\"a paradox - exuberance born of control\\". Personal life She married twice and had two sons, Jeffrey and Arthur. Berg died in April 2020 at the age of 98.

History Tradition holds that this at this site, near a church dedicated to San Nicola di Bari, was the spot where St Francis gathered with some fellow monks in the year 1222-1223. This gathering would become the nucleus of the founding of the monastery at the site. The church, while called San Francesco, is actually dedicated to St Nicholas, represented in the painting above the altar. Papal documents from the first half of the thirteenth century assert the assignment of the property to the Franciscan order. After a short transfer to Monte \\"Grugliano\\" (or Coriolanus), the Conventual Franciscans returned to St Nicholas to the 1298. The present church was built from 1766 to 1778. The design of the tall bell tower is attributed to the architect Pietro Augustoni. An inventory, compiled in 1729 (now in the Archives of Fermo diocese), takes note that the church had two naves and six altars, including the main altar. Among the paintings in the church was an polyptych altarpiece (1493), now dispersed, by Vittore Crivelli. Also lost since that inventory are also the frescoes for the chapel of Santa Venera of the Albanians (1491) painted by Ludovico Urbani. But 15th-century frescoes remain in the wall of the stairs leading to the choir parts of frescoes, supposedly depicting a \\"Visitation.\\" The lateral altars have paintings depicting the \\"Miracle of St Joseph of Cupertino\\", a \\"Nativity\\" and the \\"Transit of Sant'Andrea Avellino\\". The two painted canvases, to the sides of the main altar-piece, depict the Papal approval of the Franciscan rule.

It takes place in Kolkata, India, where Das grew up, and is considered South Asian speculative fiction and dark fantasy, incorporating aspects of historical fiction, fantasy, and horror. It was originally published by Penguin India in 2015, followed by release in North America by Ballantine Del Rey of Penguin Random House in July 2016. The novel features Shape-shifters, more specifically werewolves, and explores the concepts of love, cannibalism, and what it means to be human. It is told in a multi-layered manner, alternating between different time periods and perspectives. The author's writing has been compared to that of Neil Gaiman, Margaret Atwood, China Mi√©ville, and David Mitchell.  Plot  The story, which takes place primarily in Kolkata, is set during the reign of the Mughal Empire in the seventeenth century and extends to modern India. The main character, Alok Mukherjee, is a college professor and historian who happens upon a stranger that tells him a story about shape-shifters that devour human souls in order to survive. The stranger claims that the tale he tells it true, and although Alok is skeptical, he is intrigued and insists on finishing the story. Alok is then enlisted to translate and transcribe a collection of notebooks and texts documented on human skin, through which the rest of the story is told.  Reception  The Devourers was shortlisted for the 2015 Shakti Bhatt First Book Prize, the 2015 TATA Live!

Due to the families‚Äô and her home- towns close connection to Martin Heidegger, she devoted much of her youth to art and philosophy, later ventured into Zen Buddhism and Advaita Vedanta. She studied Sinology and Sanskrit, Old Oriental Studies at Freie Universit√§t BerlinArnd Weseman, Deutschland, 17. Februar S.41 Screen Multimedia, ‚ÄúDatenfaden im Seidenkleid‚Äù, Arnd Weseman, Deutschland, February 1996, pp. 131-133 until she got accepted at the costume design department and later at the Visual Arts Department at Universit√§t der K√ºnste Berlin. Here she did her Masters with Katharina Sieverding. As a tutor she taught photography and printing and organized many artist talks between 1990 and 1992, among others with John Cage, Joan Jonas, Marina Abramoviƒá, Alfredo Jaar, Antoni Muntadas,Joseph Kosuth, Dara Birnbaum, Christina Kubisch, Hans Haacke, Guerilla Girls, Stephen Willats and Nan Goldin. She was a founding member of the student organization Interflugs, which represented the students interests to the administration and to professors, and gave access to at the time advanced technological equipment, such as computers, video projectors, editing equipment and video cameras. Together with her fellow students, she advocated equal rights and demanded a higher share of women as female professors Tip, ‚ÄúFrauen ohne Grenzen‚Äù, Hanna Lenz, Berlin, Deutschland, September 1992 at the still predominantly male college of arts. Consequently, she was very active in the student strike. In addition to a number of subtle performances and photographic works dealing with political themes, such as golf war, AIDS,Get Better Soon, Frank Wagner, Aids Project, NGBK (New Society for Fine Arts), Berlin, 1993 she held her studio first in a squat and later above a homeless asylum in Berlin. She supported various forms of demonstrations in public space for equality, integration of foreigners and acceptance of homosexuals and collected funds for various social purposes. (ShoeshineWoman, Condom and Toy- vending machines in Clubs, See you do not look, The Artist Is Present).Erst Mal was auf‚Äôs Maul, Katalog, Deutschland, Hochschule der K√ºnste, Berlin, Deutschland, pp. 4, 1992 \\"The Artist Is Present\\" was seen in the political-social sense as presence and response-ability of the artist. For more than a decade she was accompanied by Fernando Pessoa‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Book of Disquiet‚Äù, introducing him as her soulmate, many times reserving a space next to her for him.Observador: Rita Cipriano on Regina Frank: ‚ÄúSer artista √© ter um lado pol√≠tico‚Äù (To be an artist is in itself political) 18 December 2016 Together with a group of friends she was crashing opening parties in painters protection suits and masks made from photocopies of self-portraits of famous painters such as Max Ernst, Pablo Picasso, Vincent van Gogh demonstrating for artists rights.Avant Art Magazine: Interview Regina Frank (part one): The Artist is Present Within All of Us, June 2013 She lived various times as Frank going out with a mustache and side-burns. She actively danced Tango from 1986 onwards and did many public performances with one female or one male partner, on a private occasion she danced with/for Astor Piazzolla, while he was improvising on his Bandoneon. Most times when asked for her contact she gave her card which was deprived of all information except ‚ÄúThe Artist is Present‚Äù or Regina Frank ‚ÄúThe Artist is Present‚Äù in the early 90s. As this was long before search engines the card was useless to get in touch with her. Though her whole appearance delivered material for performances, it was not until she personally met John Cage in 1990 and organized a workshop for him at the University of Art that she discovered the power and potential of performance to integrate in her own artwork. She played chess with him and documented the game as a ‚Äúphotographic artpiece‚Äù. Shortly after she organized another workshop for Marina Abramoviƒá and later an exhibition with her classmates during Marina‚Äôs guest professorship at the University of Art, Berlin. Consequently, she was invited to participate in many museum exhibitions with her performance installations, which kept her collages, drawings and paintings largely unknown. Career L‚ÄôAdieu Pearls before Gods (1993) dealt with human rights issues and global labor division. With a 28-day performance in the window of the New Museum of Contemporary Art she drew attention to the global underpayment in the textile industry. While she embroidered pearls on a white silk dress, she received a different hourly wage every day, calculated by the average wage of 28 different countries, paid by Westminster Bank. On her first day she earned $17.10 an hour for Norway , decreasing to 20 cents (the average cost for a worker in Indonesia in 1992 according to apparel data. Her decreasing wages were published in the Dow Jones stock index. She bought flowers and bread, symbolically as food for body and soul, and to reveal the purchasing power of her wages. The installation, which was produced during this performance, was sold to Robert J. Shiffler's collection through auction at Christies. A part of the proceeds went to a foundation that worked for the rights of illegally entrenched textile workers, who were held, like slaves, in small factories in New York 's sweatshops around the corner of the museum. The work was extensively discussed. In addition to some TV portraits, articles in Parade Magazine, Harper‚Äôs Bazaar, Cosmopolitan and Vogue appeared. Regina Frank \\"The Artist is Present\\" travelled as Hermes Mistress to Europe, USA and Asia from 1994-2001. Spiral Wacoal Art Center Tokyo Hermes' Mistress\\" From 1993 onwards, she dealt with the Internet as a steadily growing source of information. \\"Hermes' Mistress\\" investigated the meaning of this flood of information, by sitting 777 hours in different museums, ‚Äúharvesting‚Äù information that touched her from the Internet and spelling it out stitching letter for letter on an island-like red dress. (26,226 letter beads). Hermes Mistress was shown first at Exit Art, New York, and after travelled to Kunsthalle, Berlin / Museum of Contemporary Art (MOCA), Los Angeles / Bronx Museum of the Arts, New York / Spiral Wacoal Art Center Tokyo, Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sof√≠a, Madrid / Kampnagel, Hamburg / UNESCO, Paris / Fondapol, Paris / Shih Chien University (Taiwan). In the GlassBeadGame, 1996(named after Hermann Hesse's novel), during the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, she dealt with art as a source of international exchange and a contribution to peace. (See MIT-Press \\"Conversations at the Castle\\"). For this interactive performance installation, she wove a \\"magic mantle\\" (kimono) from favorite books and quotes. Visitors were able to contribute to the installation via the Internet: with virtual pearls from texts and poems, generated by a computer program. Frank in her own video: ‚ÄúThere was a space where there was no winner and no loser, an Olympic game for everyone - a possibility to be present, regardless of space and time.‚Äù With the Glass Bead Game, Frank succeeded in gaining acceptance in the Japanese market, which later extended to Taiwan and China. She worked with Pixelpark creating software and later with Media Service Group, with whom she worked as well on Inner Networks in 2000, creating a large calendar and a series of prints. Between 1995 and 1999 Regina Frank worked with the Internet and developed works like A-dress. Similar to the later ‚Äúblogging‚Äù, she wrote a letter to her own dress every day for 97 days, acting as an address. The letter was available daily on a website, but at the exhibition at the Winnipeg Art Gallery in Canada, the texts were printed on white sheets, and filled the inside of her dress, linked to withered and ink-dyed leaves on the outer surface. The work was used as a cover for the book \\"Negotiating Domesticity\\" by Hilde Heynen and G√ºlsum Baydar, published by Routledge. In 1999, she developed a Mushroom Dress for the Philippseich Castle Park literally growing a dress from mushrooms which she consumed with visitors. During the Expo 2000 in Hanover, she sat under the title Performance&Performance; in the shop window of the International Women's University pavilion and was literally linked to the stock market by a real-time connection. For seven hours, she sat still and with very slow movements she reflected the rising and falling of stocks, thematizing the manipulative involvement of the stock-market with human everyday life. In 2001 for the Intermediale Mainz she created Food for Soul feeding people with quotes and fresh fruit and vegetables in a white enormous dress celebrating abundance. In 2002 What is Black? What is White? She built a camera into an ink brush, thus showing the process of writing of the answers from above and from the perspective of the camera, and eliminating the perspective of the artist. In the white installation space the form of the dress gradually became visible as the black text spiraled outward. In 2003 Whiteness in DecayUnion-Tribune ‚ÄûReaching into past for inspiration‚Äú, Robert L. Pincus, San Diego, USA, 29.05 at the San Diego Museum of Art, she asked: What feeds your soul? More than 3000 responses were projected on a canvas behind her plaster cast. She was covered in plaster for this performance and slowly freed herself from the hard white shell, peeling the fruits and vegetables from her crust and share them with the audience. A process from a white fragile doll into a colorful human painting and being. She taught masterclasses for Bauhaus Dessau in 2003, directed a group performance at Bauhaus Dessau with young performers and curated an exhibition in 2004 in an abandoned shopping center right next to Bauhaus. In 2004 she started Sharing Silence Museum of Modern Art, ‚ÄúAIR - Stepping across Borders‚Äù, Sapporo, Japan with the Museum of Modern Art and SAIR residency in Sapporo which she continued in Taiwan, Germany, France, UK and Portugal until 2011 for seven years, spending 7 minutes to 7 hours in silence with complete strangers. From 2005-2007 she developed Dreamweaving Dreamweaving, Regina Frank, 14 Pages Calendar, Including Software CD-ROM, Druckvogt Germany a game for children and adults encoding text into images, turning poetry into pictures and again text into textile. The game was available in English, German and Portuguese, due to a grant by the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation. In 2005 she worked on the social software and performance project Constellations for FEA (Federal Environmental Agency, Germany) where she photographed more than 400 employees and up to three chosen items per person, connecting and introducing them to each other. Late 2007 Regina Frank, as she turned 6x7 years old, she committed to go on a seven-year sabbatical from established art institutions.Video lecture for PRAXIS Center for Aesthetic Studies Brainard Carey She and continued working on Sharing Silence as an ongoing performance and developed several unpublished performances investigating the ready made of Marcel Duchamp within. It was supposed to lead into the culminating phase of ‚ÄúThe Artist is Present,‚Äù a 28-year project, conceived in 1989, but when Marina Abramoviƒá used her title at MOMA, she realized that the artist could be confused with the body mind organism and changed. \\"The HeArt is Present\\" was dropping the ‚Äúist‚Äù of the Artist in favor of a greater self and a less personal identity and a reminder for the inspiring entity within all of us. It is also during this time that she returns to her painting and drawing, culminating in an exhibition at her home town at Me√ükirch Castle entitled ‚ÄúThe Art is Present‚Äù in 2017 after her Seven-Year-Sabbatical. iLAND 2011-2018, is a series of performances in public space, (streets, beaches, landings etc.), dealing with environmental issues. iLAND shows the imbalanced zones of our planet in a textile collage together with intact landscapes, which have not yet been haunted by disasters in the last 500 years. Aerial photographs and topographical images were changed, painted, printed and combined in photomontages. The dress and the sculpture became an island of discussion, a vehicle for communication and a field for common reflections. In her performance, she moves so slowly that the movement can only be perceived in time-lapse, almost like the growth of a plant, as we see the effect of our actions often only after when we fast forward. Regina Frank's work is inspired by Sufism (Rumi), Zen meditation, and Advaita Vedanta. Poets such as Fernando Pessoa and various Philosophers such as Ludwig Wittgenstein, Martin Heidegger. Samuel Beckett could be seen as an important influence, as well as Johannes Vermeer, Henri Michaux, Joseph Beuys, as well as the German Fluxus movement.

Early life and work Jaye was born in Fort Sill, Oklahoma, United States, to Nena Jaye. At age eighteen, she moved to Los Angeles, where she was an actress for five years before moving to Marin County, California in 2008. Jaye disliked the stereotypical roles she was cast in, which she described as \\"cute girl-next-door who always died in horror films.\\" Along with several incidents of sexual harassment, this led her to embrace feminism. Documentary career After leaving the acting field, Jaye stayed in films, but as a documentary producer, director, and editor. She formed Jaye Bird Productions, a film production company, in 2008. Her mother is her production partner. Daddy I Do Jaye directed and produced the 2010 American documentary film Daddy I Do which examines sex education and sexual abstinence programs in America. Daddy I Do included interviews with the founder of the Silver Ring Thing Denny Pattyn, feminist writer Amanda Marcotte, and Douglas Kirby. The film also discusses personal stories from women facing teenage pregnancy, single motherhood, abortion and sexual assault. Bust magazine praised \\"Jaye for exposing the truth about abstinence-only programs, the stories of teenagers who buy into it, and its consequences...\\" The Right to Love: An American Family Jaye directed and produced her second feature documentary film The Right to Love: An American Family in 2012. The film chronicles a family known as \\"Gay Family Values\\" on YouTube in the aftermath of California Proposition 8 (2008). The film premiered in February 2012 at the Castro Theatre in San Francisco, California with guest speaker Zach Wahls. The film went on to screen at the Frameline Film Festival. The Red Pill Jaye directed and produced the 2016 American documentary film The Red Pill about the men's rights movement. Jaye spent a year interviewing men's rights figures, such as Paul Elam, founder of A Voice for Men; Harry Crouch, president of the National Coalition for Men; Warren Farrell, author of The Myth of Male Power; and Erin Pizzey, who started the first domestic violence shelter in the modern world. She also interviewed critics of the movement, such as Ms. magazine executive editor Katherine Spillar, and sociologist Michael Kimmel. Jaye initially relied on her own money to fund the film, as well that from her mother and her boyfriend, as she found difficulty finding backers from traditional sources after it became known that the film would take a \\"balanced approach\\" view of the men's rights movement. In what she called a \\"last resort\\", she started a campaign on the crowdfunding platform Kickstarter. The Kickstarter project promised to be a fair and balanced look at the men's rights movement. Her effort was strongly criticized by some feminists including David Futrelle, who runs a website called We Hunted the Mammoth and who said it looked like propaganda. She received support from Breitbart News columnist Milo Yiannopoulos. Futrelle also accused Jaye of soliciting funding from members of the men's rights movement, which she portrays sympathetically. She has said that the suggestion the film was funded by MRAs (men's rights activists) is \\"a common lie that keeps spreading,\\" and that the film's backers and producers would have no influence or control of the film. It has also been criticized by Alan Scherstuhl of The Village Voice, among others, for failing to challenge controversial comments and behavior from men's rights figures such as Elam. Jaye has defended the film as being \\"extremely balanced\\" and that people were \\"heard in context without manipulation\\". The film has had screenings canceled in Australia following petitions, protests, and threats against those holding the screening. In a 2017 interview with Australian TV show The Project, when asked about a recent high-profile murder of Luke Anderson by his father, Jaye emphasized that it was a specific example of a male victim of domestic abuse, instead of as an example of a male perpetrator. Jaye described the interview as \\"hostile and aggressive\\", and initially pulled out of some interviews following the incident. Later she resumed interviews but made her own recording of the discussions, as she stated she had been \\"misquoted so much\\". In an interview on the Australian TV show Weekend Sunrise, Jaye asked the show's hosts directly \\"Did you see the film?\\". The co-hosts said they had not. After receiving a wave of comments critical of the hosts and supporting Jaye, Sunrise removed the video of the interview from their Facebook page. Jaye uploaded the interview to her own page, where it was removed shortly after as a copyright violation. When asked about the removal from Facebook a spokeswoman for the Seven network which produces Sunrise declined to comment. Jaye also posted screenshots of emails to prove that Sunrise's producer had received a copy of the film a month before the interview and plenty of time for the hosts to have watched it. This was to disprove the hosts' claim that they did not receive a copy of the film. At the end of the film, Jaye states that she no longer identifies as a feminist, saying that she now believes that \\"feminism is not the road to gender equality\\". Although she no longer calls herself a feminist, she has stated that she is \\"still an advocate of women's rights and always will be\\" but is now \\"adding men to the discussion.\\" Jaye gave a TEDx speech about her experience making The Red Pill. It focused particularly on how the process initially affirmed her feminist sense of otherism and outrage against the men's rights movement, but then later broke it down. It was an \\"uncomfortable and humbling experience\\", and one that turned her \\"from feminism to gender equality activism\\".

Now living in San Francisco, California, she is originally from West Tennessee, and started the website due to her experiences as a congressional staffer, with the goal of making the government more accessible to the average voter. The website began at the federal level and has plans to move to the state level in 2017. Harris and her initiatives are at the forefront of the civic technology movement, which aims to use technology in order to facilitate public participation in politics to pave the way for better government infrastructure.  Early life  Harris was born in Tennessee, and attended the Lausanne Collegiate School, also known as the Lausanne Collegiate School for Girls, which is an independent, nonsectarian school for children in kindergarten through twelfth grade in Memphis. She comes from a long line of entrepreneurs, with her grandma taking over the local funeral parlor the family ran after her grandfather passed away, a radical move at the time. Her father started a real estate company, and Marci grew up with business being a dominant family conversation. Politics was also a highly contested issue in Harris's family with her father being a strong Republican and her mother being Democratic. Harris traveled much during her childhood and teen years. Marci was a sophomore in high school when she moved to Australia for six months in 1991, returning to Memphis to finish her senior year of high school. She then traveled to Paraguay before deciding to go to the Franklin School in Switzerland for College between 1993 and 1997.  Career = 2007‚Äì2010: Congress  After receiving a law degree at the University of Memphis and then a master of law at The American University in 2007, Harris went on to work in Congress as a congressional staffer for three years, focusing on issues of health care reform, medicare, waste fraud, and abuse. She first entered the congressional arena when she became the Tax, Trade, and Health Counsel to Pete Stark, and oversaw the Ways and Means Health Subcommittee in the areas of Medicare program integrity and transparency issues. In her time at Congress, Harris was under President Barack Obama; notable congressional events under his presidency included the \\"Obamacare\\" implementation of health care, one of the most distinguishing characteristics of Obama's administration. For Harris, such events defined and shaped her experience in these arenas, signifying the need for citizen participation in their implementation.  2010‚Äìpresent: Popvox  It was during her time working for Stark that Harris got her idea for Popvox, noticing that Congress oftentimes received much input from the public, but oftentimes failed to organize it efficiently enough to employ it constructively. After leaving the hill in 2010, Marci went on to co-found PopVox with UCLA alum Radha Chaudhry as well as the help of other civic tech enthusiasts. The website contains a plethora of public information about bills that's are introduced in Congress. Advocacy organizations can register for a profile on the website and include their positions on certain bills, stating whether they support them or oppose them. The website gained rapid traction, going on to win the SxSW BizSpark Accelerator startup competition in 2011 and was named one of the Top Open Government Websites by Read Write Web. In addition to running PopVox, Marci currently serves on the board of LaunchTN, which is a public-private partnership aimed at fostering entrepreneurship among high-growth companies in her home town of Tennessee. Additionally, she mentors at Code for America Accelerator in San Francisco, California. For her main project, PopVox, Harris has goals of testing out a pilot platform at state levels for the website to integrate from federal to state level. She plans on traveling throughout the country to speak about the PopVox and its goals, and her next stops are Knoxville, Chattanooga, Nashville, and Jackson, finally ending her tour in Memphis.  Harris's views on civic-technology  In a 2014 interview with TechPresident reporter Sonia Roubini, Harris described her views on civic technology's role in future political participation, stating, \\"transparency, government technology, and civic engagement are different and complementary things that require different approaches and different expertise\\". Harris's statement reveals her belief in the distinction between technology and government as two sides of the same coin, noting instead that technology is a tool and asset that should be used to further open government. She used her own platform as an example of this idea, and said, \\"The true power of Popvox is not its technology, however. It is in the voices of people sharing their personal stories with their elected representatives.\\" In a six-minute 2012 Ted Talk video in which she spoke, Harris conveyed her belief that through technology, people can gain more power than powerful lobbyists, armed with financial power.  Personal life  Harris currently resides in San Francisco, California, where her main priority is carrying out her duties as CEO of Popvox. She has employed the help of her brother, who serves as COO of the website.

Background In India, gratuity is a type of retirement benefit. It is a payment made with the intent of monetarily helping an employee after his or her retirement. It was held by the Supreme Court of India in Indian Hume Pipe Co Ltd v Its Workmen that the general principle underlying a gratuity scheme is that by service over a long period the employee is entitled to claim a certain amount as retirement benefit. The Payment of Gratuity Act was passed by the Parliament of India on 21 August 1972 and it came in force from 16 September 1972! Application and extent The act applies to the whole of India. Including the two new Union territories earlier this law was not applicable for Jammu and Kashmir. The act applies to all factories, mines, oilfields, plantations, ports and railway companies. But in the case of shops or establishments, other than those stated before, it applies to those organisations with 10 or more persons are employed on any day of the preceding 12 months. Under Section 1(3-A), if in case of any shop and establishment to which the act applies, the number of employee reduces below 10, it shall continue to be governed by the act irrespective of the number of employees. Thus, no employer will be able to refuse gratuity under this act by reducing the number of employees. Under Section 2(e), nothing in this act applies to apprentices and persons who hold civil posts under the Central Government or State Governments and are subjected to any other act or rule other than this act. Payment of gratuity: Eligibility and calculation Under Section 4, payment of gratuity is mandatory. Gratuity shall be payable to an employee on termination of employment after he has rendered continuous service for not less than 5 years in a single organisation. The termination can be due to: Superannuation, Retirement or resignation, and Death or disablement due to accident or disease. As per Section 4(1), the completion of continuous service of 5 years is not required where termination of employment is due to death or disablement. In such case mandatory gratuity is payable. Gratuity is paid at a rate of 15 days' wages for every completed year of service or part thereof in excess of six months. The wages here means wages last drawn by the employee. The \\"15 days' wages\\" will be calculated by dividing the last drawn wages by 26 and multiplying the result with 15. But under Section 4(3), the maximum gratuity that is payable is fixed at ‚Çπ20,00,000. Any gratuity amount paid in excess of ‚Çπ20,00,000 is taxable in the employee's hands.

Transferred to the Royal Canadian Navy in 1942, the vessel served on both coasts of Canada and took part in the Battle of the Atlantic as a convoy escort and the invasion of Normandy. Following the war, the minesweeper was returned to the United Kingdom who then sold the ship to the Portuguese Navy in 1946. Renamed Almirante Lacerda, the vessel was used as a survey ship until 1975 when it was discarded. Design and description A British design, the Bangor-class minesweepers were smaller than the preceding s in British service, but larger than the in Canadian service.Chesneau, p. 64Macpherson and Barrie (2002), p. 177 They came in two versions powered by different engines; those with a diesel engines and those with vertical triple-expansion steam engines. Caraquet was of the latter design and was larger than her diesel-engined cousins. Caraquet was long overall, had a beam of and a draught of . The minesweeper had a displacement of . She had a complement of 6 officers and 77 enlisted. Caraquet had two vertical triple-expansion steam engines, each driving one shaft, using steam provided by two Admiralty three-drum boilers. The engines produced a total of and gave a maximum speed of . The minesweeper could carry a maximum of of fuel oil. British Bangor-class minesweepers were armed with a single 12-pounder () 12 cwt HA gun mounted forward. For anti-aircraft purposes, the minesweepers were equipped with one QF 2-pounder Mark VIII and two single-mounted QF 20 mm Oerlikon guns.Macpherson (1997), p. 38 The 2-pounder gun was later replaced with a twin 20 mm Oerlikon mount. As a convoy escort, Caraquet was deployed with 40 depth charges launched from two depth charge throwers and four chutes. Operational history The minesweeper was ordered as part of the British 1940 construction programme. The ship's keel was laid down on 31 January 1941 by North Vancouver Ship Repairs at their yard in North Vancouver, British Columbia. Named for a bay in New Brunswick, Caraquet was launched on 2 June 1941. Transferred to the Royal Canadian Navy, the ship was commissioned on 2 April 1942 at Vancouver.Macpherson and Barrie (2002), p. 178 Following work ups, the minesweeper joined Esquimalt Force in May 1942, the local patrol and convoy escort force operating out of Esquimalt, British Columbia. Caraquet was one of the warships added to the west coast patrol force after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. The main duty of Bangor-class minesweepers after commissioning on the West Coast was to perform the Western Patrol. This consisted of patrolling the west coast of Vancouver Island, inspecting inlets and sounds and past the Scott Islands to Gordon Channel at the entrance to the Queen Charlotte Strait and back.Douglas et al., No Higher Purpose, pp. 349, 352 In September, the minesweeper was transferred to Prince Rupert Force, the patrol and escort unit operating out of Prince Rupert, British Columbia and remained with the group until March 1943, when Caraquet was ordered to the Atlantic Coast of Canada. The minesweeper arrived at Halifax, Nova Scotia on 2 May 1943 and was assigned to the Western Local Escort Force as a convoy escort. Caraquet switched to Halifax Force, the local patrol and escort unit operating from Halifax in June. Beginning in July, the minesweeper began a six-week refit at Baltimore, Maryland in the United States. In December, the vessel transferred again, this time to Newfoundland Force, the escort group operating from St. John's, Newfoundland. Caraquet worked with Newfoundland Force until February 1944, when the minesweeper was ordered to Europe as part of Canada's contribution to the invasion of Normandy. After arriving at Plymouth on 13 March, the minesweeper was assigned to the all-Canadian 31st Minesweeping Flotilla as Senior Officer's Ship.Douglas et al., A Blue Water Navy, p. 233 During the invasion, Caraquet and her fellow minesweepers swept and marked channels through the German minefields leading into the invasion beaches in the American sector.Schull, pp. 233‚Äì234 The 31st Minesweeping Flotilla swept channel 3 on 6 June, completing the task unmolested by the Germans.Schull, pp. 270‚Äì273 The minesweeper remained in European waters until returning to Canada in September to undergo a refit at Lunenburg, Nova Scotia. The minesweeper returned to Plymouth in March 1945 and rejoined the 31st Minesweeping Flotilla. Caraquet took part in the last large-scale combined operation in the European theatre in an attack on German naval bases in France that had been left untouched by Allied war effort to that point. Departing Plymouth on 12 April 1945, the 31st Minesweeping Flotilla began operations in the mouth of the Gironde estuary on 14 April. They completed their duties on 16 April, unmolested by the Germans. While returning to Plymouth, the flotilla encountered a German trawler and captured it.Schull, pp. 395‚Äì396 Canso and the 31st Minesweeping Flotilla spent the next five months sweeping the English Channel.Douglas et al., A Blue Water Navy, p. 337 Caraquet was paid off and returned to the Royal Navy on 26 September 1945 at Sheerness. Never entering service with the Royal Navy, the vessel was sold to the Portuguese Navy on 29 June 1946 and renamed Almirante Lacerda. Used primarily as a survey vessel, Almirante Lacerda remained in service until 1975.Colledge, p. 123 The fate of the vessel is disputed among the sources. Colledge states the vessel was transferred to Mozambique in 1975 and the ship's registry deleted in 1984. The Miramar Ship Index claims the vessel was broken up in 1975.

Her novels treat of the experience of being an outsider, of growing up poor in rural France, and of the silence that accompanies the inability to communicate. She was also a French literature teacher at the Lyc√©e Carnot in Paris.  Family  In√®s Cagnati was born in Monclar-d'Ag√©nais, Lot-et-Garonne. Her parents were Italian agricultural workers, both from Northern Italy‚Äîher father from Treviso, and her mother from Vicenza‚Äîwho, like more than eighty-thousand Italian workers and farmhands did in the 1930s, moved to the southwestern Lot-et-Garonne and Aquitaine regions in France for the prospect of a richer life. \\"Illiterate for the most part and unable to speak French,\\" writes Liesl Schillinger, \\"many of these economic refugees found work on marshy, rocky farmland that had been abandoned by Frenchmen who had fallen in the Great War or who had moved to the city.\\" This is the landscape that Cagnati describes in her first book, Le Jour de Cong√©: \\"In the bleached-out soil at our place, the only thing that grows is stones. Others harvest their crops, we gather our stones. [...] Everything dies in our blanched land.\\" Cagnati had four sisters: Elsa, Gilda, Annie and Anabel, to whom she dedicated her first book, Le Jour de Cong√© (1973). Given the common occurrence of miscarriages at the time that happened at the time, and the amount of miscarriages that Galla, the protagonist of Cagnati's first novel Le Jour de Cong√©, witnesses, it's possible that Cagnati and her sisters had other siblings that died unborn, or in infancy.  Life and Writing  Cagnati's mother tongue was Italian. She was taught French when she started attending grade school. She did not consider herself French, and was naturalized into citizenship after birth. She describes the experience gaining citizenship as a tragedy. \\"Because clearly I wasn't French,\\" she said, in a rare televised interview in 1989. \\"And then I wasn't Italian anymore, either. So I was nothing.\\" She considered herself to be an √©trang√®re, an outsider, all her life. Cagnati described her childhood as unhappy. In that same 1989 interview, the journalist asks her if her unhappiness as a child was due to her isolation, her sense of separation from those around her, and the impossibility of communicating. She shrugs: \\"Maybe I just had a bad experience. I don't know. [As a child] you're all alone, you can't understand a thing. People expect all these things from you that you don't understand‚Äîespecially when you don't speak the language.\\" This was especially true of Cagnati's experience in school, when she was learning French. She attributed her exclusion from the other children to her foreignness and inability to learn the language, as well as an immediately noticed and acutely felt class difference with the other students. ‚ÄúI understood nothing anyone told me,\\" Cagnati said in a 1984 interview in the regional paper Sud-Ouest Dimanche, as related by translator Liesl Schillinger. \\"I couldn't even obey, I didn't know what they wanted. [...] [The schoolchildren's] world was hostile, aggressive, they didn't want us there. I didn't understand their language or their rules, or what I was supposed to do in order to be tolerated, or at least to be pardoned for being myself, different,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI think it was the same for the others.‚Äù She added, ‚ÄúI think we were rejected more because we were poor than because we were Italian.‚Äù > \\"A l‚Äô√©cole, le monde a bascul√©. Je ne comprenais rien √† ce que l‚Äôon me > disait, je ne pouvais m√™me pas ob√©ir, je ne savais pas ce qu‚Äôon me voulait. > Les Fran√ßais n‚Äôavaient plus rien de fascinant. Leur monde √©tait hostile, > agressif, il ne nous voulaient pas ; je ne comprenais ni son langage ni ses > lois et ni ce que je devais faire non pour √™tre tol√©r√©e, mais au moins pour > √™tre pardonn√©e d‚Äô√™tre moi, diff√©rente...\\" \\"...Les autres enfants > manifestaient aussi leur aversion, par la d√©rision, les injures, les > poursuites.

Fran√ßaises contre > √©trang√®res, aussi enrag√©es les unes que les autres, et toutes maniant > glorieusement les insultes dont nous disposions.\\" Cagnati attended high school and continued her post-secondary studies in literature. She obtained a license (Bachelor's degree) and passed the CAPES exam to become a high school teacher. She began teaching at the Lyc√©e Carnot, a prestigious high-school in Paris, in 1970, worked on her manuscripts while employed there, and published her first novel, Le Jour de Cong√©, in 1973, when she was 36 years old. She published her second novel just three years later. It appears that she lived in Bras√≠lia for a short time, according to an article by Le Monde when she won the Prix des Deux Magots for her second novel, G√©nie la folle, in 1977, and that she was married, briefly, to an engineer. Dr. Joanna Scutts writes. \\"Two years later, when her third book was published, Cagnati was back in France, photographed for Paris Match in her country home, playing, reading, and roasting chestnuts with her young son; her husband is present in one picture, leaning out of their tight circle. In the 1989 interview, Cagnati does not mention him, describing her son as her only true family.\\"  Works  * Le Jour de cong√©, 1973 ‚Äì Prix Roger-Nimier, translated in English as Free Day, by Liesl Schillinger (NYRB Classics, 2019). * G√©nie la folle, 1976 ‚Äì Prix des Deux Magots. * Mos√© ou le L√©zard qui pleurait, 1979. * Les Pipistrelles, 1989 ‚Äì Prix de la Nouvelle de l'Acad√©mie fran√ßaise, 1990.

His parents were M√≠rz√° Mu·∏•sin Afn√°n, a cousin of the B√°b, and T√∫b√° Kh√°num. His maternal grandparents were  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°, the successor to the Bah√° º√≠ founder-prophet Bah√° ºu'll√°h, and Munirih Kh√°num. Afnan received his initial education at the LaSallian Coll√®ge des Fr√®res in Haifa and later at the American University of Beirut, where he would graduate in 1923. He would continue to the Sorbonne and Oxford University but financial constraints imposed due to the death of his father as well as the onset of World War II curtailed his studies at those institutions. Despite having been declared a Covenant-breaker by his first cousin Shoghi Effendi, the Guardian of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith, in 1971 Afnan established a scholarship, the Fuad Muhsin Afnan Memorial Fund, for \\"Bahai students in need\\" at the American University of Beirut in honor of his younger brother who died in 1941 during an aerial bombardment in London where he was volunteering as an Air Raid Warden. Afnan never married and did not have any children. Academic career In 1947, Afnan produced the first direct translation of Aristotle's Poetics from the Greek into Persian. Upon seeing this work, the Iranian poet Mehdi Akhavan-Sales serialized this translation in the literary magazine Iran-e Ma (Our Iran), of which he was the editor. He praised Afnan with a poem published at the end of the series which was also published in his 1951 collection Arghanoon (ÿßÿ±ÿ∫ŸÜŸàŸÜ), which literally translates as Organon. Afnan obtained his PhD from Pembroke College, Cambridge in 1956, and was a lecturer in Persian at the University of Cambridge from 1958 to 1961, where he collaborated with Arthur John Arberry. He continued to produce academic works, including translations and lexicons of philosophical terminology. As late as 2006, Seyyed Hossein Nasr noted in his work Islamic Philosophy from Its Origin to the Present, that \\"There is not in fact even one satisfactory philosophical dictionary of Arabic and Persian terms with English equivalents. The only work of this kind available is that of Suhail Afnan, A Philosophical Lexicon in Persian and Arabic (Dar al Mashreq, Beirut, 1969). This work is, however, far from being adequate, especially as far as technical vocabulary of later schools of Islamic philosophy is concerned.\\" Afnan passed away in 1990 in Istanbul where he was conducting research at the Topkapƒ± Palace library.

She was also a painter and philanthropist of the Joseon (Chos≈èn) era. She wrote one of the first cookbooks in Korea penned by a woman, which was also written in the Korean alphabet. The text in which it was written is significant, as the official script at that time was Chinese. It is also significant as the book uniquely presents a means of preparing food, expanding the study of food from its medicinal properties to actual preparation. Early life Jang Gye-hyang was born on 24 November 1598 in Andong, Gyeongsang Province, Korea as the only daughter of Jang Heung-Hyo and Andong Kwon (). Jang's father was a well-known Neo-Confucian scholar, who taught many students in his home. Besides listening to their studies, Jang would snoop in her father's library and study books, writing and philosophy. During the Joseon era, education of women emerged, though it was by far still a male dominated domain and restricted mainly to the upper classes. Typically in the period, women studied Confucian philosophy and morality, but pursuit of education for women was not concerned with teaching practical skills. By the time she was ten, she had mastered writing and by thirteen was writing poetry. Some of her early works included \\"Ode to the Saint\\", \\"Sound of Rain\\" and \\"Crane White Hair\\", all of which showed a mature vision of life and impressed her father. During this time, she also painted works and created embroideries, though few survive. When she was 19, Jang married Yi Si-myeong, as his second wife, after being introduced to him by her father. Later life After Jang married, the couple first lived in the seaport town of Yeonghae. Later, they built a house in a mountain village in North Gyeongsang Province named Seokgye, famous for being the home town of the novelist Yi Mun-yol. She raised her own seven children, as well as the two children from her husband's first marriage. During the Second Manchu invasion of Korea in 1636, she opened her home to assist those who were suffering from deprivations during the war. She also planted an orchard of acorn trees so that the poor would always have a source of food. Because of a postscript written by Jang, about her age and waning vision, it is generally assumed that she wrote her cookbook in her later years in the 1670s. While instructional books about food had begun to appear in Korea during the sixteenth century, most were written in encyclopedic language focusing on the medicinal properties of food and followed the custom of using classical Chinese in the text. Jang's cookbook, Eumsik Dimibang () was written in the Korean alphabet. Often credited as the first cookbook in the Hangul script, it contains recipes and instructions for using utensils to cook 146 dishes, including beverages, dumplings, meats, noodles, seafood, soups, and vegetables. Jang was explicit in her instructions of food and drink preparation, showing that she had knowledge of cooking processes, which made her cookbook unique from previously created volumes. Eumsik Dimibang may not be the first cookbook written by a woman, as one, containing 20 recipes by Lady Choi, who died in 1660, may have preceded Jang's book. Choi's first name is unknown. It was common in the Joseon era for women to be known by their region of origin and their surname. Death and legacy Jang died on 7 July 1680 in Seokbochon village in Yeongyang County, of the Gyeongsang Province, Her cookbook, was not printed in her lifetime, but was found in the home of Yi Karam () in 1960 and subsequently published in its entirety by Kim Say≈èp. Her writings show that some women challenged convention in the Joseon age and her cookbook is a valuable tool which moved cooking from the realm of family members teaching other family members into a field of study. The dishes that she designed are featured at the Korea House Restaurant of central Seoul's Jung District. The Ministry of Tourism has offered tours of significant sites mentioned and related to the book and it has a dedicated page as part of the Google Cultural Institute.

It was originally created by a Royal decree of 28 July 1816 as a single grade medal to reward acts of courage displayed by French nationals on foreign soil. An 1861 Imperial decree saw it be split into the silver and gold grades. The year 1887 saw the addition of swords to the medal for award to both French or allied military personnel for acts of courage in favour of the French in time of war. Although still bestowed in wartime for courage, the modern award is now aimed at rewarding civil servants of the ministry for Foreign Affairs.  Award statute  Currently, the Honour medal of Foreign Affairs is intended to reward honorable service by French diplomats and civil servants stationed outside of France. It can also be awarded to French nationals and foreigners for exceptional service to France or that have accomplished acts of courage in assistance to French nationals either in peace or wartime. Military awards are often bestowed on order of the French president, hence the common practice of calling it the President‚Äôs medal. President Raymond Poincar√© bestowed many such medals to French and foreign nationals during World War I. The Honour medal of Foreign Affairs is currently divided into three grades, bronze, silver and gold. When awarded for service, the bronze grade is awarded for no less than 20 years of service, the silver grade may be awarded a minimum of eight years later, the gold grade, seven years after the silver. The Honour medal of Foreign Affairs may be exceptionally awarded regardless of seniority and set quotas to reward bravery and dedication. It can be awarded, also regardless of seniority and set quotas, if the recipient was wounded or killed in the line of duty. The wartime award with swords is bestowed as follows: *In bronze to privates; *In silver to non-commissioned officers; *In gold (silver- gilt prior to 2010) to officers. Award description The Honour medal of Foreign Affairs, a design of engraver Daniel Dupuis, is a 27mm in diameter circular medal in bronze, silver or gold. The obverse bears the relief effigy of the republic surrounded by the relief inscription \\"R√âPUBLIQUE FRAN√áAISE\\" () along the left and right circumference. The reverse bears a crown of half laurel and half oak leaves with the relief inscription \\"AFFAIRES √âTRANG√àRES\\" () with a bare center destined to receive the recipient‚Äôs name and year of award. The medal hangs from a silk moir√© tricolour ribbon composed of three equal blue-white-red vertical stripes.

Karacas (born March 8, 1975) is an American musician, animator, voice actor, director and writer, known for creating Superjail! and Ballmastrz: 9009 for Adult Swim. He is also known for directing the Cartoon Network series Robotomy. Life and career As a child, Karacas frequently drew, with inspiration from comic book superheroes and Star Wars characters to Family Feud scenarios, often with violent themes (though Karacas has explained that he in actuality is \\"a very non-confrontational person\\"). Karacas went on to study film and animation at the Rhode Island School of Design, though he wanted to originally get into live action material. For his senior film project, Karacas created the student film Space War, which raised his profile via showings at animation festivals. Karacas began his career in the animation industry at MTV Animation, where he served as a background designer for Daria. He is a founding member and guitar player for the band Cheeseburger, and he also worked with title sequences, animation, and illustration for VBS.tv and Vice magazine. While working on Daria, around 2001, Karacas and friend Stephen Warbrick created the short film Barfight and presented it for showing at numerous film festivals, though it was rejected at all of them. Dispirited, Karacas spent time working on his band. Several years later, Barfight caught the attention of Adult Swim, who allowed them and Ben Gruber to create a show of their own called Superjail!. Superjail! was originally animated by Augenblick Studios in the pilot episode and first season, but was later animated by Titmouse, Inc. from seasons two to four. However, the series ended its run in 2014. While working on Superjail!, Karacas worked on several other projects, including directing ten episodes of the short-lived Cartoon Network animated series Robotomy, which ran from 2010 to 2011, and writing new material with his bandmates of Cheeseburger. After Superjail!, Karacas would later move on to create another show for Adult Swim, titled Ballmastrz: 9009, which premiered in 2018. The show was renewed for a second season, which began airing February 23, 2020. Influences Karacas' influences include Tex Avery, child art, Bob Clampett, John Kricfalusi, Vince Collins, Sally Cruikshank, Nick Cross, Fleischer Studios, Hanna-Barbera, Tom Ruegger, The Simpsons, The Itchy & Scratchy Show, Looney Tunes, Mad, Jay Ward, Joe Murray, Aaahh!!!

Description  During the Ordovician, the Famatinian orogeny on Gondwana's western margin laid down large volcanic deposits. Some of these were later found to be younger, of Carboniferous-Pennsylvanian age. In the Las Lozas valley, this younger unit is thick and dominated by rhyolite. It lies beneath Paleozoic sediments and above a metamorphic basement. This volcanic activity occurred concurrently with crustal extension, which may be associated either with the Famatinian orogeny, the Achalian orogeny or a separate event. The Las Lozas unit has been dated at 320 million years, with previous dates for other units being between 336-298 million years. The rocks erupted during this volcanic episode were formed from much older crust of Cryogenian age, based on isotope dating of zircons. This older crust may have formed when Rodinia broke up. The structure of the deposits indicates that explosive eruptions involving lava domes were the principal sources of the Las Lozas volcanic deposits. Also present basalts formed lava flows, which may have originated from the lava domes as well. The activity occurred at high temperatures and was issued by fissure vents.

His most notable work is Leys d'amors (\\"Laws of Love\\"), a treatise on rhetoric and grammar that achieved great notoriety and, beyond the Occitan, influenced poets writing in Catalan as well as in Galician or Italian, for which they served as a reference. The occasion for its composition was the founding in 1323 of the Consistori de la Sobregaya Companhia del Gay Saber (\\"Consistory of the Happy Company of the Gay Science\\") at Toulouse. The consistory consisted of seven members who organized poetic contests and rewarded lyric poems that best imitated the style of the 12th- and 13th-century troubadours. Molinier was not an original member of the consistory, but he was its chancellor in 1348, when he was tasked with codifying the principles of Occitan lyric poetry. In this work he had a collaborator, Marc Bartholomieu. A final version was approved by the consistory in 1356.. Two pages from the manuscript of the Leys d'Amors.The original Leys d'amors dates to 1328. The archives of the present-day Acad√©mie des Jeux floraux (a descendant of the Consistory del Gay Saber) contains a folio copy of this edition under the title by which the work has become known. It contains many subsequently deleted passages and numerous editorial markings. A folio copy of the final and definitive text is also in the archive of the Acad√©mie, under the title Las Flors del gay saber (\\"The Flowers of the Gay Science\\"). It contains all the deletions, modifications and additions indicated in the unedited 1328 text. This manuscript received a critical edition in 1841‚Äì43. A copy of the latter text is also found in the Archives of the Crown of Aragon and a verse edition is found in the National Library of Catalonia. Further copies based on the Catalan manuscripts are found in Paris, Madrid and Toulouse. The Leys d'amors is divided into five parts. Part I contains some philosophy of language, theory of poetry, epistemology and rules of orthography. Part II deals with rules for versification and the issue of literary genre. Part III is about grammar and contains both classical material borrowed from Donatus, Priscian, Isidore and Alexander de Villa Dei, as well as modern material on the system of declensions in Occitan, the use of articles, the nature of the sentence and semantics. In terms of linguistic varieties, this section recommends the us acostumat (\\"customary usage\\") over local customs. Part IV discusses errors (barbarisms and solecisms) and bad verse. Part V covers practical considerations. The Leys d'amors owes a debt to Brunetto Latini's Li livres dou Tresor and Albertano di Brescia's Ars loquendi et tacendi. It was in turn especially influential in Catalonia. Its influence can be seen in Luys d'Aver√ß√≥'s Torcimany and Joan de Castellnou's Compendi de la coneixan√ßa dels vices en els dictats del Gai Saber. Its influence can even be seen in the Castilian lyrical grammar of Enrique de Villena.

Ceto, who had been summoned by Medusa, changed shape from a monstrous creature to a humanoid woman, and mourned her daughter Medusa.Batwoman #17 (April 2013) Powers and abilities Medusa has the ability to transform any living creature into stone if they look into her eyes. In her Post-Crisis depiction, Medusa has been seen with either a serpentine body and a humanoid body with golden wings. This iteration's follicle coils could spit burning toxins which sear and poison on contact and was blessed by the gods with physicality rivaling that of Wonder Woman. An unknown facet, either thanks to blessings from the almighty or Circe's spell craft; gave Medusa's voice a hypnotic chime with which she could compel others to turn towards her gaze.

History  The NWLB was established by President Franklin D. Roosevelt under Executive Order 9017, with William Hammatt Davis as its chair. It was charged with acting as an arbitration tribunal in labor-management dispute cases in order to prevent work stoppages which might hinder the war effort. It administered wage control in national industries such as automobiles, shipping, railways, airlines, telegraph lines, and mining. The Board was originally divided into twelve Regional Administrative Boards which handled both labor dispute settlement and wage stabilization functions for specific geographic regions. The national Board further decentralized in 1943, when it established special tripartite commissions and panels to deal with specific industries on a national basis. Roosevelt's successor Harry S. Truman issued Executive Order 9672 ceasing operations of the National War Labor Board on December 31, 1945. Labor disputes were thereafter arbitrated by the National Labor Relations Board, the predecessor agency that had been set up in 1935.

Biography  His father was a master cooper and innkeeper. He began his studies with an apprenticeship to the church painter, Peter Thomas (1854-1935). In 1908, he passed the journeyman's examination and found employment as a \\"painter's assistant\\" to at the Trier Arts and Crafts School. Four years later, he enlisted in the Army, but served only a short time before being discharged due to a chronic illness. He then continued his education at the Hochschule f√ºr Grafik und Buchkunst in Leipzig, where he studied etching with Alois Kolb. He was there from 1915 to 1918, when he returned to Trier and took over the painting class from Tr√ºmper, who had been drafted into the Landsturm. By special permission of Richard Riemerschmid, Director of the Arts and Crafts School in Munich, he was able to spend the years 1920-1922 studying with Robert Engels and Adolf Schinnerer. It was then he developed a style that combined Post-Impressionism with Expressionism. View of Trier from the West In 1925, he got married and settled in Trier, where he worked as a free-lance artist until 1930, when he returned to the Arts and Crafts School as a teacher. During those years he was, however, well-connected; belonging to numerous local and regional professional associations and art societies. His \\"View of Trier from the West\\" was presented as a gift to Chancellor Gustav Stresemann. In addition to his paintings, he illustrated travel brochures, provided drawings to newspapers, created advertisements (mostly for wine and tobacco) and produced designs for the local Notgeld during the period of hyperinflation. In his last years, as his health declined, he devoted himself mostly to interior design; notably the Town Hall in Wittlich. Shortly after the Nazi takeover (just before his death) he was admitted to the Trier branch of the \\"Reich Cartel of Fine Arts\\" and given a license to exhibit. In 1959, his widow wrote a will leaving his works to the City of Trier. After her death in 1976, over 400 works were transferred to the . A street in Trier has been named after him.

History  The board was appointed by President Woodrow Wilson. It was composed of twelve members, including five representatives each from business and the American Federation of Labor (AFL), as well as co-chairs Frank P. Walsh and former president William Howard Taft. The decisions of the NWLB generally supported and strengthened the position of labor. Although it opposed the disruption of war production by strikes, it supported an eight- hour day for workers, equal pay for women, and the right to organize unions and bargain collectively. Although the NWLB had no coercive enforcement power, Wilson generally ensured compliance with its decisions. In general, the relative strength of organized labor in America grew substantially during the war. Union membership almost doubled after the formation of the NWLB. Of note, membership in the AFL rose from two million in 1916 to over three million in 1919. By the end of the decade, fifteen percent of the nonagricultural work force was unionized. In all, the board ruled on 1,245 cases. Almost ninety percent of them sprang from worker complaints, and five skilled trades accounted for 45 percent. Of the cases, 591 were dismissed, 315 were referred to other federal labor agencies, and 520 resulted in formal awards or findings. In reaching decisions, the board was aided by an office and investigative staff of 250 people. Approximately seven hundred thousand workers in one thousand establishments were directly affected. The board was disbanded on May 31, 1919, some six and a half months after the end of the war.

Overview The Owl Tower was constructed as a response to the issues regarding the utilization of already existing buildings, namely to specialize skyscrapers in the area, make use of available land effectively, prevent a mixed-use of buildings, and also to encourage people to live in the Ikebukuro district. Its name references the mascot of the district. The Owl Tower is located near the Air Rise Tower, and close to the Higashi-Ikebukuro Station, to which it is directly connected by an underground promenade, and the Sunshine City complex with the Sunshine 60 skyscraper, the tallest building in Tokyo from 1978 to 1991. The skyscraper was built on a lot with an area of , of which is occupied by the building itself. Reinforced concrete, steel, and glass was used during its construction, which costed approximately 30 billion yen. The building was designed and constructed by the Taisei Corporation. The city planning decision to built the Owl Tower was made in May 2004, and the planning permission was given in January 2006. The construction began in October 2007, and was completed in January 2011. In late March of the same year, the building was ready to be moved in. Although the Owl Tower is mainly a residential building, some storeys are meant for office or commercial use. Stores are located in the 1st basement and on the 1st floor, while offices can be found from the 2nd to the 6th floor. Apartments are situated on the remaining floors, up to the 52nd.

Career Although Ina was listed as Society Editor, Chronicle-News in the Trinidad, Colorado City Directory of 1907, she also reported on sports, particularly baseball, and was named sporting editor of the paper in 1906. At the time, Trinidad was a thriving mining town and attending a baseball game was a popular pastime for the populace of ~10,000. None of the reporters at The Chronicle-News knew very much about baseball or how to keep a box score but Ina was an expert because she had played baseball and learned all about the game from her little brother Robert. Thus, Ina became the paper's baseball reporter and her box scores were judged to be perfect.Business section of Trinidad, Colorado Alfred Damon Runyon, who himself had been the sporting editor of The Rocky Mountain News in Denver, Colorado tried to establish a professional baseball league in Colorado in 1907 by attracting talented amateurs from around the country to play against some of the established teams in the state.

On one side was Battling Nelson, the man of jabs and uppercuts, on the other side was Miss Ina E.

After the Cub's series victory in 1908, treasurer Tim Murnane of the newly formed Baseball Writers Association nominated Ina as an honorary member. She was approved and gained access to all American and National League ballparks with her membership. After her time as sporting editor of the Chronicle-News in Trinidad, Colorado, Ina worked for the Fort Worth Record in Texas and The Denver Post in Colorado. She also covered the 1911 World Series. Life Ina Eloise Young was born in Brownwood, Texas on February 22, 1881. Her parents were Louisa and Robert Young. Ina was a middle child with an older sister Zoe (born 1879) and a younger brother Robert Jr. (born 1883). By 1889, the Young family resided in Trinidad, Colorado where Ina grew up riding horses and was frequently pictured holding her riding crop. \\"I ride horseback, but all western girls do that. In covering events that happen in the mining camps around here a horse is the quickest method of transportation.\\" Ina played basketball and fenced at the University of Colorado at Boulder but despite good grades, left college and began working at the Chronicle-News in Trinidad.

It has rough, scaly bark on the lower part of the trunk, smooth bark above, narrow lance-shaped to curved adult leaves, flower buds in groups of seven, creamy white flowers and cylindrical to narrow urn-shaped flowers. Description Eucalyptus dundasii is a tree that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. It has rough, scaly or tesselatted grey-black, grey or black bark on the lower part of the trunk, smooth greyish over coppery bark above. Young plants and coppice regrowth have broadly lance-shaped leaves that are long and wide. Adult leaves are the same glossy green on both sides, narrow lance- shaped, long and wide on a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in leaf axils on an unbranched peduncle long, the individual buds sessile or on a pedicel up to long. Mature buds are more or less cylindrical, long and wide with a beaked operculum. Flowering occurs between February and July and the flowers are creamy white. The fruit is a woody, cylindrical to urn-shaped capsule long and wide with the valves enclosed below the rim. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus dundasii was first formally described by the botanist Joseph Maiden in 1916 and published in the Journal and Proceedings of the Royal Society of New South Wales. The type specimen was collected near Dundas by Ludwig Diels in 1901. The specific epithet (dundasii) refers to the type location, Dundas, an abandoned mining town. Distribution Dundas blackbutt is found on flats and in and around salt lakes in open forest and woodland. It occurs from near Lake Barlee to Salmon Gums and the Fraser Range in the Coolgardie, Mallee and Murchison biogeogaphic regions. This tree is part of a mixed arid to semi-arid woodland community along with E. loxophleba, E. wandoo, E. eremophila, E. salmonophloia, E. lesouefii and E. torquata. Species in the understorey include Eucalyptus flocktoniae and other mallees. Shrubs found are dependent on the salinity levels, with Acacia species dominating the areas of low salinity and Eremophila and Atriplex species found in more saline areas.

Geography  Bauple is principally flat farming land (elevation 50 metres) with Mount Bauple rising to 450 metres in the west of the locality with some hills (elevation 150 metres) in the north-east. The town is located centrally within the locality. The Bruce Highway passes through the location from south to north, bypassing the town to the east. The town is now accessed Bauple Drive, the former route of the Bruce Highway before the town was bypassed. Sugarcane is the major crop in the area.  History  Sugarcane workers in the canefields in the Bauple district, circa 1920 The town was originally called Raby but the name was changed to Bauple on 20 November 1896, named after Mount Bauple. Bauple is believed to be derived from an Aboriginal word baupval in the Kabi language referring to a frilled lizard. In the Dreamtime, the spirit of the lizard guarded the sacred place on the mountain where stone axes were obtained. In 1858 bauple nuts were discovered in Bauple; they are now known as macadamia nuts. The Mount Bauple sugar mill was established in 1896; it was the largest in the district. It closed in 1951, as the sugarcane was then being sent to mills in Nambour and Maryborough. Mount Bauple Provisional School opened on 7 February 1887. In 1888 it renamed Mount Bopple Provisional School. On 1 January 1909 it became Mount Bopple State School. It closed in September 1928 due to low student numers. It reopened in March 1931, but and closed permanently on 10 February 1933. Raby State School opened on 8 July 1901 with 58 students. It was renamed Bauple State School on 16 May 1935.

Early uses=Sea Navies were the first military forces to adopt the newly developed electric Arc lamp Searchlights (S/Ls) in the later 19th Century, to illuminate potential targets at night. Before the Bombardment of Alexandria in 1882, the Royal Navy force employed its searchlights to prove that Ahmed ‚ÄòUrabi's troops were strengthening the fortifications at night in defiance of the British ultimatum.Maurice, p. 10. Similarly, searchlights were also used to defend Ports against incursions by warships at night: in Britain this role became the responsibility of the fortress engineers and electrical engineers of the Royal Engineers (RE).Short et al, p. 14. Land A searchlight set up at the Wesselton Mine during the Siege of Kimberley during the 2nd Boer War. Early in the Second Boer War, Colonel Robert Baden-Powell improvised searchlights to deter night attacks on his lines during the Siege of Mafeking. Soon afterward Major Rookes Crompton led a detachment of the Electrical Engineers Volunteers to South Africa where they operated electric arc lamp S/Ls of his own design, the first use of such equipment by the RE on campaign. They provided a primitive 'artificial moonlight' by reflecting the searchlight beams from clouds.Watson, pp. 41‚Äì4.Keith Brigstock 'Royal Artillery Searchlights', presentation to Royal Artillery Historical Society at Larkhill, 17 January 2007. Searchlight history at 873 Movement Light Squadron site. After the onset of trench warfare in World War I, the Tyne Electrical Engineers provided detachments to operate oxy-acetylene S/Ls in forward areas to assist in night defence, but these proved a failure.Short et al, p. 106. Air World War I saw massive expansion of searchlight use in Anti-Aircraft (AA) defence to illuminate Zeppelins and bomber aircraft at night so that they could be engaged by AA guns and fighter aircraft.Short, pp. 42‚Äì200.Routledge, pp. 3‚Äì35. This became the predominant military use for searchlights between the World Wars, and in the 1930s the threat from Luftwaffe bombers in the event of war with Germany led to rapid expansion in the number of AA S/L units in Britain's part-time Territorial Army. These were frequently converted infantry battalions transferred to the RE or the RA. They formed part of Anti-Aircraft Command in Air Defence of Great Britain, but some units were also sent overseas after the outbreak of war to supplement the small number of Regular Army S/L units in defending ports, bases, airfields and other vital points.Routledge, pp. 55‚Äì67. World War II A British AA S/L deployed early in World War II. All the Army's AA S/L units were transferred to the Royal Artillery during 1940. Their primary role was to illuminate enemy aircraft for AA guns or night fighters to engage, although providing directional beacons for friendly aircraft was a valuable secondary role. Searchlight units scored occasional successes by dazzling enemy pilots,Digby Planck, p. 228. but attempts to set up dazzle barrages (eg a 'Cardiff‚ÄìNewport Dazzle Area')37 S/L Rgt War Diary January‚ÄìJune 1942, The National Archives (TNA), Kew file WO 166/7787. were not particularly successful. Other uses for S/Ls were slower to emerge. Alamein At the time of Battle of Alamein, Eighth Army had two Troops of 27th (London Electrical Engineers) S/L Rgt under command for area AA protection, but five of these lights were used to assist assaulting troops in direction-keeping during the night attack that launched the battle (Operation Lightfoot). No attempt was made to illuminate the sky (the battle was fought in full moonlight, though this was much obscured by dust).Joslen, pp. 566, 576.Pitt, p. 298. Sicily & Italy Battlefield illumination was also used in the campaigns in Sicily and Italy up to and including the Gothic line. It was used to illuminate the battlefield for not only infantry attack but also, because of the ridge nature of the terrain, catching out German Artillery in the full glare of light on the opposite slopes. Careful reconnoitring of the area and individual placement achieved excellent results. The 1st Canadian Group had with them 422nd S/L Battery who undertook this task successfully. Normandy By the time of Operation Overlord and the Normandy campaign in the summer of 1944 the Luftwaffe was greatly weakened, and the use of radar by AA guns and night-fighters was widespread, so the S/L units in 21st Army Group were under-employed. Some lights from 474th S/L Battery were given a subsidiary coast defence role to protect the anchorages from E-Boat attacks.101 Sub-Area Notes, 18 March 1944, TNA file WO 171/1085. By late August, as 21st Army Group broke out of the beachhead, enemy night air raids were rare and 557th S/L Bty was used to provide floodlighting for round-the- clock bridge-building by the Royal Engineers; this soon became a routine task for S/L units.557 S/L Bty War Diary July‚ÄìDecember 1944, TNA file WO 171/1214. As the advance across France gathered momentum, newly arrived batteries of 41st and 42nd S/L Rgts found themselves providing security lighting for Prisoner of war (PoW) camps.80 AA Bde War Diary 1944, TNA file WO 171/1085. 90 cm Projector Anti-Aircraft, displayed at Fort Nelson, Portsmouth The major new use for S/L units in this campaign was to reflect light off the cloudbase to provide 'artificial moonlight' or 'movement light' (also known as 'Monty's moonlight' after 21st Army Group's commander, General Sir Bernard Montgomery) in support of night operations. 344th, 356th and 474th Independent S/L Batteries pioneered this technique using their mobile 90 cm searchlights.Routledge, pp. 314, 317. On 9 July, 474 Bty sent six S/L detachments to provide artificial moonlight in the forward area for 43rd (Wessex) Division, which was moving up to its starting positions for Operation Jupiter. Three days later, the battery repeated the process for 53rd (Welsh) Division.474 S/L Bty War Diary, June‚ÄìDecember 1944, TNA file WO 171/1213.Ellis, p. 315. The technique was next used operationally to assist the assembly of troops for Operation Greenline on the night of 14/15 July, when the drivers of 15th (Scottish) Division 'found the light a great help to them in finding their way up the pot-holed track through the blinding dust'.Martin, pp. 66‚Äì9. The S/L positions were subjected to light retaliatory shelling and mortar fire and to low-level air attack, suffering some casualties. However, during the fighting the following night, a jammed column of troops and vehicles was dangerously silhouetted in the movement light, while elsewhere a smoke cloud blotted it out.Martin, p. 71‚Äì5. Nevertheless, from then on the S/L batteries were regularly called upon to send detachments to provide movement light to support British and Canadian formations as the Battle for Caen progressed This innovation in 21st Army Group narrowly preceded similar experiments by Eighth Army on the Italian front. On 7/8 August, 344th S/L Bty provided lighting for II Canadian Corps' night attack south of Caen (Operation Totalize); officers of the newly arrived 557th S/L Bty attended to gain experience in this new technique.344 S/L Bty War Diary June‚ÄìDecember 1944, TNA file WO 171/1207. The advance After 21st Army Group broke out of its Normandy beachhead, 557th S/L Bty went to Le Havre where it provided artificial moonlight for the attack by I Corps on the night of 10/11 September (Operation Astonia). Here the technique proved particularly valuable for ensuring safe passage through gaps cut in the minefields. The battery then went on to provide lighting for the continued fighting in the town and docks.Routledge, p. 317.Doherty, p 108. In October, 557th S/L Bty joined II Canadian Corps in the Battle of the Scheldt (Operation Switchback), providing 'moonlight' for the attack on South Beveland and AA defence for the Canadian gun lines.76 AA Bde War Diary, 1944, TNA file WO 171/1084. Afterwards, it joined 344th, 356th, and 474th Btys in providing light for bridge and airfield construction, and AA defence for the bridges at Grave, Mook and Nijmegen that had been captured during Operation Market Garden. At Nijmegen the two vital bridges were under regular attack from the air and from frogmen with explosive charges, so that searchlights had to sweep the river as well as the sky.557 S/L Bty War Diary October‚ÄìDecember 1944, summary at RA Netherlands.Routledge, p. 325, Table LII, p. 331‚Äì2. On 4 November C Troop of 356 S/L Bty was detached to 51st (Highland) Division for its first experience with artificial moonlight. This was for an assault crossing of the Afwateringkanal and River Maas and subsequent bridgelaying. The troop stayed on to illuminate bridge repairs on the second night. After a difficult move, with several vehicles ditched, the troop was repositioned to join 474 S/L Bty in supporting a night move by 154 Bde into Nederweert on 9 November, during which the troop suffered minor damage from enemy shellfire. After a few nights providing movement light over canal and river bridges, XXX Corps sent C Troop to assist 84th US Division in its attack on Geilenkirchen as part of Operation Clipper. During the preparation period the S/Ls were exposed each night 'to fox the Boche' with 'stooge' beams in different directions. The attack went in at 04.00 on 18 November and the troop provided artificial moonlight until 07.00 to help the Flail tanks and engineers to breach the defences. The following night the troop assisted 43rd (Wessex) Division in the continuing attacks on the Geilenkirchen salient, receiving a retaliatory air raid that caused no damage. Heavy rain fell from 20 November onwards, and finding suitable S/L positions in the mud and minefields was difficult. Eventually the Troop deployed on a Hitler Youth campsite and at the railway station. As 84th Division's operation continued with the capture of Tripsrath, the lights attracted increasing amounts of enemy shellfire, causing minor casualties and damage. On 23 November the S/Ls were doused for a while to allow stretcher bearers to bring in the wounded. On 24 November a US S/L unit arrived to be briefed on the artificial moonlight technique, and the following day C Troop left 84th US Division and rejoined 43rd (Wessex) to resume routine movement light duties.356 S/L Bty War Diary 1944, TNA file 171/1208. Experiments Early in 1945, in preparation for the forthcoming attack in the Klever Reichswald (Operation Veritable), 31st (North Midland) Anti-Aircraft Brigade HQ in Belgium carried out experiments to optimise artificial moonlight techniques to provide lighting for night movement of ground troops, for floodlighting their objectives and for dazzling the defenders. At the end of January 1945, 557th S/L Bty under First Canadian Army command began experiments to put a searchlight onto a Canadian Ram tank with its turret removed, with the electrical generator carried in a second accompanying tank. (The obsolete Rams were also being used as turretless armoured personnel carriers known as Kangaroos.) A section of 557 S/L Bty based at Nijmegen began operating these vehicles in February in support of 15th (Scottish) Division.557 S/L Bty War Diary 1945, TNA file WO 171/5103. Grant CDL of 79th Armoured Division, with S/L and dummy gun in upper turret, 75 mm gun in side sponson. The units involved were apparently unaware of the existence of the Canal Defence Lights (CDLs), which had been designed earlier in the war to equip night fighting tank battalions both to illuminate and to dazzle the enemy. The CDL consisted of a powerful searchlight fitted to a Matilda tank, replacing the turret and main armament. Later the Matilda CDLs were replaced by Grant tank CDLs, which retained the 75 mm main gun in its sponson. These weapons had been developed under great secrecy and by January 1942 a whole tank brigade had begun training on CDLs, later joining 79th Armoured Division, which concentrated all the specialised armour units training for Operation Overlord.Scull.Ellis, Vol II, p. 384.Doherty, pp. 41‚Äì2, 48. In the end only one of the CDL units, 49th Royal Tank Regiment, went to Normandy, and it landed too late for Operation Totalize. The regiment was later converted into an Armoured Personnel Carrier Regiment (49 APCR) equipped with Kangaroos, and the CDLs were returned to store.Doherty, p. 102. 557th Battery's experiments were not continued, and CDLs were brought back out of storage for the assault crossing of the Rhine (Operation Plunder). Germany When Operation Veritable opened on 9 February, 356th, 474th and 557th Btys provided 'moonlight' for XXX Corps, VIII Corps and II Canadian Corps respectively. Four of 557th Bty's lights were mounted on steel towers specially erected by the RE. For the attacks on the Siegfried line (Westwall) bunkers, which took place on the night of D/D +1, part of the Klever Reichswald was floodlit, and some S/L positions were sited with the intention of dazzling the defenders while lighting up the obstacles.Routledge, p. 350.Martin, pp. 229, 236.356 M/L Bty War Diary January‚ÄìAugust 1945, TNA file WO 171/5096. During the battle, 557th Bty's lights were called upon to illuminate roads to help a Canadian brigade in danger from floods ‚Äì presaging their later peacetime use in civil defence. After their success in Veritable, three of the S/L batteries providing movement light were officially redesignated 'Moonlight' (M/L) batteries, and two further batteries (581st and 582nd) were formed. Each was assigned to an army corps.Routledge, p. 353. 356th Moonlight Battery continued with XXX Corps, whose commander, Lt-Gen Brian Horrocks, had highly commended the battery for its work in Veritable. However, in mid-March, while the battery was preparing for the Rhine crossing (Operation Plunder) it was ordered to revert to AA duties and transfer to 107th AA Bde under First Canadian Army. The whole battery, together with Horrocks and his Corps Commander Royal Artillery, resisted the transfer, and 356th M/L Bty continued planning for Plunder 'as if nothing had happened', while taking the precaution of refitting its lights with AA radar. Trials of various S/L arrangements were carried out on the River Maas, and the plan decided on for the Rhine was for four banks of lights, one behind the assembly areas, two interspersed among them, and one well forward, close to the west bank of the river, a total of 33 S/L projectors per corps. The necessary build-up of material for Operation Plunder involved much night movement, and the deployment of lights included deception sites. The lights were used for several nights before the actual assault to 'accustom the Germans to their use'.Routledge, p. 351.Saunders, p. 58. For the assault crossing, 49 APCR formed 'B' Independent Squadron equipped with Grant CDLs, assigning a half squadron to each of the attacking corps, XII and XXX. During the assault on Rees by 51st (Highland) Division the Grants both illuminated the crossing and engaged the enemy on the far bank with their 75mm guns.Doherty, pp. 166‚Äì7. The lighting was so intense that many of the troops crossing in the 'Buffalo' amphibious vehicles felt that they were dangerously silhouetted against the water.Saunders, p. 68. After the Rhine had been crossed, 21st Army Group had to execute two further assault river crossings as it advanced across Germany: the Weser, where 581st M/L Bty supported XII Corps, and the Elbe (Operation Enterprise), with 581st M/L Bty in support of VIII Corps.Routledge, p. 362.Ellis, Vol II, pp. 306, 337. 15th (Scottish) Division's experience of the Elbe crossing was described thus: ::'The sky was densely overcast: so much so that the whole programme of air support for next morning had been cancelled. Yet so bright was the Movement Light of the many searchlights that slanted their diffused beams into the clouds from positions in rear that onlookers could stand unseen in the shadows of Artlenburg with nothing but the waters of the Elbe, molten and glowing, between them and the enemy'.Martin, p. 326. After VE Day the moonlight batteries carried out various occupation duties in Germany until their turn for demobilisation came round. Often this involved security lighting on important rivers, and for PoW camps.Unit war diaries. List of Moonlight Batteries in World War II By the end of the war in Europe, there were five independent Moonlight Batteries operating in 21st Army Group: * 344th Moonlight Battery: originally raised in 1936 as part of 36th (Middlesex) Anti-Aircraft Battalion, Royal Engineers, the battery later formed the cadre for 58th (Middlesex) Anti-Aircraft Battalion, Royal Engineers, transferred to the Royal Artillery in 1940 and became an independent mobile battery in 1943.Frederick, p. 870. * 356th Moonlight Battery: originally a battery of 39th Searchlight Regiment, itself converted from the 7th Battalion, Lancashire Fusiliers in 1936; it became an independent mobile battery in 1943.Frederick, p. 866. * 557th Moonlight Battery: originally a battery of 92nd S/L Regiment, RA formed in 1941; it became an independent mobile battery in 1943.Frederick, p. 875. * 581st Moonlight Battery: formed as a duplicate by 344th Bty in March 1945.Frederick, p. 862. * 582nd Moonlight Battery: formed from part of 557 Bty in March 1945. In addition the following independent AA S/L Bty also operated in the M/L role on occasions, without change of designation: * 474th Searchlight Battery: raised in March 1940; after forming part of 76th Searchlight Regiment it became an independent mobile battery in 1943.Farndale, Annex M. Postwar The last RA S/L battery formed during World War II, 571 (Independent) S/L Bty raised on 1 April 1945, was redesignated 339 Movement Light Bty in the Regular Army on 1 April 1947. It was reduced to 4 Movement Light Troop on 14 October 1948, and disbanded on 1 February 1949.Frederick, p. 939. When the Territorial Army was reconstituted in 1947, it included a number of Movement Light batteries: * 856th Movement Light Battery (Devon & Cornwall Fortress Engineers): reconstituted from 432nd Light Anti-Aircraft Battery with HQ at PlymouthLitchfield, p. 48.Frederick, p. 1031. * 858th Movement Light Battery (Carmarthenshire Fortress): reconstituted from 484th (Carmarthen) S/L Bty with HQ at LlanelliLitchfield, p. 83. * 871st (Independent) Movement Light Battery (Green Howards): reconstituted from 6th Bn Green Howards with HQ at MiddlesbroughFrederick, p. 107.Frederick, p. 1032.Litchfield, p. 254. * 873rd Movement Light Battery (The Middlesex Regiment): formed from part of 126th (Middlesex) Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment (formerly 60th (Middlesex) S/L Rgt) with HQ at StainesLitchfield, p. 180.Royal Engineers at Stepping Forward.Money Barnes, Appendix V. During the East Coast Floods in February 1953, Q ('Quebec') Battery of 529 LAA/SL Rgt, stationed at Louth, deployed its gun towing vehicles to evacuate civilians from Sutton-on-Sea. It then employed the artificial moonlight technique with its S/Ls to allow round-the-clock working to repair the damaged sea defences, calling in additional lights from TA units across the North and Midlands. This commitment lasted for six weeks. There were organisational changes in 1955, when 871st Bty was disbanded, but a new battery was formed: * 863rd (County of Lincoln) Movement Light Battery: reconstituted from 539th (County of Lincoln) LAA RgtFrederick, p. 1021.Litchfield, p. 144. 856th and 858th M/L Btys were transferred from the RA to the RE in 1956, with 858th being merged into 108 Field Engineer Rgt.RE Rgts 80‚Äì177 at British Army 1945 on. The last RA M/L batteries were also converted to RE in 1961, becoming 863rd (County of Lincoln) Independent Movement Light Squadron and 873rd (Middlesex) Movement Light Squadron respectively. 873 Mov Lt Sqn provided lighting during the construction of the Medway bridges for the M2 motorway in 1962, but its offer to light the rescue efforts after the Aberfan disaster in 1966 was rejected. When the TA was converted into the smaller TAVR in 1967, 873 Sqn was reduced to Battery HQ and one Troop ‚Äì the only dedicated searchlight unit remaining, not only in the British Army but the whole of NATO. It was finally disbanded in 1999. NotesReferences * Maj R. Money Barnes, The Soldiers of London, London: Seeley Service, 1963. * Major L.F.

Language Together with the Waanyi language, Garrwa belongs to the Garrwan language family, and had two dialects: the heavy eastern Guninderri and the light western variety of Garrwa. Its status within the larger Pama-Nyungan family is disputed: though it shares some features, it also displays many innovative forms that are rare in other Australian languages, suggesting that it fits a distinctive typology. Country Tindale calculated the extent of Garrwa lands at approximately . They were in his view an inland people whose northern extension ran only as far as roughly the margins of the coastal plain some from the Gulf of Carpentaria's coastline. Their territory was rocky, crossing the plateau from the Robinson River homestead and the Foelsche River, running as far south as the headwaters of the former and Seigalls Creek Homestead. Their eastern flank went beyond Calvert Hills as far as east to Wollogorang close to the Queensland border and to the Westmoreland outstation. Maps have the Yanyuwa people to the north of the Garrwa, the Waanyi and Gudanji to their south, and the Ganggalida to their east. Today the Garrwa people consider themselves related to the area along the Gulf of Carpentaria coastline of Queensland, around the Wearyan and Robinson Rivers. Two other groups, the Binbinga and Wilangarra became extinct soon after the beginning of white colonisation. The Garrwa habitat extended from the northern tropical, with its mangroves to southern semi-arid inland, with its sandstone gorges. According to the seasons, they would venture into the Bukalara (Barkly Tableland). They see themselves as a freshwater people, distinct from the saltwater peoples to the north and east, harvesting the food-crayfish, turtles, tubers and waterlies- available of the riverine ecosystem together with land game like kangaroo, echidnas and possums. Drawing on a paraphrase by the historian Tony Roberts, the leading modern authority on the Garrwa Ilana Mushin identifies as part of Garrwa lands the area described in the journal kept by Ludwig Leichhardt as he travelled an old aboriginal trade route through the southern coastal area, as that is. The area concerned, now called the Port McArthur Tidal Wetlands System lay around the Robinson and Wearyan rivers, and Leichhardt > described emu traps around waterholes, fish traps and fishing weirs across > rivers, well-used footpaths, major living areas with substantial dwellings, > wells of clear water and a sophisticated method of detoxifying the otherwise > extremely poisonous cycad nuts. There were moderately high concentrations of > people leading an industrious lifestyle. All of this was markedly different > to the stereotyped images of 'savages' leading a 'nomadic' and 'primitive' > existence.' Social organization The Garrwa were divided into clans, the name of which one at least is known. * Wulungwara. (a clan around Wollongorang) History of contact With the onset of white colonization, the Garrwa are known to have moved up to the coast as far as Tully Inlet, and there they began to mix with the Yanyuwa. In 1916 copper was discovered in the area of Redbank in Garrwa territory and thereafter the Redbank Copper Mine was established. The pollution from the overflow of its washed ores has turned the nearby Hanrahan's Creek toxic and seeped over as far as the Wentworth Aggregation wetland, Wollogorang Station and affected sacred aboriginal sites such as Moonlight Falls. Trading Much prized kulunja knife blades of the leilira type were fashioned from quartzite mined at a site 6 miles south of the modern Redbanks Copper Mine, and used as articles of trade by the Garrwa. One particular use for them was as barter to obtain young wives from the Lardil of Mornington Island. An early survey of blood types suggested that the Garrwa had a high B phenotype ratio, a characteristic almost non-existent among Australian Aboriginal people, shared only by the Kaiadilt and Tagalag. The Garrwa were considered to be the main source for the B gene in surrounding continental populations.

Chicheley joined the Board of Admiralty under Prince Rupert in September 1677 but stood down to become Commissioner of the Ordnance in May 1679. He resigned as Commissioner of the Ordnance in January 1682 and returned to the Admiralty Board. After advancement to Senior Naval Lord in January 1690,Rodger, p. 34 he retired from the Board in June 1690. Chicheley died suddenly on 20 March 1691 and was buried at St Giles in the Fields in London. Family Lady Chicheley Chicheley married Isabella, the daughter and coheiress of Sir John Lawson of Alresford, Essex, and the widow of Daniel Norton of Southwick, Hampshire.

It has reddish brown minni ritchi bark, more or less rounded to egg-shaped leaves, glaucous flower buds arranged in groups of seven, creamy white flowers and flattened hemispherical fruit. Description Eucalyptus educta is a spreading, twisted mallee that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. It has rough, reddish brown, minni richi bark and glaucous branchlets. Adult leaves are the same dull greyish green on both sides, more or less rounded to egg-shaped with the narrower end towards the base. They are long and wide, tapering to a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in groups of seven in leaf axils on an unbranched peduncle long, the individual buds on a pedicel long. Mature buds are glaucous, oval, long and wide with a conical operculum up to three times as long as the floral cup. Flowering occurs in March and April and the flowers are creamy white. The fruit is a woody, flattened, hemispherical capsule long and wide with the valves protruding above the rim of the fruit. Taxonomy Eucalyptus educta was first formally described in 1992 by the botanists Lawrence Alexander Sidney Johnson and Ken Hill in the journal Telopea from a specimen collected by Ian Brooker from hills known as \\"The Dromedaries\\" north of Beacon. The specific epithet (educta) is derived from the Latin word eductus meaning \\"drawn out\\", referring to the long operculum. Distribution This mallee has a limited range with two populations occurring on hills near Beacon where it grows in shallow soils among granite rocks. It has been recorded in the Coolgardie, Murchison, Swan Coastal Plain and Yalgoo biogeographic regions of Western Australia. Conservation status Eucalyptus educta is classified as \\"Priority Two\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife meaning that it is poorly known and from only one or a few locations.

Early life and Habsburg service Petroviƒá was born in Siokovac in the Levaƒç region,; and moved to Ostru≈ænica by the Sava. Many Serbs fled across the Danube and Sava into the Military Frontier of the Habsburg Monarchy after increased Ottoman oppression. Petroviƒá and his family moved to Syrmia, and he entered Habsburg service, becoming a border guard. With the outbreak of the Austro-Turkish War (1787‚Äì91), he joined the Serbian Free Corps, a Serb volunteer unit fighting the Ottomans in central Serbia, consequently occupied by the Habsburgs (1788‚Äì92). For his operation, managing to open the Belgrade Fortress Gates, he was awarded the rank of captain. For his service during the war, he was awarded knighthood by Leopold II in 1792. He also served as a volunteer fighting the French. He used his military experience to train Serb rebels in the First Serbian Uprising (1804‚Äì13). The leader of the uprising, Karaƒëorƒëe, who had fought in Petroviƒá's volunteer unit, viewed him as his foster father. Serbian Revolution Petroviƒá returned to Serbia (the Sanjak of Smederevo) in 1804 after the outbreak of the uprising. He distinguished himself throughout the uprising through military skills and prowess. After the liberation of Karanovac (now Kraljevo) in 1805, Karaƒëorƒëe appointed him vojvoda (general). In March 1806, Ottoman commander Suleiman Pasha defeated the Serbian rebel band of Radiƒç Petroviƒá near the Studenica Monastery. He was seriously wounded during the Siege of Belgrade (1806), and became permanently hunched. After recovering, he stayed in Belgrade, and in 1808 became a magistrate. In the following years he took part in the fortification and defence of ƒÜuprija. After the Ottoman suppression of the uprising in 1813, he lived in Syrmia under very modest conditions. After the outbreak of the Second Serbian Uprising (1815), Radiƒç Petroviƒá returned to Serbia in 1816. His return was not seen positively by Milo≈° Obrenoviƒá, the new Serbian leader, due to Petroviƒá's close ties to Karaƒëorƒëe (now exiled) and the fear of mutiny against Obrenoviƒá. He was quickly captured and killed along with Petar Nikolajeviƒá Moler by the Ottomans, at close to 80 years of age. Personal life Petroviƒá was regarded a great patriot and hero. He was physically strong and tall, described as very courageous, and was wounded several times in battles, allegedly having 30 wounds. He married three times, and from the first marriage he had two sons, and from the third, a daughter. Legacy In the Serbian historical drama TV series Vuk Karad≈æiƒá (1987), Radiƒç Petroviƒá was played by Milan Srdoƒç.

He served as the first Vizier of Belgrade (the Sanjak of Smederevo) after crushing the First Serbian Uprising (1804‚Äì1813). Origin Sulejman hailed from Uskoplje, a town near Bugojno in central Bosnia. According to Sulejman's great-grandson, the poet Omer-beg Sulejmanpa≈°iƒá (1870‚Äì1918), the family originated from Mihailo, a Bosnian nobleman that held the fort of Vesela Stra≈æa, then after the Ottoman conquest converted into Islam, becoming Ali Pasha (Ali-pa≈°a). Career Ottomans handing over Smederevo, Belgrade, ≈†abac and U≈æice to the Serbian Revolutionaries under Karaƒëorƒëe in November 1806‚ÄìJune 1807. The First Serbian Uprising broke out in the Sanjak of Smederevo (today central Serbia) in 1804, and echoed in other Serb-inhabited lands in the Ottoman Empire. After the Drobnjak Rebellion broke out in March 1805, and expanded in the eastern Sanjak of Herzegovina (now in Montenegro), the Ottoman government sent Sulejman Pasha in the beginning of October to suppress it. Suleiman Pasha was one of the most courageous and resolute Ottoman commanders at that time. By January 1806, the Drobnjak rebellion was suppressed, and Sulejman Pasha had the rebel leaders punished, and forced the population of Drobnjak and Moraƒça to pay tribute. In March 1806, Suleiman Pasha defeated the Serbian rebel band of Radiƒç Petroviƒá near the Studenica Monastery. He commanded the Ottoman army sent from Bosnia that was decisively defeated at Mi≈°ar by the Serbian rebels in August 1806. After the defeat, he retreated to ≈†abac, but was forced to hand over the town to Karaƒëorƒëe, the leader of the Serbian Uprising, in February 1807. In the Ottoman campaign in Serbia in 1813, Suleiman commanded part of the forces that took Loznica, and also participated in the battle of Ravnje, in which he was wounded, at the end of August. After the Ottoman suppression of the First Serbian Uprising (by October 1813), Suleiman was appointed the Vizier of Belgrade (the Sanjak of Smederevo). The Ottoman atrocities against the Serb population sparked Had≈æi Prodan's Revolt (1814), which was violently suppressed by Suleiman. The Second Serbian Uprising broke out in 1815, and after Sulejman was unable to suppress it, his forces having suffered heavy defeats in the battles of Pale≈æ, ƒåaƒçak and Po≈æarevac, and generally failing in restoring order in the Belgrade Pashalik, he was replaced by Marashli Ali Pasha and transferred to Bosnia.

They are accountable to the Attorney General of British Columbia. BC Liquor Stores currently operate 196 locations across the province. The chain was established in June 1921, following the result of a plebiscite in favour of liquor availability through government liquor stores. Prior to the plebiscite, alcohol had been illegal through the Prohibition Act, introduced on May 23, 1916, with exceptions to sacramental, medicinal or industrial purposes.  History  The interior of the Cloverdale liquor store in alt=A photo of a man behind the counter at a liquor store with shelves stocked with liquor behind him. A Port Coquitlam location featuring the \\"Coldzone\\" branding The interior of a BC Liquor Store, featuring an assortment of beer from Sleeman Breweries.  Prohibition era  The Prohibition Act was introduced by Conservative Premier William Bowser in May 1916. Its implementation into law was subject to a binding referendum question which took place on September 14, 1916. To the question \\"Are you in favour of bringing the B.C. Prohibition Act into force?\\"; 36,490 polled in favour and 27,217 opposed. To accommodate the votes of overseas soldiers, voting continued until December 1916. A royal commission was appointed to analyse the soldiers' votes against double-voting; over half of the soldiers' ballots were disallowed by the commission and prohibition took effect on October 1, 1917 under Harlan Carey Brewster's Liberal government. On October 20, 1920, a plebiscite was held to end prohibition in favour of government control and moderation. The plebiscite passed in favour of ending prohibition 92,095 to 55,448. As of 1920, British Columbia had been the only province in Canada who had voted in favour of government-controlled liquor sales.  Government Liquor Act  On February 23, 1921 the Attorney General of British Columbia had introduced the Government Liquor Act. The act was passed in March of that year, and the first government-run liquor stores were opened on June 15, 1921 ‚Äì the same day the Prohibition Act was repealed. Within the first week of the Government Liquor Act becoming law, 17 stores had been opened; by March 1922 at least one store had been opened in 32 of the 39 provincial electoral districts. The ability to purchase liquor was limited to those who purchased an annual liquor permit for five dollars and who were above 21 years of age. British Columbians were not able to buy liquor by the glass between 1921 and 1924. A 1925 amendment of the Government Liquor Act allowed for the establishment of beer parlours.  Indian List  In 1887, the British Columbia passed an act titled the Habitual Drunkards Act which restricted the ability of certain individuals to conduct business: any sale or contract involving them was considered void. The individuals encompassed by the act could not legally purchase liquor. Indigenous people were automatically placed on the list, preventing them from being able to purchase alcoholic beverages. This list was referred to as the \\"Indian List\\". Some non-indigenous individuals were also added to the list based on misbehaviour after excessive drinking. In 1963, the Liquor Control Board Chairman, Colonel Donald McGugan reported that 4,500‚Äì5,000 British Columbians were on the list. Though the members of the list would change, the total number of persons remained approximately the same. The Habitual Drunkards Act was eventually repealed in 1968.  Privatization  Since 1988, the Government of British Columbia has allowed private retail liquor stores. There was a moratorium in place between 1988 and 2002 which limited the number of new private retail licences that were issued. After the moratorium was lifted, it was observed that between 2002 and 2008 there was a 33% increase in private liquor stores and a 10% decrease in government stores.  Cannabis distribution  On April 13, 2017, the Canadian government announced their plans to legalize cannabis for recreational use nationwide. The federal government left it up to the individual provinces to regulate the distribution network. The Liquor Control Board of Ontario, the province of Ontario's equivalent, has announced plans to open up 150 additional cannabis-only LCBO stores, 40 of those opening on July 1, 2018. The previous BC Liberal government had opposed the idea of selling cannabis in liquor stores. A change in government resulted following the 2017 provincial elections, and the Premier of the New Democratic government, John Horgan, has stated he is strongly in favour of using both liquor stores and pharmacies to dispense cannabis. A public consultation process for cannabis legislation in British Columbia was launched on September 25, 2017, and is ongoing.

There has been ongoing conflict between the residents and the state agency responsible for preserving the environment and developing the ecotourism potential. Location The Fazendinha Environmental Protection Area (APA) is in the municipality of Macap√°, Amap√°. It has an area of . It is on the north shore of the mouth of the Amazon River on the border with the municipality of Santana, from the state capital, Macap√°. The APA lies between the Salvador Diniz highway to the north and the Amazon river to the south, bounded by the Igarap√© Paxicu to the east and the Igarap√© Fortaleza to the west. Environment Average annual temperature is about . The APA is scenically beautiful, has diverse fauna and flora and has potential as a quality ecotourism destination. The main ecosystem is V√°rzea forest, estuarine wetlands that are often flooded. Flora includes a√ßa√≠ palm (Euterpe oleracea), Pentaclethra macroloba, Hevea brasiliensis, Carapa guianensis, lianas, bromeliads and orchids. There is a varied fauna of birds, reptiles and fish. History The area was made the Macapa Forest Park in 1974. The Fazendinha Biological Reserve was created by state decree 020 of 14 December 1984 to fully preserve and protect the ecosystem and natural resources of the area. Law 873 of 31 December 2004 created the APA in the same area, with the objective of reconciling environmental protection with rational and sustainable economic use of natural resources by the local population. Law 873 did not mention the former biological reserve. The APA is part of the Amap√° Biodiversity Corridor, created in 2003. Population The 2004 census recorded 267 families in the APA with a total of 1,332 people in 192 houses. Most are illiterate or poorly educated. The first report by the Amap√° Secretariat of the Environment (SEMA) on the process of occupation, use and degradation of the biological reserve was issued in 1995, updated in 1998, 2003 and 2009. A 2011 thesis said the APA was still the scene of land disputes and conflicts over socio-environmental issues. A study published in 2012 concluded that there was still no well-defined framework for environmental management in the APA.

In addition to her scientific contributions to the study of the atmospheric properties of low mass astronomical bodies, she has become well known for her astronomy-related public outreach projects. She is the co-founder of an astro- centric fashion blog titled the STARtorialist, a host for the public outreach series Astronomy on Tap, a parody video creator, and a current research associate for the American Museum of Natural History in New York City.Hanson, Alex. \\"Astrophysics, Fashion, and DJ Carly Sagan: An Interview with Emily Rice\\", HERpothesis, 20 January 2016. Retrieved on 5 November 2016. She has also served as a public presenter at the Hayden Planetarium in New York.  Education  Rice attended the University of Pittsburgh where she was awarded two B.A. degrees, one in Physics & Astronomy, and the other in German. Following her graduation from the University of Pittsburgh, she then moved to Los Angeles where she completed her M.S. and her Ph.D. at the University of California, Los Angeles. Her master's thesis centered around the characterization of stars within the a young star cluster in the constellation of Aquila. The results of her thesis, which relied upon high-resolution spectra obtained by Lisa Prato, were published in the Astrophysical Journal in 2006 and in the upcoming Handbook of Star Forming Regions. For her Ph.D., Rice investigated the physical properties of brown dwarf atmospheres and current model deficiencies via near-infrared spectra. Once her Ph.D. was completed, she served as a postdoctoral fellow for Rebecca Oppenheimer at the American Museum of Natural History in the Exoplanet Group.  Career  Rice is a current faculty member in the Department of Physics & Astronomy at the College of Staten Island, which is part of the City University of New York. In addition to her role as an Associate Professor, she is also a founding member of the Brown Dwarfs in New York City (BDNYC) research group. Her work primarily focuses on near-infrared spectra to characterize the properties of the lowest mass objects in our galaxy, namely: brown dwarfs, very low-mass stars, and giant exoplanets, as well as investigating stellar and planetary system formation mechanisms. Her work has resulted in over 30 co-authored publications. Rice also co-designed and authored a collection of introductory astronomy labs for use in entry-level astronomy courses entitled Astronomy Labs: A Concept Oriented Approach. She is also well known for her continued involvement with the American Museum of Natural History as a research associate and occasional planetarium presenter at the Hayden Planetarium. In 2015, she was awarded the Henry Wasser Award for Outstanding Scholarship from CUNY Academy for the Humanities and Sciences.  Public outreach  Though she has made tremendous contributions to her field of research, Rice stands out for her successful public outreach activities. She is the co-founder, with Summer Ash of an astronomy-centered fashion blog called the STARtorialist, which boasts the tagline: \\"Where science meets fashion and scientists get fabulous\\". She also dons the moniker DJ Carly Sagan, in honor of the legendary science popularizer Carl Sagan, to organize and host engaging, free-to-the- public science gatherings and presentations at bars in New York City as part of the Astronomy on Tap series.

It is currently headed by president George B. Sassine. It is best known internationally for its work promoting assembly plants in Haiti.  Chronology  In early 1986, during a period of social upheaval, the ADIH called on the government of Jean-Claude Duvalier to exercise \\"tolerance and moderation\\". In 1989, it began lobbying efforts on the issue of textile quotas for Haiti. After the 1991 coup d'√©tat which brought general Raoul C√©dras to power, the association managed escrow accounts for tax collection from foreign corporate entities in Haiti until 1994. In 2004, the association stated that they viewed the second overthrow of Jean-Bertrand Aristide as a positive development. In coordination with Bill Clinton, they successfully lobbied the US government from 2003 to 2006 to ensure that textiles coming from Haiti would no longer be subject to import tariffs. (Cf. HOPE & HELP) In 2009, they opposed the parliamentary vote to raise the minimum wage in Haiti to 200 gourdes an hour. In 2013 the association again lobbied against a minimum wage increase, and argued that strikes would damage the Haitian garment industry. They likewise argued against a minimum wage increase in 2016. More recently, the ADIH met with Jocelerme Privert to discuss the consequences of smuggling.

Biography Cunningham was born in 1823 in Frederick County, Maryland, to James Cunningham, a retired British military captain, and Catherine Campbell, a native of the state. He had three brothers and a sister. Despite being orphaned in 1834, Cunningham obtained an education and married Elizabeth A. Jones (died 1883) in 1849. They had eight children; Kate, Nannie, Mollie, James, Bessie (married John J. Cockrell, the son of Francis Cockrell), George, Nettie, and Charles. Cunningham moved to California in 1849 and to Johnson County, Missouri in 1854. He went to St. Louis, Missouri in 1862 and moved to Little Rock, Arkansas after the end of the American Civil War. He began operating a sawmill in Little Rock and served on the school board there from 1873 until 1877.Goodspeed's History of Pulaski County, Arkansas (1889) A former Democrat, in 1876 Cunningham joined the Greenback Party, and ran as that party's candidate in the 1882 congressional election, coming in second place to Democrat Clifton R. Breckinridge. He ran for Governor of Arkansas as the candidate of the Agricultural Wheel party in 1886, receiving 11.7 percent of the vote. Cunningham joined the newly formed Union Labor Party in 1888. At that year's Union Labor National Convention in May, Illinois State Senator Alson Streeter was unanimously nominated as their candidate for president. The vice presidential ballot saw Samuel Evans of Texas receive 124 votes, T. P. Rynder of Pennsylvania received 44, and Cunningham received 32. After Evans declined the party's nomination, Cunningham became the vice presidential candidate. He waited several weeks before accepting the nomination. The ULP ticket received 146,602 votes (1.3%) but did get 11.4% in Kansas and 6.8% in Arkansas. Cunningham was influential in the forming of the Populist Party in 1891. He was temporary chairman of the May 1891 Populist convention. Cunningham died on April 21, 1895. He is buried in Little Rock at the Oakland- Fraternal Cemetery.

It contains a large amount of debris from a century of abandoned and wrecked ships, destroyed docks, pilings, and other remnants of the area's industrial past. India Point, on the Providence side, was the city's first port, which remained active from 1680 until the Great Depression in the early 20th century. Bold Point, on the East Providence side, was home to a dry dock and other maritime businesses. India Point and Bold Point were later turned into parks. Due to the dangers posed by the debris, as well as the changing character of the cities and increased public recreational use of the parks, a cleanup effort began in 2015 with federal, state, and non-governmental funding. An analysis of the shoal conducted before a cleanup found it to be Rhode Island's largest ship graveyard, with 29 separate vessels having accumulated over the years. The discovery has led marine archaeologists to call for the area's protection as a cultural heritage site. Geography Green Jacket Shoal is a 33-acre area of the Providence River in Providence Harbor. It sits between the Fox Point neighborhood of Providence on the north and northwest and the Riverside section of East Providence to the east and southeast. The Seekonk River, a tidal extension of the Providence River, continues to the northeast, and is flanked by India Point on the north side and Bold Point on the south side. History Providence Dry Dock and Marine Company at Bold Point circa 1910 { \\"type\\": \\"Feature\\", \\"geometry\\": { \\"type\\": \\"Point\\", \\"coordinates\\": [-71.395462, 41.814148] }, \\"properties\\": { \\"title\\": \\"Green Jacket Shoal\\", \\"description\\": \\"\\", \\"marker-size\\": \\"medium\\", \\"marker- color\\": \\"008000\\" } } Green Jacket Shoal has been an important part of the Providence waterfront since the city's first port was established in 1680 at India Point. India Point, on the Providence side, was a busy and prosperous waterfront area, taking its name from its trade connections with the East and West Indies. Its success was in part due to the large trading businesses of John Brown and his partner, John Francis, who set up in Providence in 1787. Brown, the namesake of Brown University, was active in the slave trade. He, his brother, his sons, and others in his family line brought slave ships to Providence as part of the Atlantic triangle trade. In the late 1800s, the steamships that regularly came through the shoal to India Point carried immigrants to Rhode Island from Ireland, Cape Verde, the Azores, and Portugal. Bold Point, on the East Providence side of the shoal, was home to maritime businesses including Providence Dry Dock and Marine Railway Co., which operated two patent slips and the first floating dry dock in Narragansett Bay, used to repair and maintain ships. According to The Providence Journal, from 1884 to 1919, it \\"was the main ship repair facility in Providence. Green Jacket Shoal was its parking lot.\\" Green Jacket Shoal takes its name from the thick, green eelgrass that once grew there. Moses King wrote in 1882 that the dense grass \\"is a source of much annoyance to the extensive shipping interests at [India Point and Bold Point], and efforts are being made to secure its removal.\\" India Point remained profitable into the early 1900s, but began to decline during the Great Depression. It was battered by the 1938 New England hurricane and commerce largely ceased. By the 1940s, it had turned into a scrap yard. In the 1960s and 1970s, Providence underwent a concerted beautification effort, including the transformation of India Point into a park, which opened in 1974. The long period of neglect is still reflected in the condition of the shoal, which has accumulated a century's worth of debris. Remnants of destroyed docks, pilings, two patent slips, the dry dock, shipwrecks, abandoned ships, and other structures stick out of the water in many places around the shoal, owing to many years of natural disasters and economic hardship. As the character of the area moved away from its industrial past, and with increased public use of the water and its surroundings via India Point Park and Bold Point Park, the detritus has come to be a noted source of urban blight and significant safety concern for anyone using the water. In 2001 the New England Division of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers proposed filling in the area to turn it into a salt marsh. Research conducted for the proposal found \\"abundant\\" shellfish, including soft-shell clams, oysters, mussels, and periwinkles in the intertidal areas of the shoal. Years later, when it was identified as a notable ship graveyard, marine archaeologists argued for conservation of the area as a means of preserving cultural history, likening it to the preservation of landmarks and other structures on land. In 2018, the Rhode Island Coastal Resources Management Council created a Marine Protected Area to preserve the shoal, in cooperation with local historical organizations. The designation creates a restricted perimeter and authorizes state and local law enforcement to take measures to ensure the graveyard is protected. Ship graveyard Before a major 2015 cleanup effort, the Rhode Island Sea Grant funded a study of the debris in Green Jacket Shoal. In November 2015, marine archaeologist David Robinson of the University of Rhode Island counted 26 shipwrecks, making it the state's largest ship graveyard. In 2018, he increased the number to 29 wrecks, supplementing his dives with help from local libraries and archives. Two of the ships are well known sidewheeler steamboats from the late 1800s and early 1900s: the Bay Queen and the Mount Hope, passenger boats measuring 182 feet and 193 feet, respectively. The Bay Queen took people around Narragansett Bay, including to attractions like Rocky Point Park and Crescent Park. After running for 37 years from 1865 to 1902, its machinery and upper parts of its hull were removed with the intention of turning it into a barge, but it was later abandoned. The Mount Hope ferried people between Providence, Newport, and Block Island. Other ships in the shoal are more recent, including a barge that is also the most visible wreck in the shoal. While the shoal was shallow enough to be difficult for many ships to travel through, its place in the busy harbor made it an easy place to dump unwanted ships. The shoal was also home to ship maintenance facilities, including the area's main ship repair facility, the Providence Dry Dock and Marine Railway Co., making it easy to recover anything of value before they were discarded. Robinson cites the combination of these conveniences as the primary reason the shoal accumulated so many ships. When the company closed in the early 20th century, the ships were left behind, floating near the coast of Bold Point. The poor quality of the water, increasingly polluted since the middle of the 19th century, and the related lack of marine life, may be responsible for the good condition of the wrecks years later. According to Robinson via The Providence Journal, the graveyard contains six classes of ships: 2 sidewheeler cruise ships, 17 scow barges, 4 sailing ships, 3 harbor steamers, 2 steam/diesel boats, and 1 schooner barge. Robinson describes the graveyard as not junk but \\"an archaeological site of some significance ... the last gasp of the merchant sailing fleet and the use of the bay as a playground for Rhode Islanders.\\" He and marine archaeologist Susan Langley have made a case for preserving the area for its historical and cultural significance. Cleanup Green Jacket Shoal in 2017, viewed from Bold Point Park in East Providence Clean Bays, a non-profit organization based in Middletown, Rhode Island, developed a technique for clearing underwater debris. It is based on the Aqualogger, a ship designed by Maine-based company Deadhead Lumber to recover valuable underwater timber. Clean Bays modified the design by equipping it with an underwater chainsaw which can drop down to cut pieces of wood from larger structures. By chopping up debris into smaller parts, it can be easier to bring them to shore, but importantly, it also does not dig up potentially harmful sediments like using more forceful pulling or dragging methods could. The technique was piloted near Bold Point Park in summer 2014, with a grant from the Schmidt Family Foundation's 11th Hour Racing project. In 2015, Clean Bays removed two old barges from the shoal, and in 2014 and 2015, it received state and federal funding, through the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, to pursue a year-long project to clean up not just Green Jacket Shoal but 350 acres of the Providence River and Seekonk River. For the larger project, the organization modified its own ships to function like the Aqualogger, rather than make arrangements to use it again. Some of the debris with historic value is planned to be left submerged. According to U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, who supported the project, \\"This is kind of an effort at reclaiming the Seekonk River and the northern tip of the Bay from long-gone industrial uses and making them appropriate for the kind of residential and recreational uses that could be a real gift to the cities if it were made a more appealing amenity.\\" ReferencesExternal links * ‚Äì presentation about the cultural significance of Green Jacket Shoal by marine archaeologists David Robinson and Susan Langley Category:Ship graveyards Category:Shoals of the United States Category:Narragansett Bay Category:Geography of Providence, Rhode Island Category:East Providence, Rhode Island Category:Bodies of water of Providence County, Rhode Island ","title":"Green Jacket Shoal"},{"id":"52200559","text":"Books of the Genesis of the Ukrainian people (Title page of 1921 year edition) First page manuscript in two languages (about years 1845-46) The Books of the Genesis of the Ukrainian People (or Divine Law) (, Knyhy Buttia Ukrayinskoho Narodu) is a philosophical and religious treatise attributed to Nikolay Kostomarov,Arkadii Zhukovsky.

The service- power is an expression of God's love for man and his desire to make man as happy as he himself.Books of the Genesis of the Ukrainian people - [42] 40 It originated the idea of equality. The service-power is committed to equality of individuals who are perfect because of their relationship with God. The predominance-power is associated with pride - a nature of Devil, and needs to humiliate the subject of power is arising from necessity to feel self- admiration and of own greatness.Books of the Genesis of the Ukrainian people - 11Kozak S. Between history and messianism –ü—Ä–∞—Ü—ñ –ù–¢–® Volume 224(CCXXIV) - –°.63 This predominance-power originated inequality. Therefore, the power-domination leads to social hierarchy and stratification. Thus the service-power is a progress source for individuals and society and the predominance-power the source of their degradation.

The primary function of the line was to bring coal from the mines to the steel mill, but passenger service also operated to small villages along the line.

Biography  After enrolling at the Academy of Fine Arts, Nuremberg between 1948 and 1949, Pfahler pursued his artistic training at State Academy of Fine Arts in Stuttgart, which he attended until 1954. Although Pfahler had mainly worked in ceramics during his student days, as a freelance artist, he focused increasingly on painting. After his early \\"Metropolitan\\" pictures, Pfahler developed pictorial configurations around 1956, in which he experimented with the spatial effects of color in a manner reminiscent of the pointillist technique used by French Divisionists. This phase gave way to works which, from 1956, were based on Action Painting and Art Informel. In 1956 he founded gruppe 11 (group 11) together with G√ºnther C. Kirchberger. The group had exhibitions in Munich, Brussel, Rome and London in 1957-59. The term \\"formativ\\" (formative), which he added to the titles of his pictures from 1958 on, marked his emancipation as a painter from the more formless style influenced by Willi Baumeister. An intention to clarify new ways of seeing and fresh viewpoints lead to ink drawings, followed by collages. In the upcoming years, he simplified the geometrical forms and ultimately became mere vehicles for colors and their interrelations. In about 1962 block-like forms turned into crisply demarcated color surfaces, which elevate Pfahler to being the sole representative of \\"Hard-Edge Painting\\" in Germany. He achieved his international breakthrough in exhibitions such as \\"Signale\\" 1965 in Basel, \\"Formen der Farbe\\" 1967 in Amsterdam, Stuttgart and Bern or \\"Painting and Sculpture from Europe\\" 1968 in New York City, where he presented the pictures he created in the early 1960s. Given his interest in the spatial properties of color, it is in its nature that in 1965 Pfahler should have begun to really translate his works into the third dimension in his \\"Farb-Raum-Objekte\\" (color space objects) and the 1969 \\"Farbr√§ume\\" (color spaces). Since 1965 realized numerous architectural projects, which have been a substantial contribution towards the development to art in architecture and public spaces in post-war Germany. Amongst Thomas Lenk, Heinz Mack and G√ºnther Uecker, Pfahler was chosen to provide the German pavilion to the Venice Biennale in 1970 and in 1981 he was chosen to represent German art at the Sao Paulo Biennale. After working as a guest lecturer at Helwan University in Cairo in 1981, he taught at the Academy of Fine Arts, Nuremberg in Nuremberg from 1984 to 1992. Since 1982 Pfahler has lectured at the \\"Internationale Sommerakademie f√ºr Bildende Kunst Salzburg\\" in Salzburg. In 1999 he was given the honorable task of designing the conference room of the Council of Elders in the German Reichstag Building.

The game won the 2011 Dare to Be Digital contest and, in 2012, the BAFTA Ones to Watch Award. In 2013, George was named one of BAFTA's Breakthrough Brits. George received a Professional Masters in Game Development from Abertay University in Dundee. She went on to establish a company with her collaborators on Tick Tock Toys, where they developed the game into a full game, which was released in February 2013. In its first week of release, the game garnered over 100,000 downloads. In October 2013, George was named the first ever video game designer in residence at the Victoria and Albert Museum. She was a resident there until March 2014. In April 2014, she returned to Scotland in order to complete her proposed game with Abertay University student collaborators. While a resident, George was tasked with creating a game that was inspired by a piece from the 1500-1900 Britain galleries. She also had to participate in activities involving games, including workshops and ongoing displays of her work. She spent months selecting the subject for her game, and finally decided on the works of William Morris. She specifically selected his 1883 Strawberry Thief pattern as her subject. In 2014, she released the Strawberry Thief game free for iPad. In the game, players control a flying bird around a screen, and said bird colors the pattern. George currently works in Dundee with primary schools, researching creative ideas for sex games and introducing game design to the children.

He served in the First World War, where he became known as the \\"Coconut bomber\\" and went on to become a firefighter during the Blitz and rest of the Second World War. In 1944 he was awarded the British Empire Medal \\"for general duties at New Cross Fire Station\\" and for his part as a founder and pioneer of the discussion and education groups of the fire service. A blue plaque has been erected in his honour in Camberwell, London Borough of Southwark. First World War When the war began, Roberts enlisted in the Trinidad Army and then signed up to the European Service and worked his way from Trinidad to England, where he was placed in the Middlesex Regiment. As a rifleman attached to the Middlesex Regiment, he fought in the battles of Loos, the Somme and in the Dardanelles. He was wounded first at the Battle of Loos, and then in the Battle of the Somme. According to the wartime magazine, Every Week , he distinguished himself by his \\"extraordinary\\" ability to throw bombs back into enemy lines, as he did with coconuts as a child, and became known as the \\"Coconut Bomber\\".Every Week Magazine (1918) The magazine also reported that he was given special leave to return to Trinidad to recruit more volunteers and was able to sign up more than 250 men with his \\"vigorous speeches\\". Standing at 6‚Äô2\\", Roberts earned a reputation in the Great War for throwing bombs back over enemy lines. After the war he settled in London firstly living in Peckham and then Camberwell where Roberts and his family lived for almost 50 years. League of Coloured Peoples Roberts earned a living as an electrician, a trade he‚Äôd learnt in Trinidad, but found himself up against the bigotry that he and the other black people were subjected to in their day-to-day lives, war heroes or not. In response, in 1931, he joined as one of the founder members of the League of Coloured Peoples, the era‚Äôs most influential civil rights organisation and one of the first organisations to take care of the needs of Britain‚Äôs black community, and according to its 1944 minutes was a member of its executive committee \\"almost from the inception\\". World War II fireman When the Second World War broke out, he was too old for combat. Instead he enlisted for the Home Front, saving countless lives in Southwark as a firefighter during the Blitz, having completed his training with the fire service in 1939. In 1943, Roberts was made a section leader and in the King's 1944 Birthday Honours he was awarded the British Empire MedalLondon Gazette, 2 June 1944, page 2680 \\"for general duties at New Cross Fire Station\\" and for his part as a founder and pioneer of the Discussion and Education groups of the fire service throughout the Second World War. Thousands of men and women would turn up to such groups at their local station houses every week in this government-inspired effort at consciousness-raising.

British Legion Portrait of George Arthur Roberts by Norman Hepple c.1931 Roberts was passionate about the plight of his fellow ex-servicemen and campaigned over the years on behalf of The National Federation of Discharged and Demobilised Sailors and Soldiers, going on to found the local branch of the British Legion. He led thousands of ex-servicemen, including those with battle-wounded who were unable to walk, in a march demanding improved rights and higher pensions. Roberts was so well known at the time that he was even painted by the portrait artist, Norman Hepple. After his death in 1970, he became a forgotten figure until interest in the pre-Windrush generation of black migrants began to surface about a decade ago and he is featured in Stephen Bourne‚Äôs book Black Poppies - Britain's Black Community & the Great War , the story of men of the \\"old British Empire\\" who regarded joining the war effort as a matter of honour. Marriage and children In Trinidad, Roberts had two daughters, Violet and Stella, with Delcina Green. After the First World War, George settled at 84 Meeting House Lane in Peckham. On 6 October 1920 he married Margaret Whyland in Camberwell and they moved to 40 Bournemouth Road before settling in the Lewis Trust Dwellings in Warner Road, Camberwell which remained his home until he died in January 1970 at King's College Hospital, London. A fortnight later, on 20 January, Roberts was cremated at Honor Oak Crematorium and his ashes scattered on the New Circular Lawn. Margaret and George had two sons, Cyril and George Victor. Margaret died in 1937 and Roberts then married Rose Barnett in 1941. Blue Plaque Blue Plaque for George Arthur Roberts In September 2016, Roberts was honoured with a blue plaque by the London Borough of Southwark for the first black man to serve in the army and fire brigade. The text of the plaque is \\"George A. Roberts 1890 to 1970 First World War soldier, Second World War fireman, West Indian Community Leader. Lived here 1923 to 1970. Voted by the people\\". The plaque is located on the Lewis Trust Dwellings in Warner Road, Camberwell, London. The scheme was led by the Southwark Heritage Association. At the unveiling firefighters solemnly formed a guard of honour at the ceremony. The ceremony was attended by family, politicians including Harriet Harman and the Mayor of Southwark, and assorted dignitaries, including the Acting High Commissioner of Trinidad and Tobago. Southwark historian Stephen Bourne had featured George in his book Black Poppies - Britain's Black Community and the Great War (The History Press, 2015) and he continued to research his life and career. Stephen then nominated George for the blue plaque. When his nomination was accepted, Stephen led a campaign for George to win. George not only won, but proved to be a popular choice with voters.
