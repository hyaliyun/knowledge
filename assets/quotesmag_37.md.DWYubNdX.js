Located in the southwestern corner of Van Buren Township, the church sat at the intersection of Hoying and Wright- Puthoff Roads in the unincorporated community of St. Patrick. Parish history St. Patrick parish was organized in 1862 among a primarily Irish population. Although the region was settled primarily by German farmers, the members at St. Patrick were generally laborers who had been recruited to participate in the construction of the Miami and Erie Canal through western Shelby County. Starting one year later, the parish was served by priests from the Missionaries of the Precious Blood;Brown, Mary Ann. Ohio Historic Inventory Nomination: St. Patrick Catholic Church.

Accessed 2010-03-09. nearly five miles to the northwest.DeLorme. Ohio Atlas & Gazetteer. 7th ed. Yarmouth: DeLorme, 2004, 55. . The parish built a log church in 1863; it was replaced by a frame church in 1871. Members in the vicinity of McCartyville to the northeast were created a separate parish in 1882, weakening the original parish. Architecture By the 1910s, the old frame building had proved insufficient for the church's needs. Consequently, the parish arranged for the erection of its third and final church, a Flemish bond brick structure constructed in a transitional Italianate style of architecture. This building was based on a foundation of concrete and a gabled tile roof; the rectangular church featured a square bell tower on its southwestern corner. The interior featured frescoes and a prominent statue of Saint Patrick (the patron saint of IrelandWho was Saint Patrick, History Channel, 2008. Accessed 2010-03-09.); it was lit by multiple windows of stained glass. As a large church in a rural setting served by priests of the Society of the Precious Blood, St. Patrick's was closely connected to many other churches in western Ohio: wide areas of western Ohio that were primarily settled by Catholics feature large churches at sparsely-populated crossroads. While most of these churches are constructed in the Gothic Revival style of architecture, some of the newer churches of the region ‚Äî including St. Patrick's ‚Äî appear in a variety of styles; St. Patrick's was one of the few that lacked the high steeples of the Gothic Revival structures. The leading role of these churches in western Shelby County and the lands somewhat farther west has caused the region to be nicknamed the \\"Land of the Cross-Tipped Churches.\\" Other buildings St. Patrick's Church was one of four properties owned by the parish in the community of St. Patrick. Located to the east of the church was the parish cemetery; across Hoying Road to the north was the former parish school, built in 1906; and to the east is the brick rectory. A square two-story structure, the rectory features a hip roof and a stone foundation. The parish built the rectory in 1919 to house its pastor; before its construction, St. Patrick's was served by priests from St. Michael's Church in Fort Loramie to the southwest.Brown, Mary Ann. Ohio Historic Inventory Nomination: St. Patrick Catholic Rectory. Ohio Historical Society, October 1977. Recent history In 1977, the church and rectory were recorded by the Ohio Historic Inventory for the purpose of historic preservation; both buildings were ranked in good condition without any significant risks. Two years later, they were listed together on the National Register of Historic Places, along with over thirty other buildings in the Land of the Cross-Tipped Churches. When these churches were listed, it was feared that some rural churches were ultimately endangered by changing demographics; while all of the other churches remain active parishes, St. Patrick's has closed.

Power Ventures, Inc. is a lawsuit brought by Facebook in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California alleging that Power Ventures Inc., a third-party platform, collected user information from Facebook and displayed it on their own website. Facebook claimed violations of the CAN-SPAM Act, the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (\\"CFAA\\"), and the California Comprehensive Computer Data Access and Fraud Act. According to Facebook, Power Ventures Inc. made copies of Facebook's website during the process of extracting user information. Facebook argued that this process causes both direct and indirect copyright infringement. In addition, Facebook alleged this process constitutes a violation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (\\"DMCA\\"). Finally, Facebook also asserted claims of both state and federal trademark infringement, as well as a claim under California's Unfair Competition Law (\\"UCL\\"). Background Power Ventures previously operated the domain power.com and used it to create a website that enabled its users to aggregate data about themselves that is otherwise spread across various social networking sites and messaging services, including LinkedIn, Twitter, Myspace, and AOL or Yahoo instant messaging. This aggregation method is embodied in its motto: \\"all your friends in just one place\\". Power Ventures wanted to provide a single site for its customers to see all of their friends, to view their status updates or profile pages, and to send messages to multiple friends on multiple sites. Facebook v. Power Ventures: Facebook Terms of Use Against Scraping, LawUpdates.com (Jul. 20, 2009). The litigation focuses on Power Ventures alleged \\"scraping\\" of content for and from users on Facebook into Power Ventures interface. Facebook sued claiming violations of copyright, DMCA, CAN-SPAM, and CFAA.Jason Schultz, Intermediate Copying to Extract Information , Cyberlaw Cases (Aug. 31, 2009). Power Ventures and Facebook tried unsuccessfully to work out a deal that allowed Power Ventures to access Facebook's site, through Facebook Connect. In late December 2008, Power Ventures informed Facebook that it would continue to operate without using Facebook Connect. Power Ventures allegedly continued to \\"scrape\\" Facebook's website, despite technological security measures to block such access. Opinion of the Court Facebook sued Power Ventures Inc. in the Northern District of California. The court's ruling addressed a motion to dismiss the copyright, DMCA, trademark, and UCL claims.  Legal standard  When a court considers a motion to dismiss, it must take the allegations in the Plaintiff's complaint as true and construe the Complaint in a manner that is favorable to the Plaintiff. Thus, for a motion to dismiss to succeed, the complaint must lack either a cognizable legal theory or sufficient facts to support the legal theory.Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 12(b)(6).  Copyright infringement  To state a claim for copyright infringement, a plaintiff need only allege # Ownership of a valid copyright and # Copying of original elements of the work. The First Amended Complaint (\\"FAC\\") alleged that Power Ventures accessed Facebook's website and made unauthorized \\"cache\\" copies of it or created derivative works derived from the Facebook website. However, Power Ventures contended that Facebook's copyright allegations are deficient because it is unclear which portions of Facebook's website are alleged to have been copied. Facebook argued that it need not define the exact contours of the protected material because copyright claims do not require particularized allegations. Since Facebook owns the copyright to any page within its system (including the material located on those pages besides user content, such as graphics, video and sound files), Power Ventures only has to access and copy one page to commit copyright infringement. Facebook conceded that it did not have any proprietary rights in its users' information. Power Ventures users, who own the rights to the information sought, have expressly given them permission to gather this information. Judge Fogel's reasoned that MAI Systems Corp. v. Peak Computer, Inc. and Ticketmaster LLC v. RMG Techs. Inc. indicated that the scraping of a webpage inherently involves the copying of that webpage into a computer's memory in order to extract the underlying information contained therein. Even though this \\"copying\\" is ephemeral and momentary, that it is enough to constitute a \\"copy\\" under ¬ß 106 of the Copyright Act and therefore infringement. Since Facebook's Terms of Service prohibit scraping (and thus, Facebook has not given any license to third parties or users to do so), the copying happens without permission. = MAI Systems Corp. v. Peak Computer, Inc. = In the MAI case, the Court granted summary judgment in favor of MAI on its claims of copyright infringement and issued a permanent injunction against Peak. The alleged copyright violations included: # Peak's running of MAI software licensed to Peak customers; # Peak's use of unlicensed software at its headquarters; and, # Peak's loaning of MAI computers and software to its customers. = Ticketmaster LLC v. RMG Techs. Inc. = In this particular case, the Court held that Ticketmaster LLC (\\"Ticketmaster\\") was likely to prevail on claims of direct and contributory copyright infringement as a result of defendant RMG Technologies Inc. (\\"RMG\\") distribution of a software application that permitted its clients to circumvent Ticketmaster.com‚Äôs CAPTCHA access controls, and use Ticketmaster's copyrighted website in a manner that violated the site's Terms of Use. The Court held that RMG was likely to be found guilty of direct copyright infringement because when RMG viewed the site to create and test its product, it made unauthorized copies of Ticketmaster's site in its computer's RAM. In the instant case, the Court followed Ticketmaster to determine that Power Ventures' 'scraping' made an actionable \\"cache\\" copy of a Facebook profile page each time it accessed a user's profile page.  Digital Millennium Copyright Act  The elements necessary to state a claim under the DMCA are # Ownership of a valid copyright; # Circumvention of a technological measure designed to protect the copyrighted material; # Unauthorized access by third parties; # Infringement because of the circumvention; and # The circumvention was achieved through software that the defendant either ## Designed or produced primarily for circumvention; ## Made available despite only limited commercial significance other than circumvention; or ## Marketed for use in circumvention of the controlling technological measure. Power Ventures argued that Facebook's DMCA claim was insufficient using the same arguments listed above. They also argued that the unauthorized use requirement was not met because the users are controlling the access (via Power Ventures site) to their own content on the Facebook website. However, the Terms of Use negate this argument because users are barred from using automated programs to access the Facebook website. While users may have the copyright rights in their own content, Facebook placed conditions on that access. After Power Ventures informed Facebook that it intended to continue their service without using Facebook Connect, Facebook implemented specific technical measures to block Power Ventures' access. Power Ventures then attempted to circumvent those technological measures. As all of the elements of a DMCA claim had been correctly pleaded and supported in the FAC, the motion to dismiss the DMCA claim was denied.  Trademark infringement  Federal = The Lanham Act imposes liability upon any person who # Uses an infringing mark in interstate commerce, # In connection with the sale or advertising of goods or services, and # Such use is likely to cause confusion or mislead consumers. Facebook stated that they were the registered owner of the FACEBOOK mark since 2004. Furthermore, they alleged that Power Ventures used the mark in connection with Power Ventures business. Facebook never authorized or consented to Power Ventures' use of the mark. Facebook also stated that Power Ventures' unauthorized use of the mark was likely to \\"confuse recipients and lead to the false impression that Facebook is affiliated with, endorses, or sponsors\\" Power Ventures. Power Ventures countered that Facebook was required to provide concise information in the Complaint with respect to the trademark infringement allegations, including information about each instance of such use. However, since particularized pleading is not required for trademark infringement claims, Facebook's allegations were sufficient to survive Power Ventures' motion to dismiss the trademark infringement claim. = State (California) = To state a claim of trademark infringement under California common law, a plaintiff need only allege # Their prior use of the trademark and # The likelihood of the infringing mark being confused with their mark. For the same reasons listed above, the Court also denied Power Ventures' motion to dismiss the state trademark claim.  Unfair Competition Law  California's UCL jurisprudence had previously found Lanham Act claims to be substantially congruent to UCL claims. However, it was unclear as to whether Facebook was relying on it trade dress claims or if it also intended to incorporate other portions of the FAC, such as those dealing with the CAN-SPAM and CFAA claims. In order to promote an efficient docket, the Court granted Power Ventures' motion for a more definite statement. Ruling The district court granted summary judgment to Facebook on all three of the Facebook claims. The district court awarded statutory damages of $3,031,350, compensatory damages, and permanent injunctive relief, and it held that Vachani 1064 *1064 was personally liable for Power's actions. A magistrate judge ordered Power to pay $39,796.73 in costs and fees for a renewed Federal Civil Procedure Rule 30(b)(6) deposition. Power filed a motion for reconsideration, which the district court denied. Defendants timely appeal both the judgment and the discovery sanctions. Appeal Argued and Submitted December 9, 2015 San Francisco, California. Filed July 12, 2016 and Amended December 9, 2016. The appeals court affirmed the district court's holding that Vachani was personally liable for Power's actions. https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15088098698953309455&q;=Facebook,+Inc.+v.+Power+Ventures,+Inc&hl;=en&as;_sdt=2006&as;_vis=1 Vachani was the central figure in Power's promotional scheme. First, Vachani admitted that, during the promotion, he controlled and directed Power's actions. Second, Vachani admitted that the promotion was his idea. It is undisputed, therefore, that Vachani was the guiding spirit and central figure in Power's challenged actions. Accordingly, we affirm the district court's holding on Vachani's personal liability for Power's actions. Discovery Sanctions The court also affirmed discovery sanctions imposed against Power for non-compliance during a Rule 30(b)(6) deposition. Defendants failed to object to discovery sanctions in the district court. Failure to object forfeits Defendants' right to raise the issue on appeal. U.S. Supreme Court On April 24, 2017, Defendant Steven Vachani (\\"Vachani\\") filed a motion to stay all proceedings in the case pending resolution of his petition for certiorari in the United States Supreme Court. However, the Ninth Circuit has held that \\"once a federal circuit court issues a decision, the district courts within that circuit are bound to follow it and have no authority to await a ruling by the Supreme Court before applying the circuit court's decision as binding authority.https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16410946649837001148&q;=Facebook,+Inc.+v.+Power+Ventures,+Inc&hl;=en&as;_sdt=2006&as;_vis=1 Final Ruling On May 2, 2017 the United States District Court, N.D.

It was first produced in 1959 at the Th√©√¢tre de la Renaissance in Paris. It was one of the last plays Sartre wrote, followed only by his adaptation of Euripides' The Trojan Women. The title recalls his formulation \\"Man is condemned to be free.\\" It is the only one of Sartre's fictional works which deals directly with Nazism, and also serves as a critique of the then-ongoing Algerian War.http://people.brandeis.edu/~teuber/sartrebio.html \\"Although concerned explicitly with that conflict and its aftermath, the play was intended to refer also to the Algerian War, then in progress. The play impugns Nazi Germany and the type of men it produced--not just SS soldiers but also members of the upper bourgeoisie who found Nazism useful because it served their economic interests.\\" The action takes place in Altona, a borough of the German city-state of Hamburg.  Synopsis  The play by the Ljubljana City Theatre in 1960 Sartre summarizes the plot in the program notes of the play: \\"A family of big German industrialists, the von Gerlachs, live near Hamburg in an ugly old mansion in the middle of a park. When the curtain rises, the father, who has only six months to live, calls together his daughter Leni, his younger son Werner, and Werner's wife Johanna, in order to inform them of his last wishes. Johanna guesses that, after the father's death, her husband will be sacrificed, as always, to Franz, the elder son. The latter, who has been officially reported dead, has locked himself up, since his return from the front, and refuses to see anyone except his younger sister Leni. In order to save Werner, Johanna determines to investigate the mystery of Franz's seclusion. In doing so, she unwittingly serves her father-in-law's ends. Old von Gerlach makes use of her in order to obtain the interview with Franz which the latter has refused him for thirteen years...\\"  Act One  The play opens in a large sitting-room with Leni, Werner, and Johanna awaiting Father von Gerlach, who has summoned a family meeting. Father arrives and requests that the three take an oath: to remain confined to the house while Werner takes over the family business. Leni swears to obey her father's last wishes, but admits that she does not hold to her oaths. Johanna refuses to be bound to her father-in-law's wishes, and confronts the family's secret: that Franz, the elder son, still lives, and that he has been hidden within the house. She claims that Father merely wants to sacrifice her life and Werner's to Franz's protection as she claims Father has done. When she suggests that the family is perhaps his jailer and well as his prisoner, Leni angrily gives Johanna the key to Franz's room. Johanna goes to the room and knocks, but receives no answer. The use of the key reveals that the door is bolted from the inside. Leni asks whether he is being kept prisoner, and Johanna responds: \\"There are many ways of holding a man prisoner. The best is to get him to imprison himself... by lying to him.\\" The three continue discussing Franz and his motives. Meanwhile, flashbacks are shown involving Franz. The flashbacks reveal Franz's opposition to the Nazis and relate the encounters which forced him to enlist and later to seal himself up. In the first, about seventeen years ago, Franz shelters a rabbi in his room from the Nazis. When he is discovered, Father appeals to Goebbels, who grants Franz amnesty in return for enlistment. The second takes place four years later, after Franz's return from the front and during the Allied occupation of Germany. Leni provokes an American officer, who attacks and attempts to rape her. Franz comes to her protection, and in the struggle Leni strikes the officer with a glass bottle. Franz takes the blame for the incident and is made to be deported. The day before he is to leave, he locks himself in his room. Some time later Father sends Gelber, a family servant, to obtain a forged death certificate. Finally, Werner stands and swears to obey his father's last wishes. Johanna tells Werner that she will leave, who replies he will stay without if necessary, and they both exit. Leni tells her father that she has not told Franz of his condition. He admits he wants Leni to convince Franz to see him before his death so that he can settle his account with him, saying \\"After all, I have lived this life; I don't want it to be wasted,\\" She asks her father why he does not simply give Franz her knocking-signal and see Franz himself, to which he replies \\"I couldn't bear it if he drove me away.\\" The father exits, and Leni knocks on Franz's door, which he opens. Johanna is caught spying by the father. He convinces her to attempt to see Franz herself and asks her to tell Franz that he is going to die, but specifically tells her not to ask Franz to see him. He tells her to see Franz the very next day, saying \\"It is our only chance - yours, his, and mine.\\"  Act Two  The second act takes place in Franz's room, where Leni cleans while waiting for Franz to finish recording a speech to his \\"Crabs\\". The room contains only a desk, a chair, and a bed in terrible shape. The walls are covered in placards with phrases written on them, and a large portrait of Hitler. Franz tells Leni about his crabs - individuals of the early thirtieth century who, he claims, will be able to see every single minute of history through a \\"black window\\". He claims to be the defendant for the twentieth century against the judgment of the thirtieth. Leni tells him that the rest of the family is contriving against him, and that Johanna will come to see him. When she suggests that the door-signal be changed, he refuses, justifying his position by claiming that history is sacred. It is revealed that Leni does in fact lie to Franz, telling him Germany has been left in ruins, and that the two of them occasionally sleep together. He claims that it is not incest, and that he has not desired her. Leni calls him a coward, afraid of words. She repeatedly criticizes how he looks to his crab-witnesses for their judgment of him. Seeming to speak of the crabs, she tells Franz \\"they'll kill you if you don't defend yourself.\\" In his anger, he sends Leni away and tell her he won't let her in should she bring him dinner in the evening. She exits as Franz begins another internal dialogue with his crabs. A flashback is shown where Franz regrets ordering the death of two partisans. He repeats Leni's refrain: \\"I do what I like, and I like what I do!\\", taking responsibility for their death. He then regrets sending Leni away, and when he hears the signal at the door he readily opens it, surprised to find not Leni, but Johanna. Johanna tells Franz that he is tyrannizing them. Franz tells her he does not want their service, but Johanna protests that words alone could not free them. When he asks what will, she answers it would be best if he \\"did away with himself\\", yet she asks him to \\"come back to life\\" - to come out of his seclusion and take over the business so that she and Werner would be free. When he refuses, she accuses him of being a coward. He protests that he will not be judged by her and tells her that he does not have a choice on his position, adding \\"I would not submit myself to it unless it was vitally necessary.\\" He says that he does not want to watch the \\"murder of Germany\\" which Leni tells him is happening, and that he will be the one voice to cry \\"No! Not guilty!\\" to what is imposed on the German people. As Johanna is about to tell Franz something, Leni taps her signal on the door. Franz tells Johanna to hide in the bathroom, and Leni is let in with Franz's dinner. Leni apologizes for the earlier quarrel, but Franz rushes her quickly out of the room. He tells his crabs: \\"Don't be taken in, comrades, Leni cannot lie. (Pointing to the bathroom) The liar is in there. ... Don't worry, I know more than one trick. This evening you will see the downfall of a false witness.\\" He notices his hands are trembling, and contains them only at great effort. A change comes over him: \\"For the first time since the beginning of the scene, he is fully master of himself.\\" He lets Johanna back into the room. Johanna heads for the door, but Franz tells her to wait, as Leni is still just outside. He tells Johanna that she is, like him, a recluse. He makes Johanna realize that he can do something for her that she feels nobody else can do anymore - to make her feel beautiful. When he does this, he convinces her to agree to continue visiting him. He demands that she tell him Germany really is crumbling as Leni says, and she exits.  Act Three  Father catches Leni spying on him as he enters Werner's office. He has just returned from a six- day trip to Leipzig and is waiting for Werner to return from the shipyard. He shuffles Leni out of the room after a few of her questions, and then calls on Johanna. She tells him that she has gone to see Franz every day, and she tells him that telling Franz the truth about Germany's situation would drive him to suicide. When Johanna says that she will leave, Father asks her to go and see Franz one last time and tell him that his father requests an interview. If Franz accepts, Father says he will release Werner from his oath, saving both Werner and Johanna. Johanna refuses, saying that she would not take her freedom at the cost of Franz's death. Werner arrives, and Father leaves, telling Johanna that his proposition still stands. Johanna tells Werner that she has seen Franz, and tells him Father's proposition. She says that Franz would give Father his interview. Werner begins drinking and criticizing Johanna's and Father's motives. He asks Johanna if she has been sleeping with Franz. She says no, and Werner asks Johanna tells Werner that he is only trying to act tough, and says that if they stay, she will see Franz everyday. Werner replies: \\"And you'll spend every night in my bed. (He laughs.) It'll be easy to make the comparison.\\" She exits, telling Werner that she is leaving to make the comparison.  Act Four  The fourth act is in Franz's room. The placards on the walls have been removed, leaving only the portrait of Hitler. The oyster shells have been cleaned from the floor, and Franz appears to be having trouble communicating with his crabs. Johanna arrives and tells him that Father wants to see him. Franz reveals that he knows Johanna is lying to him about Germany. Franz is slowly receding from his solitude - he again keeps track of the time, and is facing the fact of the state of Germany. They discuss the possibility of Johanna sealing herself up as well. Another flashback is shown which takes place in a ruined village on his return from the front. He finds a woman who has lost her legs, who tells him that every German is responsible for Germany's loss. Franz admits that he holds all the guilt of Germany's loss: \\"He who does not do all, does nothing\\", in accordance with the woman's statement that \\"God won't judge you by your deeds, but by what you haven't dared to do - by the crimes that should have been committed and that you didn't commit.\\" Johanna tells him that she acquits him and that she loves him, but Franz says her acquittal must be debated. Leni knocks on the door, and Franz continues: He hides Johanna in the bathroom once again as he admits Leni, who has brought a slice of cake for his birthday and a newspaper. Leni notices lipstick on a champagne glass and reveals that Father has told her Franz has been seeing Johanna. Leni displays a defensiveness, a jealousy of Johanna, claiming that Franz owes her everything. Franz prods Leni to shoot him, but she refuses, telling Franz that she will tell Johanna everything in order to hurt him by shattering Johanna's love for him, and that she is the only one who loves him for who he is. Franz admits there is a one- in-a-hundred chance that Johanna will accept him, adding: \\"Yesterday I would have committed murder. Today I see a gleam of hope. If you're still alive, Leni, it's because I've decided to play this chance to the end\\", and returns the revolver to the drawer. Leni gives Franz the newspaper, a copy of the Frankfurter Zeitung with an article on the Gerlachs, then goes to the bathroom door and tells Johanna to come out. Franz tells Johanna that the time has come to make true on her promise that she would believe only his words, and that their love depends completely on that. He returns to the newspaper, which proves that Germany is truly alive and well. Leni begins to talk about the two prisoners Franz allowed Heinrich to kill, and Johanna comes to the realization that Franz had many people tortured and killed. Johanna tells Leni that she can keep Franz to herself. Franz orders them both out, and when Leni goes towards the drawer which holds the revolver, he yells: \\"Ten past five! Tell father I'll meet him at six o'clock in the conference room. Get out!\\"  Act Five  The final act begins in the large room where the first act took place. It is six o'clock. Franz and Father enter simultaneously. Franz descends the steps slowly as they begin to speak. Franz says that they are both criminals, and that he does not accept Father's ability to judge him, but nonetheless forces him to swear that he will not. He also admits to being a torturer, that he beat the two prisoners to death in trying to make them talk. Franz describes how the powerlessness he felt as the rabbi was beaten to death led him to take full hold of his power later on. He admits \\"I pretended that I was locking myself up so that I shouldn't witness Germany's agony. It's a lie. I wanted my country to die, and I shut myself up so that I shouldn't be a witness to its resurrection.\\" He releases his father from his oath and says that, without there being a God, any man is a person's natural judge. Father admits that he does not accept Franz, but continues: Father reveals that two men of Franz's unit had been taken prisoner by the Russians and survived. They came to see him in 1956, and told Father about the \\"butcher of Smolensk\\". It was from then on that Father had wanted to see Franz, whom he pitied. When they begin to talk about the suffering Franz has created for everyone, Franz climbs back up the stairs and threatens to return to his room. His father tells him that he can no longer hide from Germany's fate. He claims that Germany's loss in the war led to its coming back as a world power, and that those, like Franz, who \\"loved their country enough to sacrifice their military honor for victory\\" merely \\"risked prolonging the massacre and hindering its reconstruction.\\" Father apologizes for trying to mold Franz's life according to his own, admitting that he condemned him to impotence and crime. He tells Franz to \\"Tell your Court of Crabs that I alone am guilty - of everything.\\" Upon hearing this, Franz again descends the stairs, smiling and saying The two discuss taking Leni's Porsche on the Elbe Embankment, a road which leads to the \\"Teufelsbr√ºcke\\" over the Elbe, something they used to do when Franz was young. Father goes to get the car as Franz gives Leni and Johanna his farewells. Leni asks which car and road they are taking, and Franz gives Leni his tape recorder along with his \\"best recording\\" - \\"the case for the defense\\". Franz exits, and Leni, who realizes their intent, tells Johanna \\"[In seven minutes] my Porsche will be in the water... because the Teufelsbr√ºcke is seven minutes from here.\\" Leni says that she will seclude herself in Franz's room, and that she will see only their servant, Hilda. When the seventh minute is reached, she presses the button of the tape recorder, then ascends the stairs and enters the room as it begins to play.  Illustrations of Sartre's philosophy  Throughout the play, Sartre characteristically colors the text of the plot with his philosophic concepts, especially the notions of responsibility and freedom and the contrast between bad faith and authenticity. Some of these comments serve a functional or descriptive role in the plot while simultaneously carrying a philosophic aside. Others are closer to the typical philosophic dialogue, elaborating the characters as they address an issue. In Act One, Father and Werner discuss the power to command others. Here Sartre shows Father's power to stem from a self-deception Werner does not possess: Father claims his ability to command comes from his receiving of orders, despite the fact they are his own. Yet he opposes Werner's proposition, despite its being practically and essentially the same thing: he employs Gelber to employ himself. Similar examples occur in Being and Nothingness, where Sartre shows two groups to be in bad faith for different reasons. The choice of the name Gelber here is a possible pun: Gelb is German for the color \\"yellow\\", which in English can also mean \\"cowardly\\". Also in Act One, Sartre's ideas of freedom and \\"existence precedes essence\\" are illustrated in Johanna's outburst to Father von Gerlach: \\"... I declare that I will not make any confessions for the simple reason that I have none to make. I am alone, with out strength and completely aware of my powerlessness.\\" In the second act, Leni asks Franz why he has not conceded to the crabs every right but the right to condemn him. He claims his exemption as a witness for the defense. Leni objects: \\"Challenge their competence, I beg you; it's your only weakness. Tell them \\"You are not my judges,: and you'll have no one to fear - either in this world or the next.\\" Leni later addresses the crabs directly: \\"...you will condemn us outright, but I couldn't care less.\\" \\"...I forbid [Franz] to plead my cause. I have only one judge - myself - and I acquit myself. Oh, witness for the defense, testify before yourself. You will be invulnerable if you dare to state: \\"I have done what I wanted, and I want what I have done.\\" Later, Franz describes Johanna's beauty as a nothingness to his crabs: Franz's words imply that the crabs cannot see a nothingness, a term Sartre uses to describe value- and structure-/role- judgments which are not inherent to an object's being, but rather given to them by consciousness. Another conversation depicts Sartre's \\"Man is a useless passion\\": \\"Franz (ironic admiration): [A] Star! And you didn't succeed? What did you want?\\" Johanna: \\"What does one want? Everything.\\" F (slowly): \\"Everything, yes. Nothing else. All or nothing.\\" (Laughing) \\"Turned out badly, eh?\\" J: \\"Always does.\\" Sartre considers the possibility that the German soldiers themselves were guilty of enabling Nazi war crimes: \\"[Klages, a German lieutenant] was the champion of mental reservation. He condemned the Nazis in spirit to hide the fact that he was serving them in the flesh... He said to God: \\"I don't like what I'm doing.\\" But he did it.\\" This motif of universal responsibility is repeated by Franz and other characters in different forms throughout the play, notably by the dying woman in the flashback of Act Four.

The village is directly across the harbor from Jerusalem, Rhode Island. Galilee, Rhode Island is named after the Biblical Galilee, which was the original home region of Jesus Christ, who grew up in Nazareth, a village in the Galilee region of Israel on the Sea of Galilee. Four of Jesus' disciples, Andrew, Peter, James and John, were fishermen from Galilee. Today, the port of Galilee is responsible for transporting over 16 million pounds of seafood and shellfish each year. Part of the town of Narragansett, RI (population 15,868 in 2010), Galilee experiences significant seasonal population fluctuation and has been known to double in size in the summer months. As summer brings warmer weather, tourists come from all over to visit various state beaches, relax at private beach clubs, take the ferry to Block Island, and charter boats to go fishing or whale watching. History The village received its name \\"[i]n 1902, the story goes, Thomas Mann a fisherman from Nova Scotia who had settled here, felt the village that had sprung up with its fishing shacks should be called Galilee, after the fishing village of biblical times. One day, an old timer sat on the docks repairing his nets when a stranger called out to him, \\"Where am I\\". The answer was \\"Galilee\\". \\"And what is that?\\" the stranger asked pointing to the other side of the channel. The old timer thought for a minute, nodded his head and replied, \\"must be Jerusalem\\". And so the name of Galilee and Jerusalem have been used since to denote a most picturesque part of Rhode Island.\\" In the nineteenth-century the area had developed as a fishing village, and in the early twentieth century, the State dredged the breachway and constructed stone jetties. Later the Army Corps of Engineers constructed three mile long breakwaters to provide a safe harbor of refuge for ships traveling between New York and Boston if they encountered bad weather. Recently on Saturday, July 11, 2015 a mysterious explosion at Galilee's Salty Brine State Beach injured two people. This explosion was suspected to be caused by a reaction between an abandoned copper cable located under the sand and an unusually large quantity of hydrogen in that location. Local residents described the sound as similar to the explosion of a grenade. One individual was thrown over 10 feet away by the blast, resulting in two fractured ribs among other lesser injuries. On Tuesday, March 14, 2017, a 100-foot tall wind turbine located in Galilee Rhode Island was toppled over by an intense winter storm. Strong winds snapped the turbines supporting metal structure in half. Along with the snow, strong winds, and toppled wind turbine, many of the households in Galilee suffered from a loss of power due to this storm. The turbine was reported to have toppled around 11:00 am. Shortly after, around noon, the town's loss of power followed. Attractions Today Galilee remains home to the largest fishing fleet in Rhode Island with commercial fishermen and lobstermen as well as deep sea fish cruises. Due to the high volume of fishermen, it is often easy to find fresh lobster and fish to purchase off the dock directly from boats, as well as in shops and restaurants. There are over 10 seafood restaurants in the village of Galilee including Champlins, George's of Galilee, Clam Jammers, and Buster Krab's Beach Bar & Grill. George's of Galilee is one of area's central landmarks and has access to the Salty Brine State Beach. This beach, along with Roger Wheeler State Beach and Scarborough State Beach, span the coast of Galilee and are divided up by private beaches, beach clubs, and fishing docks. Kayaking, fishing, and sight-seeing are some of the most common activities to do at the beaches in Galilee, with not only whales but gray seals, harp seals, and hooded seals frequently spotted around the area. Other popular places in the port of Galilee to visit include the 100-foot tall wind turbine, the Point Judith lighthouse, the Penny candy store, and Fisherman's Memorial State Park. In the summer, be on the lookout for multiple beach volleyball tournaments and the South County Junior Volleyball Club, which practices in Galilee. The Block Island Ferry operates out of Galilee, going back and forth over 13 miles between Block Island and Galilee in under an hour.

It offers VoIP telephone and home security services across Canada; DSL and cable Internet in Ontario, Quebec, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta, and British Columbia; and IPTV television service in Ontario, Quebec, Alberta and British Columbia. History VMedia officially launched on March 26, 2013. Following the launch of its IPTV television service in Ontario, the company announced in 2016 that its intention is to expand service to Quebec, Alberta and British Columbia in the future. On May 31, 2016, VMedia formally launched IPTV service in parts of Quebec, and British Columbia and Alberta on June 22, 2016. Services=Television VMedia's IPTV service is a traditional subscription television service bundled with over-the-top content delivered through a proprietary Android-based set- top box branded as \\"VBox\\". Subscription to the television service requires a VMedia internet plan, due to contracts for some networks and other CRTC regulations requiring the content to only be distributed over a managed network. On September 16, 2016, VMedia launched an over-the-top \\"skinny basic\\" television service available via an app for Roku digital media players. The service offers 20 channels, including major Canadian and U.S. broadcast networks and channels, and all in high definition. Unlike the main television service, this version does not require VMedia internet, and is thus available nationwide. Internet VMedia provides DSL and cable Internet services as a competitive local exchange carrier by purchasing wholesale bandwidth from major network providers including Bell, Rogers, Cogeco, Vid√©otron, Shaw Communications, Bell Aliant, and Telus. Telephone VMedia offers VoIP telephone service in two tiers: unlimited Canadian long distance or unlimited \\"World\\" long distance (to 60 countries). Home Security VMedia offers monitored Home Security service in two tiers: Protect or Protect Plus.  Carriage disputes  In September 2016, Bell Media issued a cease and desist order to VMedia over its Roku-based IPTV service, demanding the removal of all of its networks. Canadian copyright law allows \\"retransmitters\\", defined as \\"a person who performs a function comparable to that of a cable retransmission system\\", to redistribute local and distant broadcast stations as part of their services. However, this only applies to IPTV services operating over private networks, because the law's definition of a retransmitter does not apply to services operating on new media platforms that are not regulated by the CRTC. VMedia argued that its permission to redistribute these stations fell under its CRTC licensing as a television provider. Bell argued that the over-the-top service did not fall within this definition, or the formal licensing for the IPTV service offered in conjunction with its internet, and thus is a violation of their copyrights. VMedia representative George Burger disputed Bell's arguments, stating that Canadian copyright law was \\"technologically neutral\\", and that broadcasters were \\"happy to provide that content\\" to similar, U.S.-based services such as Sling TV. However, he also warned that VMedia may not be able to afford litigation on the matter, stating that \\"Bell has untold millions of dollars that it can afford to spend on litigation. We're a startup. We're trying to find our way to profitability.\\" Pending the result of the lawsuit, VMedia removed CTV and CTV Two from the service. On November 22, 2016, the Ontario Superior Court of Justice ruled that VMedia must obtain permission from Bell Media to re-transmit its over-the-air channels on an over-the-top service under current law, but added that \\"If technology has overcome the existing laws and policies, it is open to interested parties to put the issues before the CRTC to try to revise the policies and the definitions\\".  RiverTV  On June 4, 2020, VMedia launched RiverTV, a subscription based over-the-top media service featuring traditional digital linear television channels, in addition to video on demand content. RiverTV is available across Canada. RiverTV is the first multichannel video programming distributor (MVPD) in Canada.

The club competes in the Kenya Cup as well as the Enterprise Cup. The club is based and trains at their ground on Ngong Road, adjacent to the RFUEA Ground, and also has an association football division. History The origin of the present Rugby Section of the Impala Club dates back to 1930 when an old boy of the Prince of Wales School (now Nairobi School), Gregory Comninos, started raising teams of old boys to play regular mid-week matches against the School. These matches proved to be a very popular and the possibility of starting an official club was put forward. A meeting was held at the Prince of Wales School and the Old Cambrians Club was launched. It was decided at this time that the club would wear the Welsh colours as their kit. The club initially prospered however, shortly after the acquisition of their Ngong Road ground in 1949, the club went through extremely tough times, the low-point being the 1953 season when no rugby was played. A decision was made to re-launch the club under the name Impala RFC, with many of the old players and coaching staff staying on. This led to a return in strength of the club, and in 1959 they enjoyed an unbeaten season (though ironically this powerful team were not allowed to enter the Enterprise Cup competition due to vageries in the then qualification process which required them to have finished in the top three of the previous year's Nairobi District Championship). Impala continued to prosper into the Sixties, winning the Enterprise Cup in 1961 & 1965. They won the Enterprise Cup consecutively for four years from 1971 to 1974 and several seven-a-side tournaments during the same period. Between 1980 and 1995 the quality of rugby at Impala went into decline however since then they have returned to take their place as one of the top three rugby clubs in the capital.

After the events described in The China Doll, six AXE agents based in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, have been found mutilated and murdered in a short space of time. Nick Carter (undercover as shady millionaire businessman Robert Milbank) accompanied by fellow agent Rosalind Adler (posing as Milbank‚Äôs mistress, Rosita Montez) are sent to investigate. Carter (as Milbank) uses his apparent wealth and influence to enter the higher social circles in Rio de Janeiro and quickly meets socialite Carla Langley ‚Äì wife of one of the missing agents. Next, posing as American journalist, Michael Nolan, Carter interviews the wife of Joao de Santos, a local investigative reporter, and another of the missing agents. Meanwhile, Agent Adler investigates the background of missing agent Carlos Brenha, assistant curator at a local museum. As a result of their probing, a seedy nightclub quickly becomes the focus of attention. In the club‚Äôs basement, Carter discovers a cache of illegal weapons imported from China. Carter is knocked out and imprisoned in the club basement. The ringleader is revealed to be Carla Langley who is working for communist China to import illegal arms and execute minor spies in the hope that a special agent (i.e. Carter) would be sent to investigate and whom they intend to torture and kill to extract valuable information. Carter is tied to a rack and beaten but manages to escape. Rosalind Adler arrives in the nick of time and overpowers the guards with a non-lethal gas bomb (nicknamed Pepito). Carter executes the club owner and second-in-command (Luis Silveiro) and is about to do the same to Carla Langley when he discovers the gas bomb has rendered her an insane, gibbering wreck. He leaves her screaming in the night.

Kids for Cash  Along with his fellow Luzerne county Judge Mark Ciavarella, Conahan became infamous as a result of the notorious Pennsylvania \\"Kids for cash\\" scandal in 2008. Ronald Belletiere from Florida was sentenced in the 1990s to 4¬Ω years in federal prison in connection with a Hazleton cocaine-trafficking ring. A witness in that case testified that in 1986, then-Magisterial District Judge Conahan called to tip him off that his drug connection was being investigated. Conahan allegedly referred the man to Belletiere as a safer source to obtain drugs. During a sidebar with a judge in that case, the prosecutor described Conahan as an \\"unindicted co-conspirator.\\" That disclosure became public in 1994 eight months after Conahan was sworn in for his first term as a county judge. At a press conference he held to deny the allegation, he blamed the charges on \\"common criminals\\" looking for favorable treatment with prosecutors.Key player in kids-for-cash learns fate Friday, Standard-Speaker, Dave Janoski, September 18, 2011.

After becoming Luzerne county's president judge running under the Democratic party, Conahan used his budgetary discretion to stop funding the county public youth detention facility, agreeing to send juvenile defendants instead to a newly constructed, for-profit facility. He was subsequently accused of agreeing to generate at least $1.3 million per year in receivables that could be billed to taxpayers in exchange for receiving kickbacks from the facility owner. After indictment, he originally pleaded guilty to charges, but later withdrew his plea. His colleague Mark Ciavarella was also indicted on charges of money laundering, fraud and racketeering. Both judges were disbarred following the guilty pleas.http://edition.cnn.com/2009/CRIME/02/23/pennsylvania.corrupt.judges/http://www.pacourts.us/assets/opinions/DisciplinaryBoard/out/26DB2012-Ciavarella,%20Jr..pdf  State Investigation  The Pennsylvania state Judicial Conduct Board had received four complaints about Conahan between 2004 and 2008, but later admitted it failed to investigate any of them, nor had it sought documentation regarding the cases involved.State Failed to Investigate Complaints in Juvenile Court Kickback Scandal, Juvenile Justice Information Exchange, Noah Echols, March 22, 2010.

Sisak, DECEMBER 12, 2009. Retrieved 8 December 2016. An additional investigation into improper sentencing in Luzerne County began early in 2007 resulting from requests for help from several youths that were received by the Philadelphia- based Juvenile Law Center. The Center's attorneys determined that several hundred cases had been tried without the teenaged defendants having received adequate assistance of counsel. In April 2008, the Center petitioned the Pennsylvania Supreme Court seeking relief for alleged violation of the civil rights of those young defendants. The court initially denied the application for relief, then in January 2009 after charges of corruption against the both judges surfaced, it reconsidered in favor of the appellants.  Federal Investigation  The Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Internal Revenue Service also investigated the two judges, although the particular timeline and scope of the confidential investigations by the federal agencies were not disclosed. Part of the investigation concerned issues that had been raised during disciplinary hearings over the conduct of another troubled former Luzerne County judge, Anne H. Lokuta. In November 2006, Lokuta appeared before Pennsylvania's Judicial Conduct Board to respond to charges regarding her using court workers to do her housework, having openly displayed bias against attorneys arguing cases before her, and having publicly humiliated courthouse staff causing those employees mental distress. The board ruled against Lokuta in November 2008, resulting in her removal from the bench. During the course of those disciplinary hearings, Lokuta accused Conahan of bullying behavior, further charging that he was behind a conspiracy to have her removed. Because Lokuta had aided the FBI's investigation into the \\"kids for cash\\" scheme prior to the determination of the disciplinary board, the state Supreme Court stayed the removal order in March 2009 in light of the ongoing corruption investigations. That paused Lokuta's removal and obviated the election that was scheduled for that May to fill the seat her removal would have left vacant. The state Supreme Court decided, 4-1, to uphold Lokuta's removal from the bench in January 2011, making findings that she had indeed received a sufficiently fair trial, regardless of Carnahan's adverse testimony. That court also ordered the expungements of the records of 2,401 of those juveniles who were affected by the judicial misconduct.Former judge Lokuta still off the bench, Citizens Voice, Dave Janoski, January 15, 2011.

During the Lokuta hearing, Conahan testified that there were no out-of-court social relationships amongst the county judges. However, Judge Michael Toole, who was later convicted of case fixing, as well as another county judge, had each stayed at a Florida condo jointly owned by Conahan and Ciavarella. Shortly after his indictment in January 2009, Conahan pleaded guilty. He later withdrew his plea, intending to take the case to trial. Eventually he pleaded guilty once more. On September 23, 2011, he was sentenced to 17.5 years in prison and ordered to pay over $900,000 in fines and restitution.

It also describes the agencies within several states that are responsible for enforcing child support orders. It also discusses several ways in which to calculate interest, once the method is known. Finally, the laws of each state are summarized. Defined Each state in the United States has its own method of determining the amount of interest to be paid on past due child support. In fact, many states may employ their own special terminology when defining past due child support. Some refer to \\"support arrearages\\" or \\"support in arrears.\\" Some refer to \\"back due support.\\" Some describe child support as \\"family support,\\" while for others the term \\"family support\\" will include what is generally known as alimony, maintenance or spousal support. (The terms alimony and maintenance are usually reserved to describe cash payments for a spouse rather than for a child or children of a relationship.) Simple vs. Compound Interest Knowing the percentage amount of interest to be paid is just one of the factors to be used in the actual calculation of interest. States also differ in whether interest is simple interest or whether it can be compounded. And while most states that permit compounding provide for annual compounding, at least one state, Colorado, provides for interest to be compounded monthly. Order in which payments are to be applied Next, there is the often confusing question as to the order in which payments are to be applied. In simple interest situations, the possibilities are (1) apply a payment first to interest, then to principal; (2) apply a payment first to principal, then to interest; (3) apply a payment first to the current month's obligation, then to interest, then to principal. There is fourth payment allocation description in use in some states (e.g. California Code of Civil Procedure Section 695.221, effective January 1, 2009) which calls for payment \\"first to current month, then to principal, then to interest.\\" In fact, however, this method of allocation is mathematically the same as method #2 above - first to principal, then to interest - for the reason the current month's obligation becomes part of the principal immediately upon falling due. Grace periods Some states have added an additional level of complexity to the interest calculation problem by providing what amounts to a front end interest free loan for a period of time after a payment falls due. Presumably, this \\"grace period\\" is given to allow for processing and accounting delays - these being the time taken when a payment is made through the Registry of a Court. Some states allow a 30-day grace period, a 31-day grace period, or a \\"one-month\\" grace period. Thus, a payment made within the grace period is treated as if paid on time. Changes in law over time (old debt, new law) Finally, most states have changed their own rules over the years, such that the rate, the compounding method, the order in which payments are to be allocated and the grace periods are not the same from year to year over the life of a child support obligation. Questions can then arise as to whether last year's unpaid child support (old debt) remains subject to this year's changed rules of calculation. In times of increasing interest rates, should old debt start earning interest at the new higher rate? In times of decreasing rates, should old debt start earning less? Is interest on debt, incurred before compounding was allowed, to be compounded now that compounding becomes the law? No special rules for child support Some states have no special child support rules, electing instead to treat past due child support the same as any other debt situation. .... Child Support Enforcement offices Each state has a Child Support Enforcement agency. In some states this responsibility is undertaken by an agency known as the Department of Social Services, the Department of Human Services, the Department of Health and Human Services or some similar name. Elsewhere the responsibility is with a division of the local District Attorney. A few states have a specialized statewide child support enforcement agency that is a division of the state attorney general's office. .... Use of spreadsheets to calculate interest It is possible, but difficult, to create an Excel spreadsheet to assist in calculation of interest on past due child support. Use of a spreadsheet may be practical, however, if all transactions (obligations due and payment made), regardless of actual dates, are \\"forced\\" to the first day of each month. While obligations often fall due in a uniform amount on the first of each month, that is seldom the case for payments made. In order to use a spreadsheet, it may also be necessary to treat all months as being of equal length (365/12). When all transactions are posted to the first of the month, and all months are presumed to be of equal length, interest computations from month to month can be easily performed with the same replicated formula. Some jurisdictions may allow one to assume that a payment is timely if made during the month it falls due. For such jurisdictions, \\"force dating\\" all irregular payments to the first of the month would have no mathematical effect. For such jurisdictions, the spreadsheet may be a practical solution. Regardless of force dating and equal month presumptions, making a permanent spreadsheet template that could be used in nearly every situation is nearly impossible as the \\"template\\" will need editing in nearly every situation. (e.g. Rows would have to be added or deleted for each particular case.) If all events are dated as of the first of the month, and all months are presumed to be equal, the calculations will almost always favor the one who is late in making payments. Specialized software to calculate interest Several specialized commercial software programs are available to calculate interest on past due or back due child support. These programs overcome the difficulties of using a spreadsheet program such as Excel. Generally, these program are specifically designed for situations with irregular payment histories, irregular rate changes and unusual payment allocation options. For example, in a child support arrears calculation it is often required that a payment be applied first to the current month's obligation, then to interest and then to prior accrued principal. Law applicable to particular states= Alabama  :Judgments for the payment of money, other than costs, if based upon a contract action, bear interest from the day of the cause of action, at the same rate of interest as stated in said contract; all other judgments shall bear interest at the rate of 12 percent per annum, the provisions of Section 8-8-1 to the contrary notwithstanding; provided, that fees allowed a trustee, executor, administrator, or attorney and taxed as a part of the cost of the proceeding shall bear interest at a like rate from the day of entry.Alabama Code 8-8-10 Recent changes to Section 8-8-10, Code of Alabama 1975, changed the rate of interest charged on judgments. As of September 1, 2011, the interest rate charged on past due child support arrears will be 7.5% per year. Child Support arrearage judgments that occurred between November 13, 1981 and August 31, 2011 shall accrue interest at the rate of 12%. Judgments prior to 11/13/81 will continue to accrue interest at the rate of 6%.http://dhr.alabama.gov/news/news_detail.aspx?ID=5536 California :10% simple interest. Payments applied first to current, then to principal, then to accrued interest. No grace period.Code of Civil Procedure Section 695.221, effective January 1, 2009. Colorado :12% compounded monthly. Because interest is compounded, there is no significant accrued interest account. The current month's obligation becomes part of principal immediately when due. Therefore, there is no issue as to the order in which payments are to be applied. All payments are applied to principal, which includes accrued interest because interest has been compounded.

It is the fourth oldest metal truss bridge existing in Australia. The bridge, completed in 1870, replaced an earlier bridge that was built in 1856 and destroyed in 1867 floods. It was designed by Gustavus Alphonse Morrell and built from 1869 to 1870 by P. N. Russell & Co. The bridge structure, except for the deck, is original and in excellent condition and for over 120 years the bridge carried the Great Western Highway over the Macquarie River. In the early 1990s a realignment of the Great Western Highway resulted in the Evans Bridge replacing the Denison Bridge, with the latter converted to pedestrian traffic only. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 1 August 2003, having earlier been listed on the now-defunct Register of the National Estate in 1978. Historical details Despite the growing importance of Bathurst as the principal urban centre over the Blue Mountains, the Macquarie River, which flows past the town on the Sydney side, was not bridged until 1856. After years of local agitation, a long timber bridge with five laminated timber arches was started in 1855 and was opened on 1 January 1856 by the Governor, Sir William Denison. A bullock was roasted on a spit and 3000 people celebrated the new bridge, named after the Governor. This was the last \\"official\\" bridge designed by the Colonial Architect's Department under its brief direction by architect and engineer, William Weaver (1828‚Äì68). It was supervised by his Clerk of Works, WIlliam Downey, during 1855. Eleven days later another bridge over the Macquarie River a kilometre downstream was opened by a local entrepreneur, George Ranken (frequently quoted as Rankin): this bridge was known as the Eglinton Bridge or Rankin's Bridge. The Denison Bridge was washed away by the great flood of 1867 and its debris also destroyed Rankin's Bridge, so after eleven years of having two bridges, Bathurst again found itself with only a ford or a ferry to cross the Macquarie. A narrow temporary wooden bridge was put across near the remains of the Denison Bridge later in 1867, but this was closed for safety reasons in June 1868. The government recognised that a permanent replacement was urgently needed. A new site was chosen 100 metres downstream from the first Denison Bridge and a realignment was made to the road approaches. The new Denison Bridge was designed by Gustavus Alphonse Morrell, Assistant Engineer to the Department of Roads and foundation member of the Engineering Association of NSW. The bridge contract drawings bear Morrell's signature and that of William Christopher Bennett, Commissioner for Roads. The bridge was constructed in 1869 to 1870 by the prominent engineering firm, P. N. Russell & Co at a cost of 18,818 pounds through the NSW Public Works Department. Most of the angle irons and bars were specially rolled for the job at P. N. Russell & Co's Pyrmont Rolling Mills and at Bathurst's two iron foundries of that time, including the nearby Denison Foundry. Only heavy iron plates and bars were imported. The cast-iron cylinders used in the piers were cast at P. N. Russell & Co's foundry in Sydney, mainly using pig-iron from the Fitzroy Iron Works. Like the first bridge, the new one was opened by the Governor of the time, who was now the Earl of Belmore. Denison had left the colony in 1861 for Madras and then to retirement in England, where he died in 1871. But the new bridge, opened in June 1870, was the replacement of the Denison Bridge of 1856 and the name of Denison was retained. Although incorporated in the original design, footways were never built as part of the bridge. A steel footbridge was erected in 1950, on the upstream side, by the Department of Main Roads. In 1964-65: six piles were driven under the timber approach spans, 23 stringers were replaced, 6 round timber girders renewed, longitudinal sheeting replaced and deck bitumen sealed, timber decking replaced by high tensile bolts in three top chord joints, expansion bearings were repaired and one girder replaced. The deck was emulsion-sprayed and grit-covered. Further repairs in 1975-76 cost $11,377. A concrete deck was laid in 1981. In use for over 120 years as a road bridge, its service life was interrupted only for a 9-day repair period in the 1960s. It was superseded by a prestressed concrete bridge upstream and closed to vehicular traffic in the early 1990s and adapted for use as a footbridge. Denison Bridge was an advanced design for its period and a major engineering achievement, it was the maximum span possible with a wrought iron truss span structure. It is the second oldest metal truss bridge in New South Wales after the Prince Alfred Bridge at . The new bridge was designed on the new American Pratt truss type construction style.  Description  This is an early metal truss bridge that carries 6.1 metres of roadway and a footpath. It has nine spans in all, three timber spans of 6.7m then three wrought iron trusses: 34m, 34.5m, 34m and then three again in timber at 6.7m. Total length of the bridge is 474 ft (143.5m). The main spans consist of wrought iron pony trusses of the Pratt type. Support piers consist of timber piles under the approach spans and four pairs of cast iron cylinders 1.83m diameter braced with wrought iron crossed rods. The ten panel Pratt trusses are simply supported and have horizontally positioned I-sections for the upper chords and sloping end diagonals, but flat metal strips for the tension bottom chords and for the tension diagonals. There are metal stringers on metal cross girders, the whole being located at about the mid depth of the main trusses. The piers are twin metal cylinders. The bridge has four lamp standards, two at each end, and in the centre two signs. On an interpretive sign about the river and people swimming there, and the original makers sign stating : \\"DENISON BRIDGE P. N.RUSSELL & Co. BUILDERS - SYDNEY 1870\\" . Beside the bridge and supported off it, are service pipes. It was reported as being in fair to good condition and in need of regular maintenance as at 23 April 2003. First Denison Bridge The first Denison Bridge was a three span laminated bow-string arch British type bridge commenced in January 1855 and completed the following year. It was opened on New Year's Day 1856, and named in honour of the then Governor-General Sir William Denison, who was on a tour of inspection of the Bathurst region. The first bridge lasted only 11 years, until it was destroyed by floods in 1867. The following article of the time provides great detail of the construction and the features of the first Denison Bridge: > The bridge is built of wood, strengthened in parts by iron rods; it has five > arches, so to speak, built upon the suspension principle. The arches at > either end are small, having a span of about fifty feet, while, the > remaining space is divided between the other three arches, the centre one > being apparently somewhat larger than the two others.

The > roadway is formed of wood, not otherwise covered than with a coating of > preparation to resist the action of the weather, mixed with some rough > material to give foothold to the horses passing over. The total length of > the bridge is about, I should say, 400 feet. The whole building is well > defended by strong side rails and balustrades, as well on the outer sides as > on the inner line.

Heritage listing  The Denison Bridge, a three-span wrought iron bridge, is an early metal truss bridge built in 1870. Its advanced design was a major engineering achievement at the time and represents the maximum achievable by truss spans. The bridge is associated with three important colonial engineers: William Christopher Bennett (Commissioner and Engineer for Roads), Gustavus Alphonse Morrell (Assistant Engineer and designer) and Peter Nicol Russell (P N Russell & Co). The bridge is a prominent local landmark which has played an important role in the history of Bathurst and the Central West. It was the fifth oldest metal truss bridge in Australia until recently but is still the second oldest in NSW (after Gundagai 1867). Denison Bridge was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 1 August 2003 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Denison Bridge is of state significance as the fifth oldest metal truss bridge in Australia until recently and the second oldest in NSW (after Gundagai 1867). Further, the bridge is a significant technical accomplishment in the management of compressive and tension forces in metal truss members. Its design and innovative solution to the pressures of compression and tension is of historical significance in demonstrating the development of engineering and truss bridge technology. Completed in 1870, it replaces an earlier bridge that was opened in 1856 and destroyed in 1867. The present bridge is a metal truss bridge and is currently the fourth oldest existing Australian metal trusses, following Hawthorn (1861), Gundagai Road Bridge (1867) and Redesdale (1868). It is the oldest Pratt type truss bridge in NSW and the oldest of four colonial bridges in Bathurst. Its fabrication and erection are important as it used substantial amounts of materials and skills already available in the colony with subsequent economic benefits to the government. It is significant for being in almost continual use throughout its 120-year history as a road bridge which contributed significantly to the social stability and growth of Bathurst, making possible the continuous flow of people and goods between Sydney and the western districts of New South Wales. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The Denison Bridge is of state significance for its associations with three important colonial engineers: the government engineers W. C. Bennett and G. A Morell; and P N Russell, who formed P. N. Russell and Co and was a major benefactor of the University of Sydney. The Denison Bridge is also significant for its association, through its name, with Sir William Denison, Governor of New South Wales 1855-1861. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The Denison Bridge is of state significance for its technical sophistication and innovation. The structure incorporates an innovative and practical solution to the problem of lateral buckling of the compression top chords of each truss, which was years ahead of the theoretical solution and is of historical significance in demonstrating the development of engineering and truss bridge technology. This solution allowed the length of the bridge to approach the structural limit of truss bridge technology. The clean, open arrangement of members and joints made for easy maintenance which contributed greatly to its long service life. Spanning the Macquarie River and Morse and Berry Parks, the Denison Bridge is locally significant as a prominent engineering landmark and enjoys a picturesque setting. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The Denison Bridge has local significance as an engineering landmark. This significance is demonstrated by its inclusion in the Bathurst Heritage Study, the Register of the National Trust, an Historic Engineering Marker plaque from Engineers Australia (formerly IE Aust) in 1994 and the Register of the National Estate. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The Denison Bridge is of state significance as an engineering achievement. Through the distribution of its ironwork the fabric displays the types of forces, compression and tension generated in the members of trusses. It is unlikely to display any archaeological significance in relation to previous occupation due to the riverine environment and unlikely to display any archaeological potential in relation to the earlier bridge. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The Denison Bridge is rare. It is of state significance as the fifth oldest early metal truss bridge in colonial Australia, and second oldest in NSW after Gundagai (built 1867). The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The Denison Bridge is one of a number of early metal truss bridges in colonial Australia and is representative of its type. It is, however, the second oldest in New South Wales (after Gundagai) and is technologically innovative. This bridge was the first American type Pratt truss in NSW.

In contemporary Mexico the term is used for a number of sauces, some quite dissimilar, including black, red / Colorado, yellow, green, almendrado, de olla, huaxmole, guacamole, and pipi√°n. Outside of Mexico, it typically refers to mole poblano. Generally, a mole sauce contains a fruit, chili pepper, nut, and such spices as black pepper, cinnamon, or cumin. A type of green mole known as mole verde is made with pumpkin seeds and green chile. History Woman cooking mole at a small restaurant in San Pedro Atocpan Two states in Mexico claim to be the origin of mole: Puebla and Oaxaca. The best-known moles are native to these two states, but other regions in Mexico also make various types of mole sauces. Moles come in various flavors and ingredients, with chili peppers as the common ingredient. The classic mole version is the variety called mole poblano, which is a dark red or brown sauce served over meat. The dish has become a culinary symbol of Mexico's mestizaje, or mixed indigenous and European heritage, both for the types of ingredients it contains and because of the legends surrounding its origin. A common legend of its creation takes place at the Convent of Santa Clara in Puebla early in the colonial period. Upon hearing that the archbishop was going to visit, the convent nuns panicked because they were poor and had almost nothing to prepare. The nuns prayed and brought together the little bits of what they did have, including chili peppers, spices, day-old bread, nuts, and a little chocolate. They killed an old turkey, cooked it and put the sauce on top; the archbishop loved it. When one of the nuns was asked the name of the dish, she replied, \\"I made a mole.\\" Mole is an archaic word for mix; now this word mostly refers to the dish, and is rarely used to signify other kinds of mixes in Spanish. A similar version of the story says that monk Fray Pascual invented the dish, again to serve the archbishop of Puebla. In this version, spices were knocked over or blown over into pots in which chicken were cooking. Other versions of the story substitute the viceroy of New Spain, such as Juan de Palafox y Mendoza in place of the archbishop. Selling mole mixes at the Feria Nacional del Mole in San Pedro Atocpan Modern mole is a mixture of ingredients from North America, Europe,Africa, and Asia making it one of the first intercontinental dishes created in the Americas. Its base, however, is indigenous. Nahuatl speakers had a preparation they called m≈çlli (), meaning \\"sauce\\", or chƒ´lm≈çlli () for chili sauce.Nahuatl Dictionary. (1997). Wired Humanities Project. University of Oregon. Retrieved August 29, 2012, from link In the book General History of the Things of New Spain, Bernardino de Sahag√∫n says that mollis were used in a number of dishes, including those for fish, game and vegetables. Theories about the origins of mole have supposed that it was something imposed upon the natives or that it was the product of the baroque artistry of Puebla, but there is not enough evidence for definitive answers. While chili pepper sauces existed in pre-Hispanic Mexico, the complicated moles of today did not. They did not contain chocolate, which was ingested as a bitter beverage, and in all of the writings of Sahag√∫n, there is no mention at all of it being used to flavor food. Most likely what occurred was a gradual modification of the original molli sauce, adding more and different ingredients depending on the location. This diversified the resulting sauces into various types. Ingredients that have been added into moles include nuts (such as almonds, peanuts, or pine nuts), seeds (such as sesame seeds, pumpkin seeds, or squash seeds), cilantro, seedless grapes, plantains, garlic, onions, cinnamon, and chocolate. However, most versions do not contain cinnamon. What remained the same was the use of chili peppers, especially ancho, pasilla, mulato and chipotle, and the consistency of the sauce. The true story of how mole developed may never be truly known, as the first recipes did not appear until after the Mexican War of Independence in 1810. The Nahuatl etymology of the name probably indicates a Mesoamerican origin. Preparation and consumption Jars of commercially available mole negro and mole rojo, as sold in Oaxaca, Mexico All mole preparations begin with one or more types of chili pepper. The classic moles of Central Mexico and Oaxaca, such as mole poblano and mole negro, include two or more of the following types of chili pepper: ancho, pasilla, mulato and chipotle. Other ingredients can include black pepper, achiote, guaje (Leucaena leucocephala), cumin, cloves, anise, tomatoes, tomatillos, garlic, sesame seeds, dried fruit, herbs like Piper Auritum or hoja santa (also known as hierba santa), and many other ingredients. Mole poblano has an average of 20 ingredients; mole almendrado has an average of 26, and Oaxacan moles can have over 30. Chocolate, if used, is added at the end of cooking. According to Rick Bayless, the ingredients of mole can be grouped into five distinct classes: chiles, sour (tomatillos), sweet (dried fruits and sugar), spices, and thickeners (nuts and tortillas). The ingredients are roasted and ground into a fine powder or paste. This roasting and grinding process is extremely laborious and takes at least a day to accomplish by hand. Traditionally, this work was shared by several generations of women in the family, but after the arrival of electric mills, it became more common to take the ingredients to be ground. Many families have their own varieties of mole passed down for generations, with their preparation reserved for special events in large batches. Pi√±on mole The resulting powder or paste is mixed with water, or more often broth, and simmered until it is pungent and very thick. It is most often prepared in a cazuela () or a thick heavy clay cauldron and stirred almost constantly to prevent burning. The thickness of the sauce has prompted some, such as Mexican-food authority Patricia Quintana, to claim it is too substantial to be called a sauce. However, like a sauce, it is always served over something and never eaten alone. Mole poblano is most traditionally served with turkey, but it and many others are also served with chicken, pork, or other meats (such as lamb). A number of mole powders and pastes can be prepared ahead of time and sold, such as mole poblano, mole negro, and mole colorado. Many markets in Mexico sell mole pastes and powders in packages or by the kilogram. These mole mixes are heavy with a strong odor, so much so that security agents at the Mexico City airport once admitted that mole can register a positive when they check for explosives. Prepared mole sauce will keep for about three days in the refrigerator and it freezes well. The paste will keep six months in the refrigerator and about a year in the freezer. Leftover sauce is often used for the making of tamales and enchiladas (often called enmoladas) or over eggs at brunch. Varieties=Poblano Chicken with mole poblano Mole poblano is perhaps the best known of all mole varieties. An ancient dish native to the state of Puebla, it has been called the national dish of Mexico, and ranked first as the most typical of Mexican dishes. Mole poblano contains about 20 ingredients, including sugar and cocoa but for practicality and simplicity chocolate is also used, which works to counteract the heat of the chili peppers, but its flavor does not dominate. It helps reinforce the sauce's dark color provided by mulato peppers. This sauce is most often served over turkey, a meat native to Mexico, at weddings, birthdays and baptisms, or at Christmas with romeritos over shrimp cakes. Even though the holiday is not much recognized elsewhere in Mexico, mole is prominent in Puebla on Cinco de Mayo, where it is a major celebration. Oaxaca Oaxaca has been called \\"the land of the seven moles\\". Its large size, mountainous terrain, variety of indigenous peoples, and many microclimates make for numerous regional variations in its food. From this has come moles negro, colorado, amarillo, verde, chichilo, coloradito, and mancha manteles (or tablecloth stainer), all differently colored and flavored, based on the use of distinctive chilis and herbs. The last, a chicken and fruit stew, is questioned by some such as Susan Trilling in her book My Search for the Seventh Mole: A Story with Recipes from Oaxaca, Mexico, whether it is a true mole. In addition, those from Puebla claim this dish as their own. The best known of Oaxaca's moles is mole negro, which is darker than mole poblano, and also includes chocolate, chili peppers, onions, garlic and more. Its distinguishing ingredient is the leaf of the hoja santa. It is the most complex and difficult to make of the sauces. Mole coloradito is also popular, often simplified and sold as an enchilada sauce. Mole verde is always made fresh with herbs native to the region. San Pedro Atocpan San Pedro Atocpan is an agricultural community in the mountains south of Mexico City, but still considered part of Greater Mexico City. Until the mid-20th century it was similar to those surrounding it, growing corn, fava beans and nopales (prickly pear cactus). Electricity and other modern conveniences were slow to arrive, allowing the community to retain more of its traditions longer. In 1940, Father Damian Sartes San Roman came to the parish of San Pedro Atocpan and saw the potential in marketing mole to raise living standards in the area. At that time, only four neighborhoods prepared mole for town festivals: Panchimalco, Ocotitla, Nuztla and Tula, but those who prepared it were generally prominent women in their communities. In the 1940s, one family made the long trek to Mexico City proper to sell some of their mole at the La Merced Market. It was successful, but they brought with them only two kilograms since it was made by hand grinding the ingredients on a metate. The arrival of electricity in the late 1940s made the use of a powered mill possible, and better roads made the trek to the city easier. Some of these mills were bought or financed by Father Sartes, but the mole was still cooked in a clay pot over a wood fire. In the 1970s, he was part of a small group which became a cooperative, which constructed the Las Cazuelas restaurant. This is where the first Mole Exhibition was held in 1978. The care and tradition that went into the moles from there made them popular and made the town famous in the Mexico City area. Today, San Pedro Atocpan produces 60% of the moles consumed in Mexico and 89% of the moles consumed in Mexico City, with a total estimated production of between 28,000 and 30,000 tons each year. Ninety-two percent of the town's population makes a living preparing mole powders and pastes, all in family businesses. Prices for mole run between 80 and 160 pesos per kilogram, depending on the maker and the type. A number of moles are made in the town, but mole almendrado (mole with almonds) is signature to the area. Producers in Atocpan have their own versions of the various types of mole, often keeping recipes strictly secret. The production in the town has become very competitive, especially in quality. Twenty-two brands are permitted to print \\"Made in San Pedro Atocpan\\" on their labels. Other Mole and other dishes simmering in cazuelas in Chalma, Malinalco, Mexico State Various types of mole sauces can be found throughout the center of Mexico toward the south. There is the mole amarillito of the southeast, the mole coloradito of the Valley of Mexico (as opposed to the mole of the same name in Oaxaca), the mole prieto of Tlaxcala, mole ranchero from Morelos, and more. Taxco has a pink version of mole, called mole rosa. The spiciness of this version is very mild. The word guacamole (avocado sauce) is derived from \\"guaca\\" (from ‚Äúaguacate‚Äù or avocado) and the word mole. Pipi√°n is a type of mole which mostly consists of ground squash seeds. It generally contains tomatillos, hoja santa, chili peppers, garlic and onions to give it a green hue. There is also a red version, which combines the squash seeds with peanuts, red jalape√±os or chipotle, and sesame seeds. Like other moles, it is cooked with broth and then served with poultry and pork, or sometimes with fish and vegetables. Mole verde can refer to a number of different sauces that all finished with a green color. Most of these must be made fresh and not from a mix, as they require a number of fresh herbs and other ingredients. Another version comes from Veracruz, where pork is covered in a sauce made from ground peanuts, tomatillos and cilantro, with the last two giving the sauce its green color. While not moles in the classic sense, there are some dishes that use the term in their name. Mole de olla is a stew made from beef and vegetables, which contains guajillo and ancho chiles, as well as a number of other ingredients found in moles. Huatzmole is a mole sauce variation, which is soupy and often served over goat meat (cabrito). In Guatemala, mole is a dessert sauce made from dried chilis, tomatoes and pumpkin seeds. It is often poured over fried plantains, and served with sesame seeds on top. Popularity Restaurant stands at the Mole National Fair in San Pedro Atocpan Mole is one of the most representative dishes of Mexico, especially for major celebrations. Ninety-nine percent of Mexicans have tried at least one type of mole. The dish enjoys its greatest popularity in central and southern Mexico, but simpler versions of mole poblano did make their way north. However, northern versions are far less complex and generally used to make enchiladas. The consumption of mole is strongly associated with celebrations. In Mexico, to say \\"to go to a mole\\" () means to go to a wedding. Mole has a strong flavor, especially the dark ones and is considered to be an acquired taste for most. This has spawned another saying, \\"(estar) en su mero mole\\", which means something like \\"one's cup of tea\\". To promote their regional versions of the sauce, a number of places host festivals dedicated to it. The Feria Nacional del Mole (National Festival of Mole) was begun in 1977 in San Pedro Atocpan, and is held each year in October. It began outside the town, in the small community of Yenhuitlalpan, in May. The four restaurants there decided to take advantage of the festival of the Se√±or de las Misericordias (Lord of the Mercies) to promote their moles. Despite their success, a number in the village did not like that they were using a religious festival for commercial ends, so a separate mole festival was created for October. Today, 37 restaurants and mole producers participate in the event. The most popular variety is the mole almendrado. Originally, the October version of the fair was held in the town proper, but after it became too big, it was moved to prepared fairgrounds outside along the highway. The city of Puebla also holds an annual mole festival, whose proceeds are shared among the Santa Rosa, Santa In√©s and Santa Catarina convents. The world's record for the largest pot of mole was broken at the city's 2005 festival. The pot was 1.4 meters in diameter at the base, 1.9 meters high, with a diameter of 2.5 meters at the top. Four hundred people participated in its preparation, using 800 kilos of mole paste, 2,500 kilos of chicken, 500 kilos of tortillas and 1,600 kilos of broth. The resulting food fed 11,000 people. The women of Santa Mar√≠a Magdalena in Quer√©taro have been locally known for their mole for about 100 years. In 1993, they decided to hold a contest for the best mole. This was the beginning of the Feria del Mole y Tortilla (Mole and Tortilla Festival), which has been held every year since then. It still features a mole cook-off and attracts hundreds of visitors from the state. The community of Coatepec de Morelos in the municipality of Zit√°cuaro, Michoac√°n, holds an annual Feria de Mole in April. Mole has become a popular and widely available prepared food product in the United States. Several brands of mole paste are available in the United States and can be found online. Chicago has an annual mole festival for Mexican immigrants at the Universidad Popular community center. The event is a cooking contest, which had over 40 entries, with the winner taking away US$500.

Invidia (\\"Envy\\") is one of the Seven Deadly Sins in Christian belief. Invidia and magic The material culture and literature of ancient Rome offer numerous examples of rituals and magic spells intended to avert invidia and the evil eye. When a Roman general celebrated a triumph, the Vestal Virgins suspended a fascinus, or phallic effigy, under the chariot to ward off invidia. Envy is the vice most associated with witches and magic. The witch's protruding tongue alludes to Ovid's Invidia who has a poisoned tongue.Ovid, Met 2.768 The witch and Invidia share a significant feature‚Äîthe Evil Eye. The term invidia stems from the Latin invidere, \\"to look too closely\\". One type of the aggressive gaze is the \\"biting eye\\", often associated with envy, and reflects the ancient belief that envy originates from the eyes.On the evil eye, see Hans Peter Broedel, The \\"Malleus Maleficarum\\" and the Construction of Witchcraft: Theology and Popular Belief (Manchester, UK: Manchester University Press, 2003), 23 Ovid feared that a witch who possessed eyes with double pupils would cast a burning fascination over his love affair.Ovid, Amores 1.8.15-16 Fascinare means to bewitch. Catullus in one of his love poemsCatullus: 7.12 jokes nervously about ill wishers who might count the kisses he gives to his beloved and thus be able to \\"fascinate\\" the lovers with an evil, envious spell. A shepherd in one of Vergil's poemsVergil: Eclogues 3.102-103 looks at his lambs, all skin and bones, and concludes, \\"some eye or other is bewitching them [fascinat]\\"‚Äîto which the commentator Servius addsServius, Commentary on Vergil, Eclogues 3.103 \\"[the shepherd] obliquely indicates that he has a handsome flock, since it was worth afflicting with the evil eye [fascinari]\\". Any unusual felicity or success was felt to be subject to the unspecific but powerful force of envy [invidia]. That is why everyone from soldiers to infants to triumphing generals needed a fascinum, a remedy against the evil eye, an antidote, something that would make the evil wisher look away. Invidia as emotion The experience of invidia, as Robert A. Kaster notes,Robert A. Kaster, \\"Invidia and the End of Georgics 1\\" Phoenix 56.3/4 (Autumn - Winter, 2002:275-295); Kaster presents a diagrammatic \\"taxonomy\\" of the behavioral scripts embodying invidia adducing numerous examples in Latin literature to generate a more nuanced apprehension of the meaning. is invariably an unpleasant one, whether feeling invidia or finding oneself its object. Invidia at the thought of another's good may be merely begrudging, Kaster observes, or begrudging and covetous at the same time: \\"I can feel dolor [\\"pain, sorrow, heartache\\"] at seeing your good, just because it is your good, period, or I can feel that way because the good is yours and not mine.\\"Kaster 2002:281 note 9. Such invidia is morally indefensible: compare the Aesop fable \\"The Dog in the Manger\\". But by far the most common usage in Latin of invidia occurs in contexts where the sense of justice has been offended, and pain is experienced at the sight of undeserved wealth, prestige or authority, exercised without shame (pudor); this is the close parallel with Greek nemesis (ŒΩŒ≠ŒºŒµœÉŒπœÇ)Kaster 2002:283ff. Latin literature Invidia is the uneasy emotion denied by the shepherd Melipoeus in Virgil's Eclogue 1.Explored in terms of the language of emotions and applied to a passage in Virgil's Georgics by Robert A. Kaster, \\"Invidia and the End of Georgics 1\\" Phoenix 56.3/4 (Autumn - Winter, 2002:275-295). In Latin, invidia might be the equivalent of two Greek personifications, Nemesis and Phthonus. Invidia might be personified, for strictly literary purposes, as a goddess, a Roman equivalent to Nemesis in Greek mythology, though Nemesis did receive cultus, notably at her sanctuary at Rhamnous, north of Marathon, Greece.Michael B. Hornum, Nemesis, the Roman State and the Games (Brill, 1993), pp. 6, 9‚Äì10. Ovid describes the personification of Invidia at length in the Metamorphoses (2.760-832): > Her face was sickly pale, her whole body lean and wasted, and she squinted > horribly; her teeth were discoloured and decayed, her poisonous breast of a > greenish hue, and her tongue dripped venom. ‚Ä¶ Gnawing at others, and being > gnawed, she was herself her own torment.English translation in Marina > Warner, Monuments and Maidens: The Allegory of the Female Form (University > of California Press, 1985, 2000), p. 299. Invidia by Jacques Callot (1620) draws on a long iconic tradition Allegorical invidia Among Christians, Invidia is one of the Seven Deadly Sins. In the allegorical mythography of the Middle Ages and Renaissance, the three heads of Cerberus sometimes represent three kinds of invidia.Jane Chance, Medieval Mythography: From Roman North Africa to the School of Chartres, A.D. 433‚Äì1177 (University Press of Florida, 1994), p. 412. In Late Gothic and Renaissance iconography, Invidia is personified invariably as a woman. Cesare Ripa's influential Iconologia (Rome, 1603) represented Invidia with a serpent coiled round her breast and biting her heart, \\"to signify her self-devouring bitterness; she also raises one hand to her mouth to show she cares only for herself\\". The representational tradition drew on Latin authors such as Ovid, Horace, and Pliny, as well as Andrea Alciato's emblem book and Jacopo Sannazaro. Alciato portrayed her devouring her own heart in her anguish.Miles Chappell, \\"Cigoli, Galileo, and Invidia\\", The Art Bulletin 57.1 (March 1975:91-98) p. 97, in the context of an allegorical drawing by Ludovico Cigoli. The expression \\"Eat your heart out! may be read as an invitation to invidia. Invidia is the fatal flaw of Iago in Shakespeare's Othello: \\"O you are well tuned now; but I'll set down the pegs that make this music.\\" (Othello II.i).Kaster 2002 illustrates the process of invidia with a number of utterances of Iago, \\"the most fully rounded representative of such scripts\\" (p. 281). Modern usage of the name The name of the Nvidia Corporation comes from Invidia in Roman mythology.Nvidia, How The Company Got Its Name & Its Origins In Roman Mythology (accessed 9 October 2016) Invidia is also the name of one of Final Fantasy XV's many battle themes.

Early life Born in Southampton, England he emigrated to Australia at the age of five. At the age of 20, Neil became the youngest (paid) director in Australia. Johnson's lengthy career includes stints as producer, director, editor, cinematographer, and production manager. Beginning his career as a camera assistant, Neil was obsessed with Science Fiction, and would spend his spare time making short films. His first 40 music videos were made for free before he started earning a living. Main career To date, Johnson has made over 500 music videos for bands like Manowar, U2 and Rhapsody of Fire. He has directed 6 feature films. His first film, Demons In My Head (1997) is reputed to be the world's first digital film. His second film, To Become One (2000) was produced for exactly $2,196, as proof that you do not need money to make a successful film. His third film, Battlespace (2003) was the shot in Arizona and boasted over 500 digital effects, which, at the time, was considered by some to be a major feat before the digital film-making explosion. From 2005-2007, he shot an additional 20 minutes for the first 2 films, re-cut them, updated the effects, re-sized the films up to high definition and renamed the films. Demons In My Head is now called Nephilim and To Become One is called Bipolar Armageddon. In 2008, he made Humanity's End, a film about the last man in the universe being hunted down to extinction by a race of beings known as the Nephilim. In fact, all his films take place in the same universe and all contain Nephilim as characters dominating mankind. These films have won him praise as \\"The Chester Novell Turner of our time\\" for creating such a monumentous sci-fi trilogy using digital film-making techniques which he created in his spare time. In 2009/2010 he made the film Alien Armageddon. It was originally called \\"Battleground Los Angeles\\", but when 2 other films with similar titles were announced, the name was changed. The film continued the story in the Nephilim universe, tying up all the loose ends. It featured actors Claudia Wells, Virginia Hey and Marilyn Ghigliotti. 2011 saw the release of Alien Dawn, a direct take on The War Of The Worlds. The film was set in modern times and showed Los Angeles decimated with Martian tripods, more akin to George Pal than the original H.G. Wells version. Johnson stated in a number of interviews that he would one day do a proper version of The War of the Worlds once the rights became clear in the UK In 2012, Johnson made the film Death Machine in the UK, following the death of his best friend, Philip Burthem. He stated in an interview on the Geekscape podcast that this film was his personal favorite, born out of the pain of his loss. 2012 He made the films Starship: Rising and Starship: Apocalypse. Both films were shot back to back and were shot on Johnson's own studio soundstage, Morphius Studios. The films were shot and produced in 4K resolution. In 2012 he was featured n the Discovery Channel's Television program Stalked. The episode highlighted the problems he had with a stalker, Wendy Feiner, who had stalked him since 2003. It is alleged that she made many death threats against him and when she was finally arrested, she continued the harassment in jail until the day she died of a drug overdose in September 2012.

He was the main songwriter and guitarist of the American rock band Van Halen, which he co- founded in 1972 with his brother, drummer Alex Van Halen, bassist Mark Stone, and singer David Lee Roth. He is regarded as one of the all-time great guitar players in rock history and was well known for popularizing the tapping guitar solo technique, allowing rapid arpeggios to be played with two hands on the fretboard. Early life Born in Amsterdam, Netherlands, Edward Lodewijk van Halen was the son of Jan van Halen and Eugenia van Beers. Jan was a Dutch jazz pianist, clarinetist and saxophonist, and Eugenia was an Indo (Eurasian) from Rangkasbitung on the island of Java in the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia).Kevin Dodds, Edward Van Halen: A Definitive Biography, 2011, p. 2 \\"Thus was born a Eurasian woman in 1914 with the markedly Dutch name of Eugenia van Beers in the Dutch East Indies.\\" The family eventually settled in Nijmegen, Netherlands.Kevin Dodds, Edward Van Halen: A Definitive Biography, 2011, p. 4 Eddie Van Halen and his older brother Alex Van Halen in 2012. The Van Halen brothers were the founding members of Van Halen. In 1962, the Van Halen family moved from the Netherlands to the United States, settling in Pasadena, California. Eddie and his older brother, Alex Van Halen, were naturalized as U.S. citizens. The brothers learned to play the piano as children starting at the age of six.[ AllMusic.org]; accessed December 1, 2017. They commuted from Pasadena to San Pedro to study with an elderly piano teacher, Stasys Kalvaitis. Eddie revealed in an interview that he had never been able to read music; instead, he learned from watching and listening. For example, during recitals of Bach or Mozart, he would improvise. From 1964 through 1967, he won first place in the annual piano competition held at Long Beach City College. His parents wanted the boys to be classical pianists, but Eddie liked rock music much better. Consequently, when Alex began playing the guitar, Eddie bought a drum kit for himself; however, after he heard Alex's performance of the Surfaris' drum solo in the song \\"Wipe Out\\", he gave Alex the drums and began learning how to play the electric guitar. According to him, as a teen, he would often practice while walking around at home with his guitar strapped on or sitting in his room for hours with the door locked. Eddie and his brother formed their first band with three other boys, calling themselves The Broken Combs, performing at lunchtime at Hamilton Elementary School in Pasadena, where he was in the fourth grade. He would later say that this was when he first felt the desire to become a professional musician. Eddie described supergroup Cream's \\"I'm So Glad\\" on the album Goodbye as \\"mind-blowing\\". He once claimed that he had learned almost all of Eric Clapton's solos in the band Cream \\"note for note... I've always said Eric Clapton was my main influence,\\" he said, \\"but Jimmy Page was actually more the way I am, in a reckless-abandon kind of way.\\"Classicvanhalen.com, Guitar World interview (February 1990). Speaking at an event at the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History in 2015, Eddie discussed his life and the American Dream, saying \\"We came here with approximately $50 and a piano, and we didn't speak the language. Now look where we are. If that's not the American dream, what is?\\" Career=Van Halen Eddie Van Halen in 2015 Eddie and his brother Alex formed a band in 1972. Two years later, the band changed its name to \\"Van Halen\\" and, at the same time, became a staple of the Los Angeles music scene while playing at well-known clubs like the Whisky a Go Go. In 1977, Warner Records offered Van Halen a recording contract. Upon its release, the band's album Van Halen reached number 19 on the Billboard pop music charts, becoming one of rock's most commercially successful debuts. It was highly regarded as both a heavy metal and hard rock album. By the early 1980s, Van Halen was one of the most successful rock acts of the time. The album 1984 went five-times Platinum a year after its release. The lead single \\"Jump\\" became the band's first and only number-one pop hit and garnered them a Grammy nomination. The band won the 1992 Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance with Vocals for the album For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge. In 2019, the band ranked 20th on the RIAA list of best-selling artists with 56 million album sales in the United States and more than 80 million worldwide. Additionally, Van Halen charted 13 number-one hits in the history of Billboards Mainstream Rock chart; meanwhile, VH1 ranked the band seventh on a list of the top 100 hard rock artists of all time and, in 2007, Van Halen was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Individually, Eddie received acclaim for his guitar work in the band. Other work Eddie engaged in several projects outside of his eponymous band, including solo work and partnerships with his brother on film soundtracks (such as The Wild Life, Twister, and a pornographic film) as well as musical collaborations with Kiss bassist Gene Simmons, Nicolette Larson, Michael Jackson,Shields, Gerard (April 22, 1983). . Daily Collegian. Brian May, Sammy Hagar, Black Sabbath, Roger Waters, Toto guitarist Steve Lukather, and LL Cool J. In addition, Eddie made cameo appearances in the music video for Frank Sinatra's \\"L.A. Is My Lady\\", an episode of Caf√© Americain starring his then wife Valerie Bertinelli, and an episode of Two and a Half Men. Eddie was also an inventor on three patents related to guitars: a folding prop to support a guitar in a flat position, a tension-adjusting tailpiece, and an ornamental design for a headstock.  Endorsements & branding Guitars= In 1981, Eddie made his first guitar endorsement by launching the 5150 Baretta model with Kramer. This partnership lasted a decade, when in 1991 Eddie moved away from Kramer and joined forces with Ernie Ball / Music Man where they jointly developed the Music Man EVH model guitar - a partnership that lasted until 1995. In 1996 Eddie teamed up with Peavey where they developed the Peavey EVH Wolfgang - this relationship lasted until 2004 when Eddie joined forces with Fender, initially releasing the Edward-endorsed Art Series guitars under Fender's Charvel brand and later developing the EVH brand. =Strings= Eddie's first string endorsement deal happened around 1989 when Ernie Ball launched the 5150 EVH line of guitar strings. The gauge of the strings differed slightly from typical electric guitar strings at the time, which were 9, 11, 16, 24, 32 and 42 (in thousandths of an inch) - the EVH Ernie Ball strings measured 9, 11, 15, 24, 32 and 40. After this endorsement deal ended, guitar strings became part of the Fender EVH line and are now sold as EVH Premium Strings. =Amplifiers= In 1993, Eddie collaborated with Peavey Electronics to develop a series of amplifiers and cabinets, collectively called the 5150 series. in 2004 Peavey and Eddie parted ways and Eddie started a relationship with Fender where they began development of the EVH products and brand. =EVH= In 2007 the first EVH branded amplifiers were produced by Fender, followed shortly after by a limited-edition \\"Frankenstrat\\" inspired guitar. In 2009 they continued to press forward on the guitar front by releasing the Wolfgang-inspired EVH guitar line. The brand has since expanded to include additional guitars and accessories. Style and influence=Tapping Eddie Van Halen using the tapping technique Van Halen's 1978 instrumental solo \\"Eruption\\", which was voted number 2 in Guitar Worlds readers poll of the \\"100 Greatest Guitar Solos\\",About.com, 100 Greatest Guitar Solos; accessed December 1, 2017.Rollingstone.com, 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time showcased a solo technique called tapping, using both left and right hands on the guitar neck. Although he popularized tapping, he did not invent the technique, which had been used by flamenco guitarists for at least a century, as well as the likes of Western virtuosos like Paganini on both violin and guitar. According to MusicRadar, Steve Hackettlead guitarist with Genesis in the 1970sis \\"widely credited with inventing two-handed tapping\\" and was an influence on Van Halen. When asked about this, Hackett said, \\"Eddie and I have never spoken about it, but yes, he has credited me with tapping... Eddie is a fine player, of course, and he's the one who named the technique.\\" George Lynch said in an interview that he and Van Halen saw Harvey Mandel tap at the Starwood in the 1970s. Van Halen named Jimmy Page of Led Zeppelin as an influence, saying in one interview with Guitar World: Until it expired in 2005, Van Halen held a patent for a flip-out support device that attaches to the rear of the electric guitar., Musical instrument support, April 14, 1987, Edward L. Van Halen, inventor. This device enables the user to employ the tapping technique by playing the guitar in a manner similar to the piano with the face of the guitar oriented upward instead of forward. Guitars The \\"Frankenstrat\\" Van Halen used custom equipment throughout his career. His original choice of guitar was a Gibson Les Paul, for which he replaced the original P90 pickup on the bridge with a humbucker in order to sound like Eric Clapton. He is most associated with the Frankenstrat, a custom guitar he built from parts. The maple neck cost $80, while the ash body was bought for $50 as the wood had a knot in it. The tremolo arm was originally taken from a 1958 Fender Stratocaster, and was later replaced with a Floyd Rose arm. The guitar had a single Gibson PAF (patent applied for) bridge pickup from a Gibson ES-335, which he enclosed with paraffin wax to prevent feedback. The Frankenstrat was originally painted black, but was recoated with Schwinn red bicycle paint in 1979. For Van Halen's 2012 tour, and early 2015 television appearances, he used a Wolfgang USA guitar with a black finish and ebony fretboard. For the 2015 tour, he used a white Wolfgang USA guitar designed by Chip Ellis, featuring a custom kill switch. Pickup selection Van Halen used a variety of pickups including 1970s Mighty Mites, which were made by Seymour Duncan and were copies of DiMarzio Super Distortion pickups. Van Halen also used Gibson PAFs, one of which was rewound by Seymour Duncan in 1978. In an interview with Guitar World in 1985, Van Halen stated that his guitar sound style which he called \\"brown sound\\" is \\"...basically a tone, a feeling that I'm always working at ... It comes from the person. If the person doesn't even know what that type of tone I'm talking about is, they can't really work towards it, can they?\\" In an interview with Billboard magazine in June 2015, he stated that with the expression \\"brown sound\\" he actually tried to describe the sound of his brother Alex's snare drum, which he thought \\"...sounds like he‚Äôs beating on a log. It‚Äôs very organic. So it wasn‚Äôt my brown sound. It was Alex's.\\" Personal life Eddie Van Halen and Valerie Bertinelli at the 1993 Emmy Awards In 1980, Van Halen met actress Valerie Bertinelli at a Van Halen concert in Shreveport, Louisiana. They married in California eight months later on April 11, 1981 and had one son, Wolfgang in 1991. In 2005, Bertinelli filed for divorce in Los Angeles after four years of separation. The divorce was finalized in 2007. The following year, Eddie proposed to his girlfriend, Janie Liszewski, an actress and stuntwoman who was Van Halen's publicist at the time. The two married in 2009, at his Studio City estate, with his son Wolfgang and ex-wife Bertinelli in attendance. His brother Alex Van Halen is an ordained minister and he officiated Eddie's wedding in 2009 and his former sister-in-law Valerie Bertinelli's wedding in 2011. Health and death Van Halen struggled with alcoholism and drug abuse. He began smoking and drinking at the age of 12, and he stated that he eventually needed alcohol to function. He entered rehabilitation in 2007, and later shared in an interview that he had been sober since 2008. Suffering from lingering injuries from past, high- risk, acrobatic stage performances and crashes, Van Halen underwent hip replacement surgery in 1999, after his chronic avascular necrosis, with which he was diagnosed in 1995, became unbearable. He began receiving treatment for tongue cancer in 2000. The subsequent surgery removed roughly a third of his tongue. He was declared cancer-free in 2002. He blamed the tongue cancer on his habit of holding guitar picks in his mouth, stating in 2015: \\"I used metal picks ‚Äì they're brass and copper ‚Äì which I always held in my mouth, in the exact place where I got the tongue cancer. ... I mean, I was smoking and doing a lot of drugs and a lot of everything. But at the same time, my lungs are totally clear. This is just my own theory, but the doctors say it's possible.\\" In 2012, Van Halen underwent an emergency surgery for a severe bout of diverticulitis. Recovery time required due to the surgery led to postponement of Van Halen tour dates scheduled in Japan. Van Halen was later hospitalized in 2019 after battling throat cancer over the previous five years, and his ex- wife Valerie Bertinelli also mentioned a battle with lung cancer in an Instagram post shortly after his death. He died from the illness at Saint John's Health Center in Santa Monica, California on October 6, 2020, at the age of 65 surrounded by his wife, Janie; son and Van Halen bassist, Wolfgang; ex-wife Valerie Bertinelli; and brother, Alex; co-founder and drummer of Van Halen. Some of Eddie Van Halen‚Äôs childhood landmarks in Pasadena became memorials where fans could pay their respects to the guitar virtuoso.

He was also a central voice in the inoculation controversy of 1721. He was an uncle of the notable pastor and theologian Jonathan Edwards. His first wife Eunice Mather was a niece of Rev Increase Mather and a cousin of Rev. Cotton Mather and was related to Rev. John Cotton. Early life and education John Williams was born in Roxbury, Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1664. Son of Samuel Williams (1632‚Äì98) and Theoda Park (1637‚Äì1718). His grandfather Robert had immigrated there from England about 1638. John had local schooling. Later he attended Harvard College, where he graduated in 1683. Career Williams was ordained to the ministry in 1688, and settled as the first pastor in Deerfield. The frontier town in western Massachusetts was vulnerable to the attacks of the Native Americans and their French allies from Canada. The local Pocumtuc resisted the colonists' encroachment on their hunting grounds and agricultural land. In the early 18th century, French and English national competition resulted in frequent raids between New England and Canada, with each colonial power allying with various Native American tribes to enlarge their fighting forces. In 1702, with the outbreak of Queen Anne's War, New England colonists had taken prisoner a successful French pirate, Pierre Maisonnat dit Baptiste. To gain his return, the French governor of Canada planned to raid Deerfield, in alliance with the Mohawk of the Iroquois, Abenaki from northeast New England and the Pocumtuc. They intended to capture a prisoner of equal value to exchange. This is now called the Raid on Deerfield. By raiding Deerfield, they captured Williams, prominent in the community, and more than 100 other English settlers.John Williams The Redeemed Captive, 1800 edition. p. 48 On the night of 28 February 1704, approximately 300 French and Indian soldiers took 109 citizens captive, besides killing a total of 56 men, women and children, including two of Williams' children (six-year-old son John Jr., and six-week- old daughter Jerushah) and his African slave Parthena. The raiding party led the Williams and other families on a march over of winter landscape to Canada. En route to Quebec, a Mohawk killed Williams' wife after she fell while trying to cross a creek, along with Frank, another African slave. Others of the most vulnerable older and youngest people died, some at the hands of Indians who judged them unable to go on. Williams remained steadfast and encouraged the other captives with prayer and Scripture along their journey to Quebec. The large party had seven weeks of hard overland travel to reach Fort Chambly. While captive, Williams recorded his impressions of French colonial life in New France; Jesuit missionaries included him at their table for meals, and he was often given comfortable lodgings, including a feather bed. Upon Pierre Maisonnat's release from Boston, Williams was released by Quebec Governor Philippe de Rigaud Vaudreuil and returned to Boston on 21 November 1706, along with about 60 other captives. Among them were four of his children. Williams was forced to leave in Quebec his daughter Eunice, then ten years old, who had been adopted by a Mohawk family in Kahnawake, a Jesuit mission village. She took the place of their child who had died from smallpox. Eunice became thoroughly assimilated, learning the Mohawk language and ways. Because the French colonial government depended on their alliance with the Mohawk, they would not take by force children whom the Indians had adopted. Eunice was baptized as a Catholic and took the name Marguerite in 1710. She was also given a Mohawk name as a child, and as an adult, was given the name Kanenstenhawi. At age 16, Kanenstenhawi married Fran√ßois-Xavier Arosen, a Mohawk man of 25. They had three children together. Williams and his other four children returned to Deerfield. There he resumed his pastoral charge in the latter part of 1706 and lived there until his death in 1729. He made efforts to keep in touch with Eunice and continued to try to persuade her to return to Massachusetts, as did her brother. Williams was a minister of the favored New England Puritans in the same era as Samuel Willard, Increase Mather, Cotton Mather, Edward Taylor, and Solomon Stoddard. He died shortly before the rise of the Great Awakening. He published several sermons, and a narrative of his captivity called The Redeemed Captive (Boston, 1707). Because of his standing in the colony, his account was one of the more well-known of the numerous Indian captivity narratives published during the colonial period. The 19th-century author James Fenimore Cooper drew on Williams' account as inspiration for his novel, The Last of the Mohicans. Inoculation Controversy In 1721 a smallpox epidemic fell hard on Boston. Prominent ministers such as Increase Mather and his son, Cotton Mather advocated the use of inoculations. Rev. Williams emerged as one of their strongest opponents, publishing, with James Franklin (Benjamin's Brother), a treatise against the Mathers entitled Several arguments proving, that inoculating the small pox is not contained in the law of physick, either natural or divine, and therefore unlawful Death Williams died in Deerfield in 1729. It was not until 1741 that Eunice and her husband went to Massachusetts for the first time, persuaded by her brother's efforts to keep in touch. She made two other visits, including an extended one with her children, but lived in Kahnawake for the rest of her life.Demos, John Putnam. The Unredeemed Captive: A Family Story from Early America.

The gallery closed in 2014. Founded by longtime art dealer Ivan Karp after leaving the Leo Castelli gallery in 1969 where he had worked as gallery co-director for nearly 10 years. Karp opened his own gallery called the OK Harris Gallery in SoHo (which at the time was one of the first galleries in the newest gallery district in New York City). Previously located at 465 West Broadway, in the early 1970s it hosted exhibits by emerging artists as well as well known veteran artists. History Ivan C. Karp was a co-director of Leo Castelli Gallery from 1959 to 1969. In 1969 he broke away and founded OK Harris in the SoHo district of Manhattan. Karp chose the fictitious OK Harris name as it \\"sounded like the name of an American riverboat gambler.\\" As the second gallery on West Broadway (following Paula Cooper who had opened in SoHo in 1968) OK Harris was instrumental in the area's development as a center of fine arts. In addition to being at the forefront of the Photorealism movement in 1969, OK Harris was among the first galleries to exhibit the work of Duane Hanson, Deborah Butterfield, Manny Farber, Richard Pettibone, Robert Cottingham, Robert Bechtle, Marilyn Levine, Nancy Rubins, Malcolm Morley, Luis Jiminez, Jake Berthot, Jack Goldstein, Porfirio DiDonna, Al Souza. OK Harris exhibited contemporary art and photography, and on occasion mounted shows of antiques and collectibles. In its capacious 8000 square foot space, it was able to mount up to five one- person shows simultaneously and has multiple such exhibitions in the course of a year. The gallery maintained a complete photographic archive on its exhibitions from the time of its inception, freely available to students and scholars for research. During the early 1970s it hosted exhibits by Alan Vega, some of which were advertised as \\"Punk Music\\" predating the later Punk rock by some years.

Mukesh, Dhanya Mary Varghese, Jagadish and Suraj Venjaramood plays the lead roles in this film.  Plot  Cheriya Kallanum Veliya Policeum tells the story of a mysterious man Sadasivan (Mukesh) who walks into a house at a village called Pancharakkara, knowing that the man of the house Kumaran (Jagadeesh) has committed suicide. Soon he becomes dear to everyone around, and is a big help to Kumaran's widow Soumini (Vidya) who has been left high and dry after her husband's demise. The whole movie has been set around a house, where a death has taken place. Everyone who could probably add to the village scenario is around; starting from the Panchayat President who sneaks around with ulterior motives in mind at midnight, to the comrade, the local tea shop owner, the tailor and the drunkard to name a few. Amidst these several caricatures, most of which serve no definite purpose, one surprisingly stands out. Kuttappan (Kochu Preman), the blind man who hops into a car to show the guests their way is an eye-opener. He is there on almost every scene and there are quite a few occasions when this diminutive man throws in some big surprises at us.

He played a significant role in the Native American uprising known as King Philip's War. Matoonas had originally converted to Christianity and became a Praying Indian. He was even made a constable by the colonists of the Praying Indian village of Pakachoog. However, in 1671 his son was accused of murdering an Englishman named Zachary Smith, and hanged, despite the fact that it was widely known that somebody else was responsible for the crime. After the execution the head of Matoonas' son was placed on display as a warning. Consequently Matoonas was very bitter towards the English although he kept his true feelings hidden until a suitable opportunity would present itself.Bonfanti, pg. 26 When Metacom (King Philip) began organizing an armed movement against the English settlers in New England in 1675, Matoonas willingly joined and convinced other Nipmuc sachems to follow him. In July of that year he led a raid on the town of Mendon, which decided Nipmuc participation in the war on the side of Philip. Mendon was the first colonial settlement in the Massachusetts Bay Colony to be attacked during King Philip's War. Shortly after the raid on Mendon, together with another Nipmuc sachem, Muttawmp, Matoonas successfully ambushed a party of colonial soldiers in what became known as Wheeler's Surprise at Brookfield.Bonfanti, pg. 27 Matoonas was betrayed and turned over to the English in autumn 1676 by another Nipmuc sachem. Most colonial sources list the name of the one who gave betrayed him as \\"Sagamore John\\", or \\"Chief John\\".Drake, pg. 79 Some sources give the original Native American name of this person as Horowaninit,Moynihan, pg. 28 Schultz and Tougias state in their work on the King Philip's War however, that \\"...Muttawmp and Shoshonin, who had delivered Matoonas to the English, likewise fell victim to Waldron's treachery and were executed at Boston.\\"Schultz and Tougias, pg. 69 Matoonas' betrayer either volunteered to execute him personally, or was forced to do so by the colonists, in order to demonstrate his loyalty to the English. Sagamore John was sold into slavery.Cogley, pg. 161 Matoonas' head, like his son's before him, was presented on a pole outside of Boston as a way to terrorize other Indians who supported King Philip. Mattoonas was surrendered by his chief, at Boston, where he was summarily tried and sentenced to death. At the request of the chief, he was shot by one of his own tribe and his body was hung in chains on Boston Common.Mattoonas, who headed the attack on Mendon, was supposed to have been converted to Christianity by Eliot, at Quinsigamond (near Worcester) but the death of a son, who had been executed at Boston, and the persuasions of Philip, induced him to take up arms. He was, not long afterwards, surrendered by his chief, at Boston, where he was summarily tried and sentenced to death. At the request of the chief, he was shot by one of his own tribe and his body was hung in chains on Boston Common. 7 References 7\\\\. p. 462 Works cited *Eric B. Schultz, Michael J.

The springs, called the Fontes Sequanae (\\"The Springs of Sequana\\"), are located in a valley in the Ch√¢tillon Plateau, to the north-west of Dijon in Burgundy, and it was here, in the 2nd or 1st century BC, that a healing shrine was established. The sanctuary was later taken over by the Romans, who built two temples, a colonnaded precinct and other related structures centred on the spring and pool. Many dedications were made to Sequana at her temple, including a large pot inscribed with her name and filled with bronze and silver models of parts of human bodies to be cured by her. Wooden and stone images of limbs, internal organs, heads, and complete bodies were offered to her in the hope of a cure, as well as numerous coins and items of jewellery. Respiratory illnesses and eye diseases were common. Pilgrims were frequently depicted as carrying offerings to the goddess, including money, fruit, or a favorite pet dog or bird. Representations Image of Sequana in a duckboat A bronze statue of a woman, draped in a long gown and with a diadem on her head, is believed to represent Sequana (Deyts p. 74). She stands on a boat, the prow of which is shaped like the head of a duck with a ball in its mouth, representing the playful, sometimes rebellious, nature of the duck familiars under her command. The approximately tall statue is now in the Mus√©e arch√©ologique de Dijon. Inscriptions Eight inscriptions to Sequana are known, all from the Sources of the Seine. The following are typical (CIL 13, 02858): :Au(gusto) sac(rum) d(eae) Sequan(ae) e[x] / moni[tu] and (CIL 13, 02862): :Aug(usto) sac(rum) / d(e)ae Seq(uanae) / Fl(avius) Flav(i)n(us) / pro sal(ute) / Fl(avi) Luna(ris) / nep(otis) sui / ex voto / v(otum) s(olvit) l(ibens) m(erito)/ San(tos) Mi(chaelle) Some inscriptions contain spelling errors that may give a clue to the pronunciation of Sequana in Gaulish (CIL 13, 02863): :Aug(usto) sac(rum) d<e=O>a(e?) / <p=B>ro(!) / Se<q=C>uan(ae) / pro(!) / C(aius) M[3] / v(otum) s(olvit) l(ibens) m(erito) As Gaulish is in the P-Celtic classification, q cannot represent the Indo-European kw. Something like Sek-ooana is more likely, unless the local dialect was Q-Celtic (which is not impossible).

Some of these videos belong to Veoh's content partners, such as CBS. In these instances, Veoh has permission to display the works. However, Veoh has also received a number of takedown notices related to allegedly copyrighted material posted to the company's site. Veoh asserts that it has received notice for roughly seven percent of the videos that have been uploaded. Video upload process Before users are allowed to upload videos to veoh.com, they are required to register with the website.District Court opinion, page 5. As part of this process, they are required to submit a username, password, and email address. When the user selects a video to upload, Veoh also prompts them to add: a title and description; keywords or tags; applicable content categories; and content rating. Once Veoh receives the file, its systems confirm that it is a video file with a compatible codec. It also extracts any metadata associated with the file and stores all the information related to the file in its database.District Court opinion, page 6. Since users are permitted to submit the video files in a variety of formats, Veoh uses third-party software to automatically convert each of the videos into the Flash format.District Court opinion, page 6-7. In addition to the Flash conversion, Veoh also automatically extracts thirty-two \\"screencaps\\" of the video. Sixteen of these screencaps contain the same resolution as the video itself. These screencaps are not available for users to view or access. The other sixteen screencaps are of a lower-resolution. One of these will be displayed in the user's search results while the entire set will be displayed to the end user to assist them in deciding if they would like to download or watch the movie file.District Court opinion, page 8. Veoh's terms When a user registers with veoh.com, and before they are allowed to upload any content, they must agree to abide by the Veoh's Terms of Use such that: > any User Material that you make available to the Veoh Service may be made > freely available by Veoh through the Veoh Service, including without > limitation for download by other users, and that this permission is made and > granted in consideration of your use of the Veoh Service and is > nonexclusive, perpetual, royalty-free, irrevocable and transferable. . . . > Veoh shall have no obligation to monitor any User Material. However, Veoh > and its agents shall have and do reserve the right to monitor any User > Material from time to time for any lawful purpose. Veoh may, without notice > to you, remove or block content of any User Material from the Veoh Service, > including disabling access to such User material that you have downloaded > through the Veoh Service. Veoh reserves the right to terminate your use of > the Veoh Service if we determine that you have violated these Terms or the > Acceptable Use Policy.

Accordingly, you may > not publish or make available any User Material that constitutes an > infringement of third party intellectual property rights, including rights > granted by U.S. copyright law, or that otherwise violates the Acceptable Use > Policy. You represent and warrant that you have all rights necessary to > publish and distribute any User Material made available by you through the > Veoh Service and that such User Material conforms to the Acceptable Use > Policy. You agree to indemnify and hold Veoh harmless from and against any > liability, claims, losses, demands or damages arising out of or relating to > your violation of these Terms or the Acceptable Use Policy.

Veoh also had an Acceptable Use policy that stated: > Veoh respects the rights of copyright owners to control commercial uses of > their material, and expects our users to do the same. You are responsible > for complying with all federal and state laws applicable to the content > available through the Veoh Services, including copyright laws. Accordingly, > Veoh reserves the right to terminate the service account of anyone who it > learns is using the Veoh Services in violation of copyright law. Veoh has since updated its Terms of Use policy and created a separate Copyright policy. Users were reminded of its terms during the upload process. Upon the first notice Veoh receives that a user has uploaded infringing content, Veoh terminates that user's account, disables all content uploaded by that user, and blocks that user's email address to prevent them from creating a new account. Additionally, Veoh creates a digital fingerprint of the infringing file to detect other copies of it on Veoh's servers and to prevent the same file from being uploaded at a later date. Veoh's employees will also perform spot checks of newly uploaded videos on occasion to check for compliance with its policies. During these checks, employees check to make sure the proper rating has been assigned to movies containing sexually explicit material or reveals obvious copyright infringement. If a movie is found to be in violation of its policies, Veoh disables access to it. Lawsuit IO Group is one of the copyright holders that had their copyrighted films uploaded to Veoh without their permission.District Court opinion, page 3. IO Group noticed that ten of its films were available on veoh.com in varying lengths from six seconds to around forty minutes. Instead of notifying Veoh with a takedown notice after IO Group had initially discovered the clips, IO Group filed a lawsuit on June 23, 2006. IO alleged Copyright Infringement, Contributory Copyright Infringement, and Vicarious Copyright Infringement. at page 9. Around this same point in time, Veoh had independently determined that it would no longer allow adult content on its site. The District Court's Ruling=Legal Standard The issue was before the court on a cross motion for summary judgment. Ordinarily, a court would evaluate whether the defendant was guilty of infringement before evaluating whether the DMCA Safe Harbor provisions apply. However, the Court decided it was \\"appropriate and more efficient\\" to begin by addressing whether Veoh was eligible for protection under ¬ß 512(c).District Court opinion, page 10. See also DMCA Safe HarborsThreshold Requirements= In order for Veoh to be eligible for one of the Safe Harbors, it needs to satisfy the following thresholds: # It must be a service provider.17 U.S.C. ¬ß 512(k) (2006). # It must adopt, inform, and reasonably implement a policy that terminates the account of repeat infringers on the service provider's system17 U.S.C. ¬ß 512(i)(1)(A) (2006). # It must accommodate, and not interfere with, standard technical measures utilized by copyright owners to identify their works.17 U.S.C. ¬ß 512(i)(1)(B) (2006). In this case, IO did not dispute that Veoh was a service provider. Nor did IO dispute that Veoh adopted and informed its end users of a policy regarding repeat infringers. Finally, IO did not assert that Veoh tried to interfere with any of IO's standard technical measures.District Court opinion, page 12. IO did dispute that Veoh's application of its infringer policy was reasonable and asserted that it was a triable issue vitiating Veoh's motion for summary judgement. While the DMCA does not explicitly define what reasonably implemented means, the Court was able to look to the binding precedent set by the Ninth Circuit in Perfect 10, Inc. v. CCBill LLC, 488 F.3d 1102 (9th 2007). In that case, the Ninth Circuit defined Reasonable to mean \\"if, under 'appropriate circumstances,' the service provider terminates users who repeatedly or blatantly infringe copyright.\\"District Court opinion, page 13 (citing Perfect 10, Inc. v. CCBill LLC, 488 F.3d at 1109). The Court found that Veoh had put forth evidence of a working notification system that adequately addressed infringement notices because Veoh had identified a designated Copyright Agent to receive notifications of claimed infringement; Veoh had generated and utilized digital fingerprints; Veoh terminated user accounts after a single warning; Veoh disabled all content uploaded by the infringing user; Veoh blocked the infringing user's email address from opening a different account; Veoh had terminated 1,096 users under its repeat infringer provision; and Veoh had often responded to takedown notices on either the day it was received or shortly thereafter.District Court opinion, page 13. IO wasn't convinced. They believed that Veoh's policy came up short because it did not prevent terminated users from re-registering with a different e-mail address.District Court opinion, page 14. IO argued that Veoh should be held to a standard where they track users by their actual names or their IP Address. The Court did not agree and also noted that IO did not present any evidence that indicated that blocking users through the use of actual names or IP addresses would be any more reasonable than using the user's e-mail address. (The opinion mentions Wikipedia in FN8 as the source for information pertaining to the operation of IP addresses.) Nor was IO able to present any evidence that an actual repeat infringer had created a new account. Instead, the Court pointed out that the DMCA provisions only require that the service provider terminate the account of a repeat infringer when appropriate. The crutch to this provision centers on the service provider's requirement that it knows of the infringement. Were courts to extend that duty beyond the text, it would hinder the policies of Congress. Indeed, another United States District Court had previously found that \\"the DMCA requires reasonable, not perfect, policies....\\"District Court opinion, page 15 (citing Corbis Corp. v. Amazon.com, Inc., 351 F. Supp. 2d 1090, 1104 (W.D. Wa. 2004)). As such, Veoh's policy of tracking infringing content was enough to satisfy the initial threshold requirement. =17 U.S.C. ¬ß 512(c)= After passing the threshold requirements, the Court turned to ¬ß 512(c)'s provision that prevents service provider liability where copyright infringement occurs as a result of the storage of the infringing material residing on the service providers system or network at the direction of a user.17 U.S.C. ¬ß 512(c)(1) (2006). IO argued that because Veoh was creating a Flash version of the content, along with screencaps, when it was uploaded, this infringing copy was not placed on Veoh's server \\"at the direction of a user.\\"District Court opinion, page 18. IO believed that the DMCA policies were not best served by protecting the creation of infringing copies for the purposes of distribution when the only protected activity should have been storage. The Court pointed out that the language of the DMCA does not ever limit the activities to mere storage. Instead, the DMCA splits service provider into two definitions. The narrower definition is used by ¬ß 512(a) and expressly notes that the service provider may not modify the content it receives or transmits.17 U.S.C. ¬ß 512(k)(1)(A) (2006). The broader definition, and the one that applies to Veoh, does not contain this narrowing characteristic.17 U.S.C. ¬ß 512(k)(1)(B) (2006). The Court also noted that another court had also noted that \\"gateway\\" functions, like the one present in this case, should not act as a bar to the Safe Harbor.CoStar Group, Inc. v. LoopNet, Inc., 164 F. Supp. 2d 688 (D. Md. 2001). Thus, the Court concluded that Veoh was not disqualified from ¬ß 512(c)'s Safe Harbor due to its automated process in response to user-submitted material.District Court opinion, page 20. =Red Flag Test= Under the Red Flag test, a service provider may lose their Safe Harbor eligibility if the Court finds that it failed to take action when the infringing activity is apparent due to the service provider's awareness of certain facts or circumstances.District Court opinion, page 21. While IO argued that its copyright registrations in the works provided constructive criticism, the Court found that none of the videos in question contained copyright notices in them. While one of them contained IO's trademark several minutes into the clip, it didn't rise to a level of awareness to impute knowledge of infringement. =Safe Harbor Exceptions= A service provider that has otherwise met the criteria of ¬ß 512(c) can still lose its protections where it meets the common law elements of vicarious liability: * receives a financial benefit directly attributable to the infringing activity AND * has the right and ability to control the infringing activity17 U.S.C. ¬ß 512(c)(1)(B) (2006); CCBill, 488 F.3d at 1117. As to the control element, the defendant would need \\"both a legal right to stop or limit the directly infringing conduct, as well as the practical ability to do so.\\"District Court opinion, page 24 (citing Perfect 10, Inc. v. Amazon.com, Inc. at 1173). While Veoh had created policies governing its systems, the pertinent question focuses on control of the infringing activity.District Court opinion, page 24-25. Additionally, in the context of the internet, the control elements extends beyond the ability of merely deleting the content from the service provider's server because it would be inconsistent to require an act that would also eliminate the Safe Harbor at the same time.District Court opinion, page 25. Instead, something more is required beyond the ability to remove or block access.District Court opinion, page 27. For Veoh to be charged with the duty to exercise the requisite control, they would need to prescreen every file before publishing it. And even assuming for the sake of argument that Veoh had the capacity to review the hundreds of thousands of videos, there is no guarantee that they would be able to distinguish infringing material from non-infringing.District Court opinion, page 28. Even IO had difficulties identifying the videos it owned rights to as it dropped one title and added three more to its list of infringing works during the course of discovery.District Court opinion, page 28-29. =Other= The Court also touched on the below issues, but felt they were not directly related to the issue before it. * Flag It Feature ** The Court did not believe that Veoh's removal of the option to report possible copyright infringement from its flagging function was convincing because it contained a link where Veoh provided users with instructions to submit a takedown notice.District Court opinion, page 23. * Sexually Explicit Nature of the Works ** The Court did not find IO's argument credible whereby they argued that the video clip lacked the requisite labeling requirements of 18 U.S.C. ¬ß 2257, and thus, Veoh should have known that no legitimate producer would have omitted the warning. However, the question of whether the federal labeling law has been violated is irrelevant to the question of whether the service provider had knowledge of the copyright infringement.District Court opinion, page 22. * Reliance on Wikipedia ** Aside from the Court's main holding, the case is also noteworthy for the Court's reliance on Wikipedia in the decision. In two separate instances, the Court took judicial notice of the Wikipedia definitions of internet-related terminology -- \\"Flash Files\\" and \\"IP Address\\". The Court's use of Wikipedia is part of a growing trend in Courts throughout the country. Outcome The Court granted Veoh's motion for summary judgment. As such, it was unnecessary for the Court to decide IO's summary judgment motion. Additional Commentary This case and its progeny has already garnered the interests of a number of authors, which will most likely increase as technology advances. For instance, one author has suggested that the Court may have come to a different conclusion if the practical limitations of identifying infringing content through the use of simple text searches. Thus, once technology evolves to the point where it becomes feasible to search the video content itself, the IO Court may come to a different conclusion. Other authors look more favorable upon the decision, like Professor Edward Lee who praised the Court's IO decision noting that it did a great job in attempting to \\"interpret the DMCA safe harbors in a way that makes the Internet workable.\\" There is even disagreement as to the Court's approach to analyzing both the statute and the case as some felt the Court did not properly apply the DMCA. For instance, one author felt the Court overlapped the elements of vicarious liability and contributory liability in its analysis. However, Professor Eric Goldman calls it \\"a clean and thorough opinion . . . [that] makes a significant contribution to the precedent and teaches us a lot.\\" Looking to the future, this case represents a preview of the stage set for the much larger battle in Viacom v. YouTube. Indeed, Viacom actually intervened in the Veoh litigation and asked the court's permission to file an amicus curiae brief. However, that motion was denied.  See also  *UMG v.

Nayarambalam from a story by Arun Kudamaloor. The plot revolves around the bust of a mysterious man named Junior Mandrake, which apparently brings misfortune to whoever in possession of the artifact. It stars Jagadish, Jagathy Sreekumar, Rajan P. Dev and Janardhanan. The music for the film was provided by the Berny-Ignatius duo. In 2010, a sequel titled Senior Mandrake was released.  Plot  Nambiar is a building contractor, an atheist. However, he is plagued by many a problem in his contracting business, particularly due to the conspiracies plotted by his competitor, Shankara Pillai. Compelled by his wife Sudharma, who is devoted to God, and his children Pradeep and Sandeep, Nambiar consents to consult an astrologer Thanku Panikkar to find if there is any supernatural cause behind their problems. Panikkar ascertains that there is an evil spirit residing in the bust of \\"Junior Mandrake\\" kept in their house. Actually, Nambiar had been entrusted to handover this bust to someone in the airport when he returned from Singapore, but no one had showed up to receive it. Panikkar prescribes the evil spirit can be got rid of only by presenting the bust to someone who may receive it \\"with pleasure\\", who in turn will be taken over by the evil spirit. Nambiar manages to present this bust to his adversary, Pillai, on his birthday party. Panikkar is apparently proven right as the misfortune of Nambiar is now shifted to Pillai, also turning Nambiar into an ardent believer in God in the process. Pillai comes to know about this soon and tries to get rid of the bust by several ways and finally manages to gift it to Patti Menon, the father-in-law of Nambiar. The bust makes various journeys back and forth, finally ending up with Omanakuttan, driver of Menon. Omanakuttan accidentally discovers that there is a bundle of precious stones hidden inside the bust. He takes some stones with him, and keeps the rest over the roof of his rented house. By the time he came back as a wealthy man the house had been rented out by the owner as a police station. Omanakuttan tries to retrieve the remaining treasure from the roof by various means, several of these failed attempts prompts the police to believe that Omanakuttan is insane, he is forcefully confined in a mental hospital. At the same time, the actual owner of the bust, Junior Mandrake, a crime boss in whose shape the bust was made, who was so far in jail in Singapore, is now out searching for it. Mandrake tracks down all those involved with the bust‚ÄîPillai, Nambiar, Pradeep and Sandeep, Menon, and Omanakuttan. He plants a bomb on a moving school van as a decoy to keep the police station with less cops, but Pradeep manages to detach the bomb and saves the children. Mandrake ends up in police custody in his attempt to recover the treasure from the police station, and the treasure goes to the government.

Areobindus was placed as joint commander with Sergius, but the two generals did not agree, with predictably disastrous results for the Byzantine imperial effort: the imperial forces were severely defeated at Thacia, although they managed to kill the rebel Stotzas. Following this, Sergius was relieved and Areobindus was installed in his stead... Soon, however, (March 546) he was murdered in a military mutiny led by Guntharic, the dux Numidiae. Praejecta and her sister-in-law had been sent to safety to a fortified monastery in Carthage, but when Guntharic took over the city, they were removed from there. Guntharic, who probably intended to marry Praejecta, kept her under house arrest but treated her well.. After Guntharic's assassination by the Armenian Artabanes in May and the restoration of Byzantine imperial rule, Praejecta rewarded him with a large sum of money and became engaged to him. Once she was back at Constantinople, Artabanes followed, but Empress Theodora discovered that he was already married and forbade the union.. Artabanes was enraged by this affair, and it contributed to his involvement in the failed conspiracy to overthrow Emperor Justinian in late 548.cf. ; . Praejecta was instead married off to John, son of Pompeius and grandson of Hypatius, a marriage which took place sometime in 546‚Äì548..

Bunner was a lawsuit that was filed by the DVD Copy Control Association (\\"DVD CCA\\") in California, accusing Andrew Bunner and several others of misappropriation of trade secrets under California's implementation of the Uniform Trade Secrets Act. The case went through several rounds of appeals and was last heard and decided in February 2004 by the California Court of Appeal for the Sixth District. DVD CCA's alleged trade secret was its \\"content scramble system\\" (CSS). The case was first heard in the Superior Court of California in Santa Clara County. The court initially found CSS to be a reasonably guarded trade secret and that its trade secret status should not be destroyed simply because it was posted on the Internet. The preliminary injunction was granted to the plaintiff on January 20, 2000. The defendants appealed to the California Court of Appeal, claiming that the lower court's decision unnecessarily restrained Bunner's First Amendment free speech rights. The Appellate Court agreed with Bunner, which led to a further appeal by DVD CCA to the Supreme Court of California. The Supreme Court of California held that although dissemination of computer code is protected free speech, the First Amendment does not prohibit courts from enjoining speech to protect a legitimate property right. It found that the preliminary injunction did not violate the free speech clauses and remanded for the Appellate Court to \\"make an independent examination of the entire record\\" to determine whether there was misappropriation of trade secret. Finally, on February 27, 2004, the California Court of Appeal for the Sixth District concluded that the CSS technology had lost its trade secret status. Therefore, the preliminary injunction burdened more speech than necessary. The granting of the preliminary injunction was therefore reversed. Background DeCSS is a computer program capable of decrypting content on a DVD video disc, essentially circumventing CSS. It was originally written to enable Linux systems to play DVDs, and it uses encryption keys that were obtained by reverse engineering existing DVD players. It was posted on a website by Jon Johansen, one of the original authors, and both the source code and the binary image of the program spread quickly, in part due to an article by Slashdot. Andrew Bunner and many others became aware of this program and reposted a copies of DeCSS on the Internet. After discovering these posts, DVD CCA sent notices to these websites and their service providers demanding the removal of the DeCSS program. The website owners and their service providers did not comply. DVD CCA filed suit against Bunner and others collectively, accusing them of misappropriation of trade secrets and seeking an injunction to prevent them from using or distributing DeCSS or from linking to other websites that disclosed DeCSS. Trial court decision The Santa Clara Superior Court granted the preliminary injunction to stop distribution of the DeCSS program and the keys or algorithms of CSS, but did not prohibit the defendants from linking to other websites containing relevant information or using DeCSS explicitly. The court found that CSS was a trade secret that has been well guarded for three years prior to the disclosure of DeCSS, and it was obtained through reverse engineering which was expressly disallowed by the licensing terms of the CSS. In addition, the Court held that further dissemination of the CSS keys and the DeCSS software would lead to irreparable injury to the plaintiff, whereas the impact to remove the software posed minimal impact to the defendants. Free speech Both the California Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court of California reviewed this case on the First Amendment grounds. The central issue was whether the injunction violated Bunner's right to free speech assuming DVD CCA likely had a valid trade secret claim. The two courts expressed different opinions. The Court of Appeal held that the injunction violated Bunner's free speech rights under the First Amendment and reversed the Superior Court's injunction.DVD Copy Control Assn., Inc. v. Bunner , 93 Cal. App. 4th 648, 113 Cal. Rptr. 2d 338, 60 U.S.P.Q.2d 1803 (Cal. Ct. App. 2001). According to the Court of Appeal, DeCSS was \\"pure speech\\", and the injunction was an invalid prior restraint on pure speech. The Supreme Court of California overturned that decision.DVD Copy Control Assn., Inc. v Bunner , 31 Cal. 4th 864, 4 Cal. Rptr. 3d 69, 75 P.3d 1, 68 U.S.P.Q.2d 1385 (Cal. 2003). It recognized that computer programs are subject to Free Speech protection. However, in this case, the restrictions placed by the injunction were \\"content neutral\\", and were necessary to serve a \\"significant government interest\\" (protecting a trade secret). Additionally, CSS was not a subject of public concern and therefore are not subjected to stricter scrutiny. Based on all these findings, the Supreme Court of California remanded for the Court of Appeal to reevaluate the validity of the trade secret claims to decide whether the injunction should be granted or not. Thus, the narrow question before the Supreme Court of California was whether the preliminary injunction violated Bunner's right to free speech under the United States and California Constitutions even though DVD CCA was presumed likely to prevail on its trade secret claim against Bunner. Validity of the alleged trade secret Under California‚Äôs version of the UTSA, a trade secret consists of \\"information, including a formula, pattern, compilation, program, device, method, technique, or process, that: (1) Derives independent economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to the public or to other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use; and (2) Is the subject of efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy\\". Trade secret misappropriation occurs when somebody does one of the following: * Acquires another's trade secret with knowledge or reason to know \\"that the trade secret was acquired by improper means\\" * Discloses or uses, without consent, another's trade secret that the person \\"used improper means to acquire knowledge of\\" * Discloses or uses, without consent, another's trade secret that the person, \\"at the time of disclosure or use, knew or had reason to know, that his or her knowledge of the trade secret\\" satisfied any of the following conditions: ** Derived from or through a person who had utilized improper means to acquire it ** Acquired under circumstances giving rise to a duty to maintain its secrecy or limit its use ** Derived from or through a person who owed a duty to the person seeking relief to maintain its secrecy or limit its use * Discloses or uses, without consent, another's trade secret that the person, \\"before a material change of his or her position, knew or had reason to know that it was a trade secret and that knowledge of it had been acquired by accident or mistake\\". The Court of Appeal reevaluated the case solely based on trade secret claims, and ruled for Bunner again.DVD Copy Control Assn., Inc. v. Bunner , 116 Cal. App. 4th 241, 10 Cal. Rptr. 3d 185, 69 U.S.P.Q.2d 1907 (Cal. Ct. App. 2004). It decided that by the time the case was filed, CSS has lost its trade secret status, because it was widely circulated on the Internet. In sum, the DVD CCA had failed to establish that the information Bunner republished was still secret at the time he republished it on his website. The trial court's view of this case was colored by the content of the information that DeCSS is designed to circumvent the encryption of DVDs. But the fact that the information at issue was being used for decrypting purposes was not significant from the standpoint of trade secret law. Reactions The Electronic Frontier Foundation, which was \\"thrilled\\" by the Court of Appeal's final decision, praised it as a vindication of \\"what we have long said\\"‚Äîthe fact that DeCSS \\"has been available on thousands of websites around the world for many years\\".Court Overturns Ban on Posting DeCSS EFF (Sep. 2005). Prior to the California Supreme Court's ruling, attorneys for the DVD CCA felt that the issues at stake in their appeal had broader implications for protection of intellectual property: \\"This has nothing to do with DVDs, or this particular technology, or with how technology is distributed. [Bunner's attorneys] are arguing that you can't issue injunctions under First Amendment, and we think that is contrary to the way laws have been interpreted for the past 200 years\\", said Jeffrey Kessler, a partner at Weil, Gotshal & Manges. He stated that First Amendment protections needed to be balanced against the theft and distribution of intellectual property, as well as the DVD CCA's optimism regarding a ruling in their favor, and that the organization would appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court should the decision go the other way.Paul Roberts, DVD Decryption Case Returns to Court , PC World (May 29, 2003).

They were active in Ireland, Britain, Canada and the United States. They sometimes used violence.E. R. R. Green, \\"The Fenians\\" History Today (Oct 1958) 8#10 pp 698-705. The term Fenian today occurs as a derogatory sectarian term in Ireland, referring to Irish nationalists or Catholics, particularly in Northern Ireland. The term has been used similarly in Scotland as an attempt by Protestants to be a derogatory religious slur to refer to Scottish Catholics or to Scots with Irish ancestry. Fenianism Fenianism (), according to O'Mahony, is symbolised by two principles: firstly, that Ireland has a natural right to independence, and secondly, that this right could be won only by an armed revolution.Ryan, p. 318 The name originated with the Fianna in Irish mythology - groups of legendary warrior-bands associated with Fionn mac Cumhail. Mythological tales of the Fianna became known as the Fenian Cycle. The term Fenianism was sometimes used by opponents in the English political establishment in the 1860s for any form of mobilisation among the Irish or those who expressed any Irish nationalist sentiments, or questioned the Protestant Ascendancy such as by advocating for the rights of tenant farmers. In this sense the term was often applied inaccurately by the political establishment to the unrelated Tenant Right League, Irish National Land League and Irish Parliamentary Party who did not advocate explicitly for an independent Irish Republic or the use of force. The establishment warned people about this perceived threat to turn what they saw as \\"decent civilised\\" society on its head by movements such as trade unionism seeking to change the existing social order in the United Kingdom.McGee, pp. 13‚Äì14 Ireland James Stephens, one of the \\"Men of 1848,\\" (a participant in the 1848 revolt) had established himself in Paris, and was in correspondence with John O'Mahony in the United States and other advanced nationalists at home and abroad. This would include the Phoenix National and Literary Society, with Jeremiah O'Donovan (afterwards known as O'Donovan Rossa) among its more prominent members, which had been formed recently at Skibbereen. Along with Thomas Clarke Luby, John O'Leary and Charles Kickham he founded the Irish Republican Brotherhood on 17 March 1858 in Lombard Street, Dublin. The Fenian Rising in 1867 proved to be a \\"doomed rebellion,\\" poorly organised and with minimal public support. Most of the Irish-American officers who landed at Cork, in the expectation of commanding an army against England, were imprisoned; sporadic disturbances around the country were easily suppressed by the police, army and local militias. In the aftermath, Fenian assassination circles were active in Cork and in Dublin and were responsible for shooting two officers of the Dublin Metropolitan Police while on duty in October 1867. In 1882, a breakaway IRB faction calling itself the Irish National Invincibles assassinated the British Chief Secretary for Ireland Lord Frederick Cavendish and his Permanent Under-secretary (chief civil servant), in an incident known as the Phoenix Park Murders. United States Three Manchester Martyrs of 1867; at right is Michael O'Brien a former Corporal of Battery E 1st New Jersey Artillery regiment Fenian convicts escape from Fremantle in the 1876 Catalpa rescue. The Fenian Brotherhood, the Irish Republican Brotherhood's US branch, was founded by John O'Mahony and Michael Doheny, both of whom had been \\"out\\" (participating in the Young Irelander's rising) in 1848. In the face of nativist suspicion, it quickly established an independent existence, although it still worked to gain Irish American support for armed rebellion in Ireland. Initially, O'Mahony ran operations in the US, sending funds to Stephens and the IRB in Ireland. In 1865 O'Mahony's leadership was challenged, and the movement split, by a faction led by William B. Roberts, a wealthy New York City dry-goods merchant, more closely allied with the Democratic-Party machine. It was Roberts faction that sponsored the plan to invade Canada and hold it hostage for the liberation of Ireland. In 1867 there was a further challenge to O'Mahony from the new IRB exile David Bell, and his weekly the Irish Republic. In contrast to Roberts, Bell, committed to black suffrage and to Reconstruction, was allied to the Republicans and was calling a \\"cleansing\\" of the spirits of the Irish in America: \\"Let our people fling off the scales of bigotry and declare that all men are entitled to 'life, liberty, and happiness.'\\" John Devoy records that in the course of 1866 various conferences where held to reunite the various factions. There were efforts were to elect as president of a united organisation James Stephens. Stephens had escaped the round-up the I.R.B. leadership in Dublin the previous year, but was still promising that that \\"The Irish flag ‚Äî the flag of the Irish Republic ‚Äî will float in an Irish breeze before New Year's Day, 1867\\". At the close of 1866, a conference of the refugees of the I.R.B. and many of the American officers who had been in Ireland was held in New York and pre-sided over by Stephens, at which the decision was taken that the fight should be made early in 1867. Some thousands of rifles which were afterwards sent to Ireland, but arrived too late to be of any use in the Rising. Canada In Canada, Fenian is used to designate a group of Irish radicals, a.k.a. the American branch of the Fenian Brotherhood in the 1860s. They made several attempts to invade some parts of the British colonies of New Brunswick (i.e., Campobello Island) and Canada (present-day Southern Ontario and Missisquoi County), with the raids continuing after these colonies had been confederated. The ultimate goal of the Fenian raids was to hold Canada hostage and therefore be in a position to blackmail the United Kingdom to give Ireland its independence. Because of the invasion attempts, support or collaboration for the Fenians in Canada became very rare even among the Irish. The Battle of Ridgeway was the largest engagement of the Fenian Raids. Francis Bernard McNamee, the man who started the Fenian movement in Montreal (and who was later suspected of being a government spy), was a case in point. In public, he proclaimed his loyalty to the queen and called for an Irish militia company to defend Canada against the Fenians. In private, he wrote that the real purpose of an Irish militia company would be to assist the Fenian invasion, adding for good measure that if the government denied his request he would raise the cry of anti-Irish Catholic discrimination and bring more of his aggrieved countrymen into the Fenian Brotherhood.Further reading: W.

Whelan, was hanged in Ottawa for the assassination of Irish Canadian politician, Thomas D'Arcy McGee in 1868, who had been a member of the Irish Confederation in the 1840s. The danger posed by the Fenian raids was an important element in motivating the British North America colonies to consider a more centralised defence for mutual protection which was ultimately realised through Canadian Confederation. England Fenian Flag, captured by British forces at Tallaght, County Dublin 1867 The Fenians in England and the Empire were a major threat to political stability. In the late 1860s the IRB control centre was in Lancashire. In 1868 the Supreme Council of the IRB, the provisional government of the Irish Republic, was restructured. The four Irish provinces: Connacht, Leinster, Ulster and Munster had representatives on the council, along with Scotland, the north and south of England and London, had representatives on the Council. Later four honorary members were co-opted. The Council elected three members to the executive. The President was chairman, the Treasurer managed recruitment and finance and the Secretary was director of operations. There were IRB Circles in every major city in England. On 23 November 1867, three Fenians, William Philip Allen, Michael O'Brian, and Michael Larkin,In Memoriam, William Philip Allen, Michael O'Brien, and Michael Larkin [original missing], 1867. Box 1, Folder 9, Allen Family Papers, 1867, AIS.1977.14, Archives Service Center, University of Pittsburgh known as the Manchester Martyrs, were executed in Salford for their attack on a police van to release Fenians held captive earlier that year.Allen Family Papers, 1867, AIS.1977.14, Archives Service Center, University of Pittsburgh On 13 December 1867, the Fenians exploded a bomb in attempt to free one of their members being held on remand at Clerkenwell Prison in London. The explosion damaged nearby houses, killed 12 people and caused 120 injuries. None of the prisoners escaped. The bombing was later described as the most infamous action carried out by the Fenians in Great Britain in the 19th century. It enraged the public, causing a backlash of hostility in Britain which undermined efforts to establish home rule or independence for Ireland. Contemporary usage=Northern Ireland In Northern Ireland, Fenian is used by some as a derogatory word for Irish Catholics;Socialist Worker in 2012, British National Party leader Nick Griffin was criticised by Unionists and Republicans for tweeting the term while attending an Ulster Covenant event at Stormont, Belfast; Griffin referred to Lambeg drums, saying \\"the can't match the lambeg, you Fenian bastards\\". Scotland John Keegan 'Leo' Casey (1846 ‚Äì 17 March 1870), known as the Poet of the Fenians The term Fenian is used similarly in Scotland. During Scottish football matches it is often aimed in a sectarian manner at supporters of Celtic F.C. Celtic has its roots in Glasgow's immigrant Catholic Irish population and the club has thus been associated with Irish nationalism, symbolised by the almost universal flying of the Irish Tricolour during matches. Other Scottish clubs that have Irish roots, such as Hibernian and Dundee United, do not have the term applied to them, however. The term is now firmly rooted within the Old Firm rivalry between Celtic and Rangers. Use of the term as a religious slur carried criminal penalties in some contexts under the Offensive Behaviour at Football and Threatening Communications (Scotland) Act 2012, before its repeal in January 2018. Australia In Australia Fenian is used as a pejorative term for those members of the Australian Labor Party (ALP) who have Australian Republican views similar to those who support Irish unification. Michael Atkinson, Attorney-General of South Australia, spoke of those members of the ALP who wished to remove the title Queen's Counsel and other references to the crown as \\"Fenians and Bolsheviks\\" in a speech given at the ALP Convention in Adelaide on 15 October 2006. Atkinson made a further mention of Fenianism when the title of Queen's Counsel was abolished. See also *Taig FootnotesReferences Fenian Plot, Glasnevin, Dublin * E. R. R.

It is named as a combination of Waring's problem on sums of powers of integers, and the Goldbach conjecture on sums of primes. It was initiated by Hua LuogengL. K. Hua: Some results in additive prime number theory, Quart. J. Math. Oxford, 9(1938), 68-80. in 1938. Problem statement It asks whether large numbers can be expressed as a sum, with at most a constant number of terms, of like powers of primes. That is, for any given natural number, k, is it true that for sufficiently large integer N there necessarily exist a set of primes, {p1, p2, ..., pt}, such that N = p1k + p2k + ... + ptk, where t is at most some constant value? The case, k=1, is a weaker version of the Goldbach conjecture. Some progress has been made on the cases k=2 to 7. Heuristic justification By the prime number theorem, the number of k-th powers of a prime below x is of the order x1/k/log x. From this, the number of t-term expressions with sums ‚â§x is roughly xt/k/(log x)t. It is reasonable to assume that for some sufficiently large number t this is x-c, i.e., all numbers up to x are t-fold sums of k-th powers of primes. This argument is, of course, a long way from a strict proof. Relevant results In his monograph,Hua Lo Keng: Additive theory of prime numbers, Translations of Mathematical Monographs, 13, American Mathematical Society, Providence, R.I. 1965 xiii+190 pp using and refining the methods of Hardy, Littlewood and Vinogradov, Hua Luogeng obtains a O(k2log k) upper bound for the number of terms required to exhibit all sufficiently large numbers as the sum of k-th powers of primes. Every sufficiently large odd integer is the sum of 21 fifth powers of primes..

He competed at the 1964 Summer Olympics.  Early life  At the age of fifteen (1955) some friends asked him to come to judo with them. This is how he started at the club of Fiamma Yamato located in via Corvieri in Rome (Italy). He had several masters among which Vittorio Porceddu, Elio Paci, Vinicio Volpi and last but not least Noritomo Ken Otani. Thanks to the latter he was introduced to a judo form much closer to the original Japanese one, allowing him to perfection his judo techniques. Thanks to the skill of this master he learns to understand the term Do, the way, that allows him to reach several goals. Already in 1960 he has his first results by winning the silver medal at the Italian Championships for blue and brown belts, allowing him to open the doors in order to get into the Italian National Squad. In the same year he gets his black belt 1st dan. He continues to win at many National and Regional Tournaments and is noticed by the Federal Sports Director, who calls him to participate at several trainings of the National Team. In 1961 he enters as voluntary the Police at the Sports Center of the Fiamme Oro (Gold Flame, State Police) and is sent to the Sports Center of Nettuno. Here he perfections further more his judo techniques, thanks to the contribution of master Otani and this allows him to win the first Italian Title in the up to 68 kg weight division in Perugia. In the afternoon of the same day he wins also the Silver medal in the open weight division. Another six National Titles follow after this first time in Perugia.  Competitor He is 21 times member of the Italian National Team and participates at 8 European Championships. In 1963 he wins the Silver Medal at the European Championships in Geneva (Switzerland), becoming the first Italian light weight in Italian‚Äôs judo history to reach this goal. The Italian National Olympic Committee adds him to the list of ‚ÄúProbable Olympians‚Äù for the 1964 Tokyo Olympics. He participates at this first time judo event at the Olympic Games along with Nicola Tempesta (the only two Italians who participated in judo). After the competition at the Olympics he becomes a member of the team \\"Rest of the World‚Äù, touring Japan to fight against Japanese teams in Tokyo, Tenri, Nagoya, Yokohama, and Fukuoka, where he places first. Thanks to the help of master Ken Otani he gets a scholarship to enter the University of Tenri (Nara). He remains in Japan for two years studying judo and the Japanese language, getting a diploma in the latter. During his stay there he has had the chance to study under several outstanding masters among which Ken Otani (9th dan), Kotani (10th dan), Ebii (9th dan), Matsumoto (9th dan), Daigo (9th dan), Osawa (8th dan) and Hashimoto (8th dan). He returns to Italy in 1966, where he wins other National Titles and several silver and bronze medals; in total he participates at 44 National Championships.  Trainer In 1970 he quits with competitions and becomes first the trainer of the Junior National Team and then of the Senior Team, followed by the University Team and the National Visually Impaired one, belonging to the National Blind Sports Federation (FICS), later called Italian Federation of Disabled Sport (FISD). Later he becomes the National Sports Director of the later. In 1971 the Italian National Judo Academy is founded, of which he is the first teacher. He is elected to the Council of the Technical Teachers Order of the Federation and after that is part of several National Technical Commissions in order to define the technical programs for grading and qualification and also for teaching.  International career In 1987 he is nominated Chairman for Judo within the International Blind Sport Association (IBSA), position, that he keeps for five Olympic four years periods. He becomes also member of the International Paralympic Committee. He tours the world for conferences, technical and pedagogical updating courses. He has contacts and meetings with the International Judo Federation and the Continental Judo Unions, in which he promotes the cause of the Visually Impaired Athletes under the slogan ‚Äúdisability maximum ability‚Äù. He is Technical Delegate at the following Paralympic Games: Seoul (1988), Barcelona (1992), Atlanta (1996), Sydney (2000), Athens (2004) and VIP Guest at Beijing (2008)and London (2012). He is Director at 11 World Championships, 13 Europeans and 2 Asian Games. He receives many National and International awards among which: Knight to the Merit of the Italian Republic, Gold Star of the National Italian Olympic Committee, Gold Star of the Olympic Committee of the Russian Confederation as first foreigner honored by such award, Ambassador of USA Judo, awards from the Olympic Committees of Algeria, China and Libya. He receives the International Cultural and Sport Lions Club prize, the Bronze Medal from the International Judo Federation and the Honors Medal from the Italian National Judo Federation (FIJLKAM). He is Well-deserving and International Referee, Well-deserving Master. He receives a special motion from the University of Fighting Arts, the Yong In University Korea. In 2018 the FIJLKAM Chairman awards him with the 9th dan, one among the highest recognitions both National and International. He writes many technical books, which deal with judo teaching methods for kids, grading systems, judo‚Äôs pedagogy and psychology, judo‚Äôs culture, the kata, sensorial disabled athletes and their integration thanks to the practice of judo. His books have been translated into English, Spanish, Arabic, Braille and mentioned all around the world. In 2007 he is nominated technical consultant of the Visually Impaired Chinese National Judo Team for the Beijing 2008 Paralympics. Thanks to the outstanding teaching method in favor of the members of the American Police, he is nominated Honor Member of the New Jersey Police (USA) At the Judo World Championships, which took place in S√£o Paulo (Brazil) in June 2007 he won two Silver medals (weight division and open). In 2018 he is awarded by the Association of the National Police Treviso Section and by the CONCILIO DE MAESTROS DE LAS ARTES MARCIALES in Cartegena Spain. He teaches and is Sport Director of the ASD Judo Club Conegliano, Treviso (Italy). Throughout the years he has maintained his strong bond to Japan and since 2006 he has been regularly once or twice a year there. In 2010 the idea to open a Japanese Cultural Center at the Judo Club Conegliano, thus promoting activities such as Japanese Language, Ikebana, Taiko and more. In 2012 he reaches an agreement with the Judo Headquarter in Tenri becoming Tenri Judo Conegliano.

Advertising networks created the organization in response to concerns from the Federal Trade Commission and consumer groups that online advertising ‚Äî particularly targeted or behavioral advertising ‚Äî harmed user privacy. The NAI seeks to provide self-regulatory guidelines for participating networks and opt-out technologies for consumers in order to maintain the value of online advertising while protecting consumer privacy. Membership in the NAI has fluctuated greatly over time, and both the organization and its self- regulatory system have been criticized for being ineffective in promoting privacy.  History  The NAI was formally announced at the Public Workshop on Online Profiling held by the FTC and the Department of Commerce on November 8, 1999. Its membership then consisted of 24/7 Media, AdForce, AdKnowledge, Adsmart, DoubleClick, Engage, Flycast, MatchLogic, NetGravity (a division of DoubleClick) and Real Media. In July 2000, the NAI published a set of principles, negotiated with the FTC and endorsed by the FTC, in their report to Congress on online profiling. In May 2001, the NAI released an accompanying website allowing users to more quickly download opt-out cookies for all participating ad networks. In 2002, the NAI released guidelines for the use of web beacons ‚Äî small images or pieces of code used to track visiting and traffic patterns, and to install cookies on visitors' machines. These guidelines use a similar model of notice and choice as the NAI Principles; opt-in consent is only required when sensitive information is associated with personally identifiable information and transferred to a third party. In 2003, the NAI formed the Email Service Provider Coalition (since renamed the Email Sender and Provider Coalition). The ESPC engages in lobbying, press relations and technical standards development to support \\"email deliverability\\" ‚Äî ensuring that mass email delivery continues despite anti-spam legislation and technologies. Today the two organizations exist entirely independent from each other. In response to a 2007 FTC staff report (Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising), the NAI published an updated set of principles in December 2008 after providing a draft in April for public comments. The new principles incorporated new restrictions on the collection and use of sensitive data and data related to children. In 2009, the NAI launched a consumer education page, which provided a centralized location for a variety of informational articles, videos, and other creative content designed to educate users about online behavioral advertising. In 2010, the NAI joined the Digital Advertising Alliance, a non-profit organization of leading companies and trade associations including the Association of National Advertisers (ANA), the American Association of Advertising Agencies (4As), the Direct Marketing Association (DMA), the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB), the American Advertising Federation (AAF) and the NAI. These associations and their members are dedicated to developing effective self-regulatory solutions to consumer choice for web viewing data. In 2012, the NAI issued its third compliance report, which demonstrated that overall, the NAI member companies continue to meet the obligations of the NAI code. Ad network membership in the NAI fluctuated between 12 members in 2000, two members in 2002-2003 and five members in 2007, prompting criticism that it did not consistently represent or regulate the industry. As of July 2017, the NAI lists over 100 members, including Google, Microsoft and Yahoo!. In 2013, the NAI released its fourth annual compliance report.http://www.networkadvertising.org/2012_NAI_Compliance _ Report.pdf The report described the NAI's planned initiatives for 2013, which included the development of a revised NAI Code of Conducthttp://www.networkadvertising.org/2013_Principles.pdf governing the collection and use of data on mobile devices. Additionally, in 2013, the NAI released its first Mobile Application Code,http://www.networkadvertising.org/mobile/NAI_Mobile_A p plication_Code.pdf which expanded the organization‚Äôs self-regulatory program to cover data collected across mobile applications. In 2014, NAI released its 5th Annual Compliance report, showing that NAI members overwhelmingly met their obligations under the provisions of the code and continued to uphold the NAI's rigorous standards for providing notice and choice around interest-based advertising (IBA). The NAI compliance team reviewed 88 member companies. The NAI also created a prestigious one-year compliance and technology fellowship for highly qualified graduates with an interest in the intersection of technology, advertising and policy. In May 2015, the NAI released an update to the Code of Conduct and its Guidance for NAI Members: \\"Use of Non-Cookie Technologies for Interest-Based Advertising Consistent with the NAI principles and Code of Conduct (Beyond Cookies Guidance)\\". In July 2015, the NAI released its Guidance for NAI Members: \\"Determining Whether Location is Imprecise (Imprecise Location Guidance)\\", which provided clarity on the types of location data that may require opt-in consent. In August 2015, NAI released an update to the Mobile Application Code in order to incorporate many of the changes in the 2015 Update to the NAI Code of Conduct and apply them to the mobile advertising ecosystem. As of January 1, 2016, NAI members engaged in cross-app advertising (CAA) are required to come into compliance with the Mobile App Code. Also in April 2016, NAI welcomed its 100th member, evidence of the continued appeal of the NAI's compliance program. In September 2016, the NAI became one of the founding members of the Coalition for Better Ads, an industry coalition leveraging consumer insights and cross-industry expertise to develop and implement new global standards for online advertising. In 2017, the most recent update to the NAI Code of Conduct was released. Also released in 2017 were updates to the non-cookie technology guidance, titled Guidance for NAI Members: Use of Non-Cookie Technologies for Interest-Based Advertising, and a cross-device linking guidance in May 2017.  NAI principles  The NAI's Self-Regulatory Code of Conducthttp://www.networkadvertising.org/sites/default/files/imce/principles.pdf imposes notice, choice, transparency, education, and data security requirements on members, along with other obligations with respect to the collection and use of data for interest-based advertising (IBA). The Code also limits the types of data that member companies can use for advertising purposes and imposes a host of substantive restrictions on member companies' collection, use, and transfer of data used for interest-based advertising. The NAI mandates that member companies provide users a means to opt out of interest-based advertising. The NAI opt-out toolNAI opt-out tool is a simple web-based utility that allows users to opt out of receiving targeted ads from one, some, or all member companies. The NAI employs a comprehensive compliance and enforcement programhttp://www.networkadvertising.org/pdfs/NAI_Compliance_and_Enforcement%20Procedures.pdf to verify ongoing member compliance with these obligations. The NAI's self- regulatory principles for online behavioral advertising depend on a model of notice and choice. Notice: The NAI principles require \\"clear, meaningful and prominent\\" notice on the member‚Äôs website that describes its data collection, including what behavioral or multi-site advertising the ad network engages in, what types of data they collect for what purposes and for what length of time, data transfer, and use practices for interest-based advertising and/or ad delivery and reporting. Since ads are commonly shown on websites not controlled by the ad network, members must also require that partnering websites that display their ads also provide \\"prominent\\" notice that behavioral advertising is taking place, as well as what data is being collected, for what purposes and with whom it will be shared. Typically, these notices are presented in each website's privacy policy. \\"Robust\\" notice ‚Äî where the notice is presented before personal information is collected ‚Äî is required when personally-identifiable information (\\"name, address, telephone number, email address, financial account number, government-issued identifier and any other data used to identify, contact or precisely locate a person\\") will be merged with other non-identifiable information (like demographics or interests). Choice: Ad networks which satisfy the NAI principles must provide consumers a choice about whether information collected about them is tracked and used to provide targeted advertising. Whether this choice is \\"opt-out\\" or \\"opt-in\\" depends on the type and usage of data. For sensitive information (including Social Security Numbers, financial account numbers, real-time location information and precise information about medical conditions), tracking is always \\"opt-in\\". Also, when previously collected personally- identifiable information is merged with non-identifiable information (and the consumer wasn't provided \\"robust notice\\" of this practice originally), then ad networks must obtain affirmative consent. In all other cases of tracking personally-identifiable and non-identifiable information, choice is provided through an \\"opt-out\\" mechanism: the opt-out cookie. Although HTTP cookies are commonly used by advertising networks to track consumers as they access information across different web sites, the opt-out cookie is used to signal that the consumer has chosen not to have their data collected for providing targeted ads. The NAI provides a tool to download opt-out cookies for each of their member networks: member networks who detect the opt-out cookie must not collect data on that user for targeted advertising. Additional principles prohibit collecting information of children under age 13 or using collected data for non-marketing purposes. Ad networks are required to provide subjects of data collection \\"reasonable\\" access to the personally-identifiable information they collect, make \\"reasonable\\" efforts to use reliable data, provide \\"reasonable\\" security and use \\"reasonable\\" efforts (through the NAI) to educate consumers about targeted advertising. Retention of data is limited to \\"legitimate business needs\\".  Consumer education  In 2013, the NAI unveiled new educational resources for consumers covering a variety of topics and concerns related to online behavioral advertising or internet-based advertising. As part of these efforts, the NAI provides current information and tools that are easy to understand and use, and the organization‚Äôs members donate billions of ad impressions to raise awareness and point consumers to these and other resources. The NAI also provides a framework to help businesses honor consumer preferences and act responsibly. Every NAI member company is required to provide choices through both the NAI and Digital Advertising AllianceDigital Advertising Alliance websites. In addition, NAI requires members to include opt-out tools and comprehensive disclosures on their own websites. Moreover, NAI companies support the Ad Choices icon, just- in-time notice embedded in or around the advertisements consumers see online.http://marketingland.com/nai-revised-code-of-conduct-addresses- interest-based-advertising-concerns-44907  Criticism  The NAI and its set of self-regulatory principles have been widely criticized by consumer advocacy organizations. The World Privacy Forum has argued that the NAI opt-out cookie has been ineffective because consumers don't understand how cookies work, don't realize that cookies can simultaneously track them and be used to signal that they should not be tracked, don't recognize that changing membership in the NAI requires regularly updating their opt-out cookies, and regularly encounter errors on the NAI web site while trying to opt out. Before 2008, the NAI principles covered tracking only via HTTP cookies despite additional technologies for uniquely identifying and tracking browsers, the updated principles explicitly cover Flash cookies and similar technologies. Since its first review in 2007, however, the World Privacy Forum‚Äôs founder has described the NAI improvements ‚Äúprofound,‚Äù calling its 2013 Code of Conduct ‚Äúremarkable‚Äù for a number of reasons. The founder went on to say that the ‚ÄúNAI represents a really important step forward for what self-regulation has been.‚Äù http://new.livestream.com/facebooktalkslive/events/2202468/videos/22657556 Concerns have also been raised about the process for developing and enforcing the NAI principles. The Electronic Privacy Information Center criticized the negotiation of the original set of principles for not substantively including privacy advocates or consumer protection organizations, a concern echoed by seven senators in a letter to then FTC Chairman Pitofsky. The NAI used TRUSTe for third-party enforcement of its principles starting in 2002, but over time TRUSTe provided less and less detail in their reports on consumer complaints about the NAI and stopped reporting these complaints altogether in 2006. When the NAI published updated principles in 2008, it chose to review member compliance itself, which the Center for Democracy and Technology argued would reduce consumer trust in the organization. The NAI responded to this criticism on its blog. The NAI initially allowed for \\"associate members\\" to join the association; these members were not required to comply with the organization's principles. However, this concept was quickly discarded, and all members of the NAI are currently required to comply with the NAI Codes of Conduct and are evaluated regularly.

He began his career as an amateur with Barnet where his prolific scoring record saw him earn a move to Fulham in 1960. He went on to play over 100 games in the Football League, during spells with Watford, Northampton Town and Cardiff City, before he was forced to retire at the age of 27 due to a knee injury. He also represented England at amateur level and Great Britain at the 1960 Summer Olympics, scoring four times in three group matches. Club career=Barnet Born in Streatham in south London, Brown grew up as a fan of Barnet as his father was a keen fan of the club, regularly attending games at Underhill Stadium via the London Underground. At the age of 18, Brown joined his boyhood club as his father had local connections to the club and he was offered a contract by manager George Wheeler. On his arrival, club captain Alf D'Arcy described Brown as \\"A very gifted centre forward, lean and so quick but unusually with a sharp brain to go with it! He would take a row with a centre half in his stride and yet out-think his opponent, and he was incredibly fit too\\". In his first season at the club, he scored 41 times in all competitions to help the club win the Athenian League in the 1958‚Äì59 season and reach the final of the FA Amateur Cup, losing 3‚Äì2 to Crook Town with Brown scoring both goals for the Bees. However, his appearances were limited during the following season due to injury and Brown finished the season with 17 goals. During his time at Barnet, Brown also worked as a fishmonger in Billingsgate Fish Market. Football League Brown remained with Barnet until September 1960, when he joined Fulham, remaining an amateur, working part-time at a cricket bat manufacturer owned by Stuart Surridge. He then moved to Watford, becoming a full-time professional for the first time in his career, and made 28 League appearances for them before transferring to Northampton Town. Brown remained with Northampton for three seasons and was part of the Cobblers team that reached the top division of English football in 1965‚Äì66 season. Cardiff City He moved to Cardiff City in October 1966 for a fee of ¬£15,000, winning the Welsh Cup in his first season at Ninian Park, scoring in the second leg of the final during a 2‚Äì1 victory over Wrexham. As a result of winning the Welsh Cup, Cardiff qualified for the European Cup Winners' Cup the following season and Brown made his European debut on 4 October 1967, scoring a penalty during a 2‚Äì0 win over Irish side Shamrock Rovers in the second leg of the first round. He featured in both legs of the second round against Dutch side NAC Breda, scoring an early goal in the second leg as Cardiff advanced after a 4‚Äì1 win. In the remainder of the campaign, Cardiff would go on to reach the semi-final, the furthest a Welsh club has ever progressed in European competition but, on 26 December 1967, Brown injured his knee during a 3‚Äì0 win over Aston Villa. It was later discovered that he had damaged his cruciate ligament and spent six months in plaster, stating that \\"It was obvious I would never play professionally again\\". He returned to pre-season at Cardiff and also received an offer from Yeovil Town but later took the decision to retire after being told that he could be confined to a wheelchair if he re-injured the knee. International career=England amateur Brown was handed his debut for the England national amateur football team on 20 May 1959, alongside Barnet teammates Roy Sleap and Alf D'Arcy, scoring twice during a 3‚Äì1 victory over the Netherlands at Zuiderpark Stadion. He played in two further matches in the following week, a 3‚Äì1 defeat to Luxembourg, during which he scored again, and a 2‚Äì0 defeat to West Germany. Over the following two seasons, Brown was an integral part of the amateur side, rarely missing a match and scoring consistently for the side, including braces in matches against Scotland and France in 1961. He went on to appear in 14 matches for the side, scoring 12 times. Following his decision to turn professional with Watford at the start of the 1961‚Äì62 season, he became ineligible to represent the amateur side. 1960 Olympics Brown (left) playing for Great Britain against Italy in the 1960 Summer Olympics. Having represented England at amateur level, his performances for Barnet attracted the attention of the manager of the Great Britain Olympic football team, Norman Creek, who had been alerted to Brown following his brace in the 1959 FA Amateur Cup final. While still an amateur, Brown was chosen in the Great Britain squad for the 1960 Summer Olympics, along with his Barnet teammate Roy Sleap. Brown scored in all three of teams group matches, including a brace in their opening game during a 3‚Äì2 defeat to Brazil, as Britain finished the group stage in third-place resulting in their elimination. After seeing Brown score against his Italy side during the tournament, Giuseppe Viani offered Brown a contract at his club side A.C. Milan, however Brown kept the offer on hold as he was due to tour Australasia with an FA XI, which included England internationals such as Tom Finney and Bobby Moore. During the tour, he played in a number of the games against the New Zealand teams, and scored hat-tricks against both Otago and the Minor Provinces. When he returned to England, Brown discovered that Viani had suffered a heart attack and had subsequently stepped down as Milan manager. Later life Brown later worked as a youth coach at Cardiff City for a decade before working a shipping company.

It was recorded over two four-months periods, July to October 2008 and May to July 2009, in Midlake's recording studio in Denton, Texas. Reception In the May 2010 issue of Mojo, the album received the seldom- awarded Instant Classic label. Following Joanna Newsom's Have One On Me, it is the second album to receive this honor since Fleet Foxes' self-titled debut in 2008. The reviewer wrote: \\"If Queen of Denmark were only ... self-lacerating ballads it would still be a work of transcendent beauty, but the second half of the album finds Grant confronting romantic loss with astonishing depth of feeling.\\" In December, the magazine selected Queen of Denmark as its choice for the Best Album of 2010.\\"John Grant getting his sad mojo working\\". Toronto Star, December 3, 2010. The BBC Music review website described the album as \\"One of the most deeply satisfying debut albums of recent times\\", and concluded: \\"Queen of Denmark transcends the sum of its influences by concentrating on the irresistible appeal of sad yet optimistic love songs, classy arrangements and a dark and handsome croon. Midlake‚Äôs only mistake is making John Grant‚Äôs startling debut better than their own records.\\" Mark Edwards wrote in The Sunday Times, \\"One listen to 'Where Dreams Go to Die', for example, and you‚Äôll realise that while Grant can‚Äôt attain perfection in his actual life, he gets pretty close in his art.\\" The Guardian reviewer wrote that \\"after descending into a personal hell of booze, drugs and giving up music for waiting tables, the Coloradan [John Grant] has emerged with a colossus. Backed by superfans Midlake, these are songs of impossible love, near-suicide and redemption, with an air of vastness and contemplation recalling Dennis Wilson's masterpiece, Pacific Ocean Blue.\\" In The Independent, Andy Gill wrote of the album: \\"a near-perfect marriage of his warm baritone with their lush woodwind and keyboard textures, bring to tender life Grant's tales of growing up gay in the midwest.\\" Irish musician Sin√©ad O'Connor covered the track \\"Queen of Denmark\\" on her 2012 album How About I Be Me (And You Be You)?. The album was also included in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.

But after a disturbing alien abduction nightmare, Eric must face the sudden and mysterious disappearance of his girlfriend. Desperate for answers, he meets a beautiful stranger (Danielle Keaton) who lost her boyfriend Josh Donald under similar circumstances. Together, they unravel the mystery, going deeper and deeper into a bizarre world of alien shape-shifters, implanted objects, organ harvesting, and humans seemingly possessed by malevolent forces. Plot The film opens with a childhood \\"abduction\\" scene, later a memory that the main character (Eric Rainer) flashes back to. Then we encounter adult Eric in the midst of a panic attack: He stumbles outside and stares up at a \\"Darkening Sky\\", the stars gradually, impossibly blinking out. When a neighbor (Harold) interrupts and snaps him out of it, Eric cuts the conversation short and goes back inside, where his girlfriend (Lisa) announces that she is tired of his obsession with Alien Abduction‚ÄîEric is laboring on a thesis dismissing UFOs as a \\"modern mythology\\"‚Äîand she breaks up with him. This tips Eric into a removed state of mind; as he focuses on her lips moving, everything fades to silence. Next we encounter Eric returning from a late-night jog. He falls asleep on the sofa and has a nightmare of alien abduction, climaxing with a vision of a strange creature carrying Lisa away. When Eric wakes the next day he finds Lisa missing but convinces himself everything is okay. Later, Eric meets \\"Beth\\", who introduces herself as Harold's (the neighbor's) niece, and for most of the movie, we see Eric pulled into an investigation about what happened to Lisa, encouraged by Beth, who seems driven to convince Eric that aliens are real. We also meet Dr. Connell, a woman whom Eric refers to as his \\"Professor\\", but who seems to react to his contact with alarm and concern (later, she even drops in to check up on him). While investigating with Beth, Eric encounters three people who seem to morph into strange creatures in a way that matches reports of \\"shape shifting\\" aliens. After narrowly escaping the first, Eric is \\"forced\\" to kill the next two: a UFO \\"expert\\" Beth convinces Eric to see, then Lisa's sister Cindy, who appears asking too many questions. Eventually, after becoming lovers, everything leads Eric and Beth back to \\"The Tower\\", an old, abandoned radio station on a hill outside town. Eric breaks into the Tower using a special alien \\"key\\" mysteriously delivered to him, and inside, finds two dead bodies: both people Eric himself killed. Confused and panicking, Eric then finds Harold, his strangely nosy neighbor, who confesses to following Eric and expresses concern for him, describing Eric's recent bizarre behavior and theorizing that Eric might be controlled by aliens. But when Eric notices that Beth‚Äîtold to wait back at the truck‚Äîhas vanished, Eric angers and knocks Harold unconscious, then tries calling Beth's cell phone. He then hears it ringing, but it is coming from inside the Tower. Fearing the worst, Eric goes back inside, follows the ringing to a spot right next to the dead bodies, pulls a tarp aside and finds Lisa's dead body, stabbed to death with a large knife next to the corpse. Flashback cuts suggest that it was Eric who did the killing, and finding Lisa's body knocks Eric into the same strange state of mind we saw earlier, with everything slowly fading away to silence as he heads back outside. Eric kneels by the injured Harold, still gripping the knife, and Harold desperately tries to convince Eric that the aliens are controlling him, asking repeatedly \\"what they made him believe\\" to control him. But Eric remains deaf to Harold's pleas and stabs him in the heart. While Eric carves a gaping wound in Harold's abdomen, then reaches in and removes an organ, another flashing montage of images reveals that at every key point of the past few days' adventure Eric shared with \\"Beth\\", he was in truth alone. The suggestion here is that \\"Beth\\" is the thing that Eric was \\"made to believe\\". Reinforcing this idea is the very next sequence, in which Eric hands off Harold's removed organ to an unseen force, eerily reminiscent of Eric's \\"nightmare\\" on the night it all began. The movie ends with Eric returning to the truck, where he finds Beth waiting, safe and sound. After one final moment of doubt‚Äîwhen Beth suggests they visit \\"Dr. Connell\\", even though Eric distinctly remembers only referring to her as \\"my professor\\"‚ÄîBeth gazes seductively into his eyes, and Eric surrenders completely, starts the truck and drives off to visit (and presumably kill) Dr. Connell, eliminating the last person connected to what has transpired.

A crossing sweeper was a person working as a street sweeper who would sweep a path ahead of people crossing dirty urban streets in exchange for a gratuity. This practice was an informal occupation among the urban poor, primarily during the 19th century. It was the focus of fairly intense study and commentary, and attitudes toward the presence of crossing sweepers on city streets varied greatly among urban residents, ranging from appreciation for their work to feelings that they were a public nuisance. Crossing sweepers also found their way into 19th-century fiction and artwork, including a novel by Charles Dickens and a popular painting by William Powell Frith. Description Crossing sweepers were a common sight on the streets of large cities during much of the 19th century. The predominance of horse-drawn vehicles--and the general uncleanliness of urban streets--entailed certain difficulties in crossing intersections. For example, the long dresses of many elite women might easily be soiled by horse droppings (among other forms of refuse). Crossing sweepers, by sweeping the pavement ahead of a person crossing the street and creating a path that was referred to as a \\"broom walk,\\" thus offered a service, particularly to the more affluent. In his multi-volume work London Labour and the London Poor (published 1851), English journalist Henry Mayhew referred to mid-19th-century crossing-sweeping as \\"one of those occupations which are resorted to as an excuse for begging...\\" Crossing sweeping was likely a \\"last chance\\" source of income for many and had the advantage of requiring little or no startup capital. Those who worked as sweepers were able to ask for money from passersby without necessarily being viewed solely as beggars, and sweepers who regularly worked the same area likely were viewed more sympathetically by those who lived in the neighborhood, leading at times to more formal \\"weekly allowances.\\" Crossing sweepers may have earned a more substantial income in the early 19th century, prior to the arrival of the omnibus, but by the mid-19th century the returns were generally small, with as little as a shilling being considered a \\"good day's earnings\\" even for the relatively privileged sweepers on London's main thoroughfares.Mayhew 466 Among those who worked as crossing sweepers were the elderly and the disabled or, as one 19th- century observer put it, \\"cripples, and old men and women, shrivelled like dry wrinkled apples, who are just strong enough to give the public that real convenience...\\" Children also worked as crossing sweepers, and the occupation was regularly portrayed in the art and literature of the day as the work of an impoverished child, usually a boy.Bills 303. Children sweepers would sometimes work individually and at other times in groups. In the latter situation there was often a designated leader--sometimes styled as \\"king\\"Mayhew 501.--and the money was generally shared. Groups of young crossing sweepers could be territorial and would fight others to maintain control of their \\"turf\\" if necessary. In mid-19th-century New York City, crossing-sweeping was common among young girls, who had even fewer options for earning an income than did lower-class boys (with occasional prostitution being a notable exception). Some observers chronicled the \\"types\\" of crossing sweepers at great length. A piece in Chambers's Edinburgh Journal in 1852 discussed seven categories of sweepers found on the streets of London--Professional Sweeper; Morning Sweeper; Occasional Sweeper; Lucus-a-non; Sunday Sweeper; deformed, maimed, and crippled sweepers; and Female Sweepers--who plied their trade with varying degrees of skill, effort, and financial success. Henry Mayhew differentiated between \\"casual\\" and \\"regular\\" crossing sweepers, with the former only working certain days of the week and/or varying the location at which they worked while the latter swept at one particular corner almost every day. In London Labour and the London Poor Mayhew discussed \\"Able-bodied\\" (divided into \\"male,\\" \\"female,\\" and \\"Irish\\"), \\"Afflicted or crippled,\\" and \\"Juvenile\\" crossing sweepers, offering in-depth observations from and about actual sweepers with whom he spoke.Mayhew 467-507.  Contemporaneous attitudes toward crossing sweeping  Punch showing a crossing sweeper demanding (and being refused) payment from a well-to-do woman. City residents had mixed reactions to crossing sweepers and their presence on urban streets. Richard Rowe viewed crossing-sweeping as \\"little better than a make-believe of work, as a pretext for begging, either directly or by suggestion.\\" Rowe did not see a problem with \\"alms-giving\\" to elderly or disabled crossing sweepers, but overall wanted to see their ranks \\"thinned considerably ‚Äì viz., by the elimination of the adults who are able, and the young who might be trained to do something better...\\" A writer in an 1858 issue of Building News expressed a similarly negative sentiment when referring to \\"those juvenile highwayman who, broom in hand, take possessions of our crossings and level black mail upon the public in general, and timid females in particular.\\" Others viewed crossing sweepers as legitimate workers who provided a useful service and thus differentiated themselves from more nefarious persons encountered in the streets. An 1864 comment in The Art Journal noted that crossing sweepers \\"are of a different class from the pickpocket and vagrant classes who prowl about to make what prizes fall within their reach.\\"Bills 304. In 1882 a self- described \\"Lady Pedestrian\\" wrote the editors of The New York Times lamenting recent prohibitions on street sweepers: > A few years ago there were many children and men who turned out immediately > after a snow-fall, and were daily to be met during the thaw, brushing the > crossings as clean as they could. For this small service many foot > passengers gladly gave a few small coins, regarding the sweepers not as > beggars or vagrants, but as laborers, whose hard and disagreeable work > enabled well-shod people to pass neatly on their way. There has, however, > been a prohibition of street sweepers...The result is that on Wednesday > last...there was not one crossing on which the snow and mud did not come > full two inches above the sole of a thick gaiter, and it was entirely > impossible to find a single crossing to the opposite side of the avenue > which could be trod without sinking to the ankle...let us have the volunteer > sweepers back for the comfort of a LADY PEDESTRIAN. Some older crossing sweepers suffered abuse from their fellow citizens, at times from children. Rowe described one London man, called \\"Parson,\\" who was regularly \\"tormented\\" by youths of the street. However \\"the police and the omnibus-men, the newsvendors and the miscellaneous loungers hanging about the inn in front of which Parson's crossing, or rather crossings, stretched, did their best to protect the old fellow, and soundly cuffed his persecutors when they chanced to run their way...\\" In his detailed account of the lives and work of crossing sweepers, Henry Mayhew concluded that, \\"taken as a class, crossing-sweepers are among the most honest of the London poor. They all tell you that, without a good character and 'the respect of the neighborhood,' there is not a living to be got out of the broom.\\"Mayhew 466.  In literature and art  The occupation of crossing sweeper received perhaps its most famous literary treatment in Charles Dickens' novel Bleak House with the character of Jo, a homeless boy who \\"fights it out at his crossing among the mud and wheels, the horses, whips, and umbrellas, and gets but a scanty sum...\\" Jo has been characterized as \\"one of the most significant figures\\" in the novel and as a way for Dickens to address juvenile vagrancy, which was seen as a serious social problem at the time. Dickens described Jo as: > not a genuine foreign-grown savage; he is the ordinary home-made article. > Dirty, ugly, disagreeable to all the senses, in body a common creature of > the common streets, only in soul a heathen. Homely filth begrimes him, > homely parasites devour him, homely sores are in him, homely rags are on > him; native ignorance, the growth of English soil and climate, sinks his > immortal nature lower than the beasts that perish. One scholar characterized Jo as being \\"depicted as almost completely bereft of agency, a child swept along by circumstances, made merely to 'move on,'\\" a member of \\"a nation that fails to recognize him as one of its citizens.\\" Jo was a popular character among readers of the novel which no doubt in part led to the production of a stage adaptation entitled Bleak House; or Poor 'Jo. A drama in four acts. 1856 cartoon from Punch showing \\"the crossing sweeper nuisance.\\" A real fourteen-year-old youth named George Ruby who was called to testify at the Guildhall in 1850 is often thought to have been Dickens' inspiration for Jo (who, in the novel, was called to testify before an inquest). While not disagreeing with that assessment, Edwin M. Eigner and Joseph I. Fradin have argued that an earlier, literary precedent comes from Edward Bulwer-Lytton's 1846 novel Lucretia, which also featured a young male crossing sweeper, this one named Beck. Eigner and Fradin suggest that both Jo and Beck are intensely symbolic figures for the two novelists, \\"the representative orphan of an entire society.\\" An even earlier literary portrayal can be found in William Makepeace Thackeray's 1838 story, \\"Miss Shum's Husband,\\" in which the apparently respectable husband actually makes his money as a crossing sweeper, to the horror of his servant Yellowplush. Crossing sweepers were also regularly portrayed in the visual arts, and Mark Bills argues that \\"from the late eighteenth century, prints of crossing sweepers invariably had a satirical purpose.\\" Robert Sayer, William Marshall Craig, and Thomas Rowlandson all created prints of crossing sweepers in the late 18th century or early 19th century.Bills 303-304. In the 1850s Punch magazine frequently printed satirical images of crossing sweepers, depicting \\"each one [as] a nuisance of modern life.\\" An 1856 article in the magazine entitled \\"The Crossing Sweeper Nuisance\\" offered nineteen humorous descriptions of different sweepers, including (invented) tales of woe designed to elicit sympathy, for example \\"a Crimean soldier, who was flogged and dismissed the army for protecting a female from the insults of his commanding officer.\\" A more sympathetic portrayal was William Powell Frith's 1856 painting The Crossing Sweeper (pictured at the top of this article), the popularity of which was evinced by a market for painted and engraved replicas of the image.Bills 307. Frith was a friend of Dickens and had painted versions of his characters before, though his model for The Crossing Sweeper was a real boy.Bills 304-305. According to Frith's autobiography, the crossing sweeper who modelled for his painting attempted to steal Frith's gold pocket watch when the artist went out for lunch. Beginning in 1876 the British actress, Jennie Lee, made a career out of playing Jo, the crossing-sweeper, in the popular play Jo, a melodrama John Pringle Burnett based on Bleak House.Jennie Lee, Veteran Actress, Passes Away.

Type Ic supernova are a rare type of supernova that result from the explosion of a very massive star that has shed its outer layers of hydrogen and helium. The explosion results in a highly luminous burst of radiation that then dims over the course of weeks or months. SN 1994I was a relatively nearby supernova, and provided an important addition to the then small collection of known Type Ic supernova. Very early images were captured of SN 1994I, as two high school students in Oil City, Pennsylvania serendipitously took images of the Whirlpool Galaxy using the 30-inch telescope at Leuschner Observatory on March 31, 1994, which included SN 1994I just after it began to brighten. Discovery and observations SN 1994I was independently discovered by multiple observers, with the first reports from amateur astronomers Tim Puckett and Jerry Armstrong, followed within the hour by reports by amateurs Wayne Johnson and Doug Millar, Richard Berry, and Reiki Kushida. It was confirmed quickly by Michael Richmond and Alex Filippenko using the Berkeley Automated Imaging Telescope at Leuschner Observatory, who noted that SN 1994I was particularly blue. Initial reports disagreed on the nature of the supernova, with different teams claiming that it was a Type Ia supernova, a Type II supernova, and a Type Ic supernova. Supernova types are observationally distinguished by the presence or absence of spectral lines, with hydrogen being the most important diagnostic. After a week of more data being collected, consensus grew among observers that SN 1994I was a Type Ic. By chance, observations of SN 1994I were obtained before its discovery was reported. High school students Heather Tartara and Melody Spence requested observations of the Whirlpool Galaxy on March 29 and 31, 1994. Their request was made through the Hands-On Universe program, which allows elementary and high school students to request observations on automated telescopes. Their images captured the Whirlpool Galaxy just before and after SN 1994I began to brighten, and are some of the earliest data recorded for a supernova. Characteristics The progenitors of Type Ib, Ic, and II supernovae are commonly called core-collapse supernovae, as they result from massive stars that cannot produce enough pressure to balance the inward force of self- gravity. Yet all Type I supernova are distinguished by their lack of hydrogen absorption lines, and Type Ic also lack helium lines. Initial failure to detect hydrogen or helium led to SN 1994I being classified as a Type Ic. Follow-up observations showed very weak helium absorption features, and thus SN 1994I seems to bridge the two classes, though it is still considered one of the best examples of a Type Ic supernova. There are two proposed mechanisms for removing the hydrogen. One suggests that the progenitors of Type Ib and Ic may be Wolf-Rayet stars, as they produce stellar winds that could blow away the hydrogen. The other possibility is mass transfer to a companion star. The proximity of SN 1994I allowed for detailed comparison of models to the observations. These comparisons showed that SN 1994I was consistent with having lost its outer layers to a companion.

Part of a select group who revolutionised jewellery design in the early 1960s, he went on to establish a successful business and an international reputation. His work captures the late twentieth century ideals of glamour and modernity. Born in 1928 to a golfing father and a socially ambitious mother, John Donald attended art college as a compromise between sport and university. He studied graphic design at Farnham, and in 1952 he was offered the chance to enrol in the Metalwork Department of the Royal College of Art. This change of direction was essentially a pragmatic one, as the young man was keen to experience London. But he soon discovered an affinity for working with metal that would shape the rest of his life. At college John Donald joined a group of hard-working (and hard-playing) ex- servicemen, often staying in the studio late into the night. He shared digs in Chelsea with fellow metalwork students Robert Welch and Gerald Benney. All three friends would later become famous for their silver and jewellery designs. He graduated in 1955, and left a year later with a first-class degree. However it was several years before he could establish himself as a jeweller, and in the meantime he was forced to support himself through a combination of male modelling and industrial design. In 1960 the proceeds from designing luggage and National Health spectacles at last allowed him to buy his own studio. A year later he entered five pieces in the seminal International Exhibition of Modern Jewellery 1890-1961, held at Goldsmiths' Hall, and by 1964 he could number Princess Margaret and the Queen Mother among his patrons. John Donald's designs perfectly caught the mood of freedom and excitement which swept Britain during the 1960s. Using simple materials such as gold rod and uncut crystal, he created expressive, abstract pieces free from the conventions of shape and style which had constrained earlier jewels. He was one of a small group of craftsmen whose radical entries to the International Exhibition ushered in a new era of modern jewellery. Characterised by adventurous forms and textures, the movement deliberately avoided showcasing precious materials or artificially imposing a subject. It was, as the sponsors of the exhibition proclaimed, \\"as uninhibited as modern sculpture, or fashion; individual, imaginative and smart'. Experimental techniques John Donald's jewellery is characterised by the dynamic energy created by its unusual forms and textures. He started experimenting with gold and precious stones during the late 1950s, and his difficult circumstances during that time forced him to take creative new directions. In 1957 he bought a quantity of gold rods and chenier, a small-bore tubing supplied directly by bullion merchants. It was some of the only gold the struggling jeweller could afford, but by cutting it into angled lengths or fusing tiny cross-sections, he was able to create dramatic geometric patterns. The natural form of crystals was another source of inspiration. Less expensive and more diverse than conventional jewels, their planes and striations were echoed in his textured surfaces. One of his most distinctive motifs - the cube - directly developed from his use of square-shaped iron pyrites. The experimentation continued when he moved into his own studio in 1960, and it was here that he created another important motif: the bead and cup. Pouring molten gold into cold water, he discovered that it divided into small beads, some of which caught bubbles of air and cooled into hollow cups. The beads were painstakingly soldered together, creating a complex surface of contrasting of convex and concave shapes. He later cast bead and cup sections, enabling him to use them in larger scale designs. Beautiful, intricate and thoroughly modern, the jewels created with these techniques make a big impact using only simple components. Crowns, shadows and the concern for texture One of John Donald's signature techniques is the striking drum or crown mount. Framed by a protective basket of textured gold, gems are set at the end of tiny rods to form glittering openwork constellations. He has modestly said that the method was developed as a way round his lack of conventional skills, however fixing the narrow rods into their tiny screw-holes requires a high level of technical expertise. The mounts are wholly unique and allow a delicacy of setting almost impossible with more traditional designs. The drums themselves reveal other John Donald trademarks: textured 'nugget flakes' and 'wavy rods'. Continuing his experiments with immersing molten metal in water, the young jeweller discovered he could use this process to produce small flakes whose nugget-like surface gave the gold an almost organic appearance. These could be used in a variety of forms, but they were especially effective when combined with the sinuous shapes of melted gold rod. Melting was also used to give other gold elements a fluid feel, especially in the \\"nugget-edged' apertures which appear in some of his most spectacular jewellery. All these methods highlight John Donald's deep preoccupation with the effects of texture of light. Like many of his contemporaries, he rejected the monotony of traditional polished surfaces. Instead his work contrasts the glow of uneven metal with highly polished sheens and dazzling gemstones, the shadows cast by his three dimensional forms adding an extra element of drama. A very fashionable craftsman From the early 1960s John Donald's reputation grew rapidly. His work found favour with women of fashion as well as critics, and he was able to produce jewellery whose avant-garde design was matched only by the beauty of their precious materials. He married in 1962, and soon had two young children living above his Bayswater workshop. By the middle of the decade both John Donald's business and his family were starting to outgrow his modest Bayswater workshop and premises above it, and he began searching for a new studio. The site he eventually chose was 120 Cheapside, a small shop at the front of the new Schroder's Bank building. This was a significant choice; by moving to a shop in the City he was opting not only to independently retail his work, but to do so away from the traditional hub of the West End. However he went ahead, and in 1968 opened a small but elegant gallery and workshop, delighting his landlords by bringing a working jeweller back to the Elizabethan 'Goldsmiths Row'. The years that followed saw his business grow exponentially. He opened one retail shop in Bond Street in 1971, and another in Richmond in 1973. The former enterprise was a partnership with Tecla pearls; although lasting not much more than a year, it allowed him to develop his imaginative and sensitive use of the gems. The outlets enabled John Donald to bring his innovative designs to a wide audience of more ordinary clients as well as his grand patrons from the banking and aristocratic worlds. Eastern colour and old- fashioned influences John Donald travelled overseas right from the start of his career, building up his international profile by exhibiting and selling new work in Europe, America and Japan. However his most important links were with the Middle East, and it was this region which inspired many of his designs in the closing decades of the century. He made his first visit there in 1969, holding a small exhibition at the Sheraton Hotel in Kuwait. It was an immediate success and he returned in 1971, when his three-week stay earned enough money to see him through the crippling economic downturn which marked the beginning of that year. The intense sunlight of the Middle East drove him to be much bolder with his use of colours. The Islamic tiles and decorations he encountered on these trips were another source of new ideas. Another great (if unlikely) influence on John Donald's work originates much closer to home. The quintessentially modern designer has studied Victorian jewellery, admiring its 'intricate, thoughtful and honestly decorative' style. As a young student at the Royal College of Art he spent time looking at the Victoria and Albert Museum's extensive collection of 19th century jewels. Their elegant natural shapes and attention to detail find echoes in many of his pieces, especially those which employ ingenious movable or interchangeable parts. Brooches Brooches were the first pieces of jewellery made by John Donald using his innovative new techniques, and they launched his career as an artist-jeweller, several examples representing his work at the 1961 International Exhibition of Modern Jewellery. The straight forward way in which brooches are worn gives maximum scope for experimentation, and as a result he has always had a special fondness for this versatile ornament. Such creative freedom means that some of his most important ideas can be traced through brooch design. Growth forms, including minute organisms and minerals have been a theme informing his work from the very beginning. The young John Donald was one of the first jewellers to use uncut crystals, studying specimens in the Natural History Museum. The dramatic, baroque expression of many examples reveals a wholly different influence: a travelling scholarship he took to Italy in 1955. Here he absorbed the energy' and drama of the country's treasures. But no matter how diverse, his brooches (like all his work) are united by two overarching concerns. The first is for the balance and integrity of his designs. According to John Donald 'all stones, however valuable, however beautiful, must be subordinate to design'. The second is for their relationship with the wearer. He has always maintained that 'I am very aware that my pieces are to be worn, and when working on commissioned objects, always take into account, not only the appearance but the personality of the wearer'. Out of the City and into the future For 37 years the Cheapside shop occupied a unique place in the City of London. The modern financial centre has its roots in the many goldsmiths workshops which populated the area in past centuries, and as the only working goldsmith within the City's boundaries, John Donald provided an important link with these historic origins. This significant position was cemented by his very traditional role in creating pieces for the City's Livery' Companies. John Donald has designed official regalia since the outset of his career, producing his very first badge in 1956 whilst still a student at the Royal College of Art. His first significant commission as an independent jeweller was to make three Warden's Badges for the Goldsmiths' Company. He was awarded the project in 1960, after winning a limited competition whose brief was to combine contemporary design with the Company's ancient heraldic motifs. Since then he has made over 120 official badges, all of which echo the skillful integration of old and new seen on this early example. Years of experience have also made him aware of not only the aesthetic but also the practical requirements of such pieces. Many are taken for repair after spending an eventful night tucked in the back pocket of a returning official, so his designs are robust as well as attractive. The City lost its last goldsmith in 2005, when re-development led to the closure of the 120 Cheapside shop. However John Donald's contribution to the world of precious metals is certainly far from over; he is still driven with a passion for making beautiful objects, and has planned a very active 'semi-retirement' working on specially commissioned pieces. It is this desire for the hands-on experience of creation which has made his work so distinctive. A consummate craftsman, he has always been dedicated to producing things by hand, believing in the importance of experimenting as a piece is made. John Donald claims that there have been no ‚Äòeureka‚Äô moments in his career, that his designs have instead evolved slowly over time. This gradual distillation of ideas has enabled him to continue to innovate so that even now, when his early work is being sold as prestigious antiques, his jewellery displays an undeniable feeling of modernity.

The story was set in an alternative history 1970s, in which Nazi Germany won World War II and England is run by a collaborationist fascist government. Peter Ingram (Kenneth More) is a writer for a soap opera (also called An Englishman's Castle), which is set in London in 1940, during the fictional Nazi invasion and subsequent occupation. Plot Peter Ingram is a successful London screenwriter, the creator of one of the most popular television shows in Nazi-occupied Europe, An Englishman's Castle. It is a period soap opera, following an ordinary London family during an imagined German invasion of England in 1940. Ingram is oblivious to Nazi rule, which is hidden behind a fa√ßade of seemingly-normal English daily life. The invasion was followed by several years of guerrilla warfare, which ended in a truce with Germany and an amnesty that enabled the resisters to resume normal daily life in return for accepting the reality of German occupation, which they generally did, feeling that further resistance was futile. Ingram's show furthers the feeling among the population in the present (1978) and so is highly valuable to the authorities. A kind of normal was restored, with few Germans to be seen in the streets. German rule is maintained mainly through an extensive system of collaborators, known as \\"delators\\". When dissidents are detained it is done by polite, soft-spoken English police but they are then delivered to torture chambers, kept discreetly out of sight. Ingram gradually becomes aware of the real state of things. He encounters his superiors' firm objection to the inclusion of a character with a Jewish name in the series. The series is largely based on his life, he argues and the Jewish man was a real friend. Having such a character would violate the official policy of letting the extermination of the Jews remain forgotten, never discussed openly. Ingram discovers that his mistress, Jill, one of the stars of his show, is secretly Jewish and a member of a clandestine resistance movement. Eventually, his loyalties are tested and he sides with the resistance. When the resistance decides to include the code word that will signal a nationwide insurgency in his show, due to its huge audience, he complies, allowing Sally (Jill) to speak the phrase when it is filmed. In the closing scene, he locks himself in his office as the episode is broadcast, cuts off the feed just before her scene airs and speaks the phrase himself instead, live over the air. As the sounds of a rebellion against the collaborationist government begin to come through the windows of his office, Ingram awaits the secret police; when someone breaks down the door he turns to stare at the unseen intruder.

Though not regarded as a great writer, he was best known for providing the first reports of the German troops marching into Paris during the Franco-Prussian War in 1871. He was also present during the period of the Paris Commune, as well as the coronation of Tsar Alexander III. He enjoyed a good relationship with first Joseph Moses Levy and then his son Edward Levy-Lawson, successive owners of the Daily Telegraph. When the senior Levy died, Le Sage was named as editor, though Levy-Lawson exercised firm control over the newspaper until he became Baron Burnham in 1903. As editor, Le Sage continued the traditions laid out by his predecessors, focusing on the middle class reader and ignoring criticism of his practices. Though Le Sage proved a successful editor, by the early 20th century he was having difficulties keeping up with changes in the journalistic profession. Hampered by his age and an unwillingness to delegate responsibility, he nonetheless continued on as editor and was knighted in 1918 in recognition for his services to journalism. Le Sage retired from his post in June 1923 and died on New Year's Day, 1926, at his home in Fulham.J. B. Firth, rev.

It is run as a cooperative and in 2016-17 the company had a turnover of ¬£464m. As well as 55 stores, the firm owns feed mills, fertiliser blending plants, a specialist mineral plant and farm building division.  History  Mole Valley Farmers was founded in 1960 by a small group of farmers in South Molton, Devon. The aim was to create an agricultural buying-group that would be able to offer agricultural items to farmers at lower prices by buying in bulk. Mole Valley Farmers takes its name from an area in North Devon, between the towns of North Molton and South Molton. The River Mole runs through this area. There is no connection with the Mole Valley, a district in Surrey in South East England or the River Mole that runs between Dorking and Leatherhead.  Business model  The company is operated as a cooperative with members each holding shares in the company. A key part of this is that the company operates on the smallest margin possible to allow continuity and growth. It is not a requirement to be a member of the company to shop there. Today, Mole Valley Farmers is one of the few agricultural cooperatives in the supply industry and one of the largest in the UK. Mole Valley Farmers owns thirteen branches in South West England, their own feed mills (for animal feeds, at Calne Dorchester, Huntworth and Lifton), fertiliser blending plants, a specialist mineral plant (at Bridgwater), a farm building division (at Witheridge) and a commercial / informational website. The range of goods supplied by Mole Valley Farmers has grown since the company's early beginnings and now includes lifestyle products such as clothing, footwear, garden supplies, pet food, white goods and power tools. However, the firm still has a focus on supplying farmers with direct- to-farm bulk agricultural products. In 2016-17 the company had a turnover of had a turnover of ¬£464m. The company's closest competitors include ForFarmers, NWF Agriculture, and the Wynnstay Group.  Locations  Mole Valley Farmers has nine branches throughout South West England. These are: * South Molton - Opened 1960 (original location) * Yeovil - Opened 1977 * Bridgwater - Opened 1980 * Holsworthy - Opened: 1982 (current location), 1973 (original location) * St Columb Major - Opened 1986 * Newton Abbot - Opened 1987 * Frome - Opened: 1990 (current location), 1982 (original location) * Cullompton - Opened 1993 * Liskeard - Opened 1995 * Penzance - Opened 2018 * Tavistock - Opened 2018 * Bridgend - FarmDirect  Mergers and acquisitions  In 2002, Mole Valley Farmers acquired SCATS Countrystores, which has 19 stores across the south of England. and bought the Buckinghamshire-based rural supplier, Cox & Robinson Farm and Country in 2011.  Countrywide acquisition  On 27 October it was announced that Mole Valley had agreed to acquire all retail store locations along with the website and staff from Countrywide. However, this was subject to review by the Competition and Markets Authority and on 6 March 2018 the CMA referred the buy out for an in-depth phase 2 investigation. Countrywide concluded that it would be unable to meet its financial obligations for this extended period of time and so went into administration.

The aim of Big Writing is to advise schools on how to raise attainment level in speaking, listening and writing. The method is currently used by numerous schools, primarily in the UK but also overseas. The target audience for Big writing are Key Stage 1 and Key Stage 2 students (i.e. those aged 5 to 11), although a slightly adjusted method is also taught that focuses on Foundation stage pupils and is known as 'Big Talk'. Andrell Education claims that Big Writing has proven to be successful in a number of schools, both with teachers and pupils, and points to case studies as evidence of this. Description The first part of the Big Writing course to be developed was the Criterion Scale, an assessment tool linked to National Curriculum levels. From October 1999, Wilson spent three years working with the Kirklees LEA re-assessing work other teachers had already graded. During this time she read through and marked around 20,000 pieces of writing and observed that some teachers struggled to properly assess work, and had too high of an opinion of their pupils' writing. She also noticed the students who were underachieving, particularly the ones that teachers had given too high a grade, all had similar weaknesses in their writing. Ros Wilson decided to develop a standard that teachers could use to assess pupils' writing more accurately, and in a way that Wilson claims is more scientific. Using this, Wilson believes teachers can more accurately assess a student's work, and provide better targeted teaching and more helpful feedback. In order to address the weaknesses in children's writing that she noted as being common across schools, Wilson identified four features that she believes are key to improving writing in the primary age range: vocabulary, connectives, openers and punctuation, or V.C.O.P. Stealing and borrowing are also encouraged when pupils see elements of V.C.O.P. in peers' work that they like. Together with the Criterion Scale, V.C.O.P. became a core part of the Big Writing approach, which Wilson and Andrell Education have promoted through books and professional development courses. Big Writing also emphasises talk for writing, and that pupils need to be taught to speak Standard English in order to help them make fewer spelling and grammar mistakes in their writing. Andrell advises that classes have regular Big Write sessions (ideally lasting one and a half hours, in order to allow children time to write at length), perhaps once a week, as well as regular short exercises throughout the school week in which children develop writing and editing skills with a focus on V.C.O.P. Ros Wilson also advocates creating a positive environment for a writing through the use of candles, music and whatever else a teacher feels is beneficial in creating the right mood for learning.

They are used to treat certain gastrointestinal symptoms, including abdominal discomfort, bloating, constipation, heart burn, nausea, and vomiting; and certain gastrointestinal disorders, including irritable bowel syndrome, gastritis, gastroparesis, and functional dyspepsia. Most prokinetic agents are grouped under the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System (a World Health Organization drug classification system), as ATC code A03F.  Pharmacodynamics  Activation of a wide range of serotonin receptors by serotonin itself or by certain prokinetic drugs results in enhanced gastrointestinal motility. Other prokinetic drugs may increase acetylcholine concentrations by stimulating the M1 receptor which causes acetylcholine release, or by inhibiting the enzyme acetylcholinesterase which metabolizes acetylcholine. Higher acetylcholine levels increase gastrointestinal peristalsis and further increase pressure on the lower esophageal sphincter, thereby stimulating gastrointestinal motility, accelerating gastric emptying, and improving gastro-duodenal coordination. The 5-HT4 receptor is thought to play a significant role in both the physiology and pathophysiology of GI tract motility. Therefore, 5-HT4 receptors have been identified as potential therapeutic targets for diseases related to GI dysmotility such as chronic constipation. Some of these prokinetic agents, such as mosapride and cisapride, classic benzamides, have only moderate affinity for 5HT4 receptors. In recent years, it has become clear that the selectivity profile is a major determinant of the risk-benefit profile of this class of agent. As such, the relatively poor selectivity profile of cisapride versus other receptors (especially hERG [human ether-a-go-go K+] channels) contributes to its potential to cause cardiac arrhythmias. Prucalopride, a first in class benzofuran, is a selective, high affinity serotonin (5-HT4) receptor agonist that stimulates colonic mass movements, which provide the main propulsive force to defecation.SmPC. Summary of product characteristics Resolor (prucalopride)October, 2009:1-9.Bouras EP, Camilleri M, Burton DD, McKinzie S. Selective stimulation of colonic transit by the benzofuran 5HT4 agonist, prucalopride, in healthy humans. Gut. May 1999;44(5):682-686. SSRIs have been found to have prokinetic actions on the small intestine. Other molecules, including macrolides such as mitemcinal and erythromycin, have affinity for the motilin receptor where they act as agonists resulting in prokinetic properties. Research Animal research has found that supplementation with the probiotics Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Bifidobacterium lactis enhances the speed and strength of phase III of the migrating motor complex in the small intestine resulting in reduced small intestinal bacterial overgrowth and bacterial translocation. Research in rats has found that supplementation with Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium bifidum increases small intestinal motility with a measurable decrease in the duration of migrating motor complex cycles. A further study found that in rats supplemented with a diet of Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Bifidobacterium lactis, the number and velocity of phase iii of the migrating motor complex increased. These effects make the small intestine more effective at propelling food, bacteria and luminal secretions into the colon. Bifidobacterium bifidum in combination with Lactobacillus acidophilus accelerated small intestine transit in rats. Research into the prokinetic effects of probiotics on the gastrointestinal tract has also been conducted in humans. Lactobacillus reuteri in infants and Lactobacillus casei and Bifidobacterium breve in children have been found to be effective in the treatment of constipation. Lactobacillus plantarum, in adults has been found to increase defecation frequency.

Samuel Dill observed that \\"the Novellae seem to show him the great statesman of the time.\\"Dill, Samuel, Roman Society in the Last Century of the Western Empire, Adamant Media Corporation, , p. 279 n. 4 He was Praetorian prefect of Gaul in 440, when Pope Leo I was called on to mediate a quarrel between him and the magister militum Aetius.Prosper, Chronicle ch. 1341 (B.L. Twyman notes that Prosper's language \\"is conventional, and that the notice reveals only the fact of the resolution of a quarrel, not any actual friendship between Aetius and Albinus.\\"Twyman, \\"Aetius and the Aristocracy\\", Historia: Zeitschrift f√ºr Alte Geschichte, 19 (1970), p. 491) The cause of their quarrel is not known. After Petronius Maximus ended his tenure as Praetorian prefect of Italy sometime in 441,Petronius is last attested as praetorian prefect 14 March 441; Novelae Valentinii 3.10 a rapid succession of successors to the post followed until Albinus was appointed, prior to 17 August 443, for the second time we are told.Novelae Valentinii II.3 He held this position until sometime between 3 June 448 and 17 June 449. Twyman finds the length of Albinus' prefecture \\"most striking\\"; Albinus was able to exert the authority of his office, bringing stability to the government.Twyman, \\"Aetius and the Aristocracy\\", p. 490 Ronald J. Weber suggests that the reason for Albinus' long tenure was not in response to the growing hegemony of Aetius, but \\"that he gained office in response to a perceived need and that the length of the crises facilitated his long tenure.\\"Weber, \\"Albinus: The Living Memory of a Fifth-Century Personality\\", Historia: Zeitschrift f√ºr Alte Geschichte, 38 (1989), p. 491 Specifically, his lengthy term was a response to the loss of Africa to the Vandals, which was solemnized with an agreement to divide North Africa between Gaiseric and the Roman Empire (442). His family enjoyed extensive influence in the North African provinces, so he was best positioned to exert authority on behalf of the increasingly impoverished empire. As Weber concludes, \\"Caecina Decius Acinatius Albinus could have exercised his patronage in Africa. He may have been among the last to do it.\\"Weber, \\"Albinus\\", p. 496 In 446, Albinus received the title of patricius. How long he lived after his tenure as Praetorian prefect of Italy is unknown.

Applixware was originally created by Applix, Inc.. Alis Finally, Some Answers in Wonderland Applix's first office suite, introduced in 1986, was called Alis, and was marketed with Alice in Wonderland themed promotional items. One such was a mug depicting the tea party scene from the book, with a Cheshire Cat that disappeared when the mug was filled with a hot beverage. Alis was available for Unix workstations from Digital Equipment Corporation, Sun Microsystems and others. Two site licenses were sold for Digital's VMS operating system, one to Exxon and one to a brokerage in New York City. In addition to providing a graphical office suite environment with a number of modules including word processing functions, very advanced for the time, Alis was distinguished by a very powerful scripting language called \\"ELF\\", which was capable of, for example, reading spreadsheet data, performing calculations on it, and merging results into text documents. Aster*x and Applixware Applixware's next major project was called Aster*x but was renamed to Applixware to avoid confusion with Asterix the comic book hero. Applixware was a suite of office tools consisting of four major components: a WYSIWYG word processor, an email client, a spreadsheet editor, and a database program. It also included a scripting language that allowed users to customize its functionality, and even add new components or programs. During the mid-1990s, Applixware was one of a small number of office suites available for Unix systems. Competitors included products from Island Software and proprietary software from the computer hardware companies. In the late 1990s, Linux began to emerge as a desktop operating system, and Applixware was ported to Linux, becoming the first graphical office suite for the platform. Sales expanded to the point where Applixware was available across the USA as shrink- wrapped software on retail shelves at stores like CompUSA and Microcenter. A subset of Applixware modules for Linux was originally developed by Applix upon request from Red Hat, who sold the package for $500. This price was reduced to $200 in October 1996, and, by 2000, during the dotcom bubble, the Applixware Words word processor was available for $50 in GTK toolkit versions (Applixware 5.0 and Anyware 2.2) while the full Applix Office suite was sold for US$99. Anywhere Office was built as a Java application that could run on in any Java virtual machine. These offers (and the GTK toolkit) were subsequently abandoned when the dotcom bubble burst, and priority was given back to versions aimed at Vistasource's core customers in financial, defense and government markets. While not the first graphical word processor for Linux (EZ Word, part of the Andrew User Interface System, has that honor), nor the first proprietary word processor for Linux (WordPerfect was first made available for Linux by Caldera in late 1995), Applixware Words was a good deal more user- friendly than EZ Word and a good deal more bug-free than early Linux releases of WordPerfect. In 1999, Sun Microsystems bought a competing product, StarOffice, and turned it into the open source OpenOffice.org software suite. That destroyed the market for the competing software, and Applixware sales declined. The Applixware Words module waned in popularity among Linux users when full-featured open-source word processors, such as OpenOffice.org and AbiWord, became available. Although Applixware was less powerful than the newer office packages, its interface design was arguably superior. While OpenOffice.org tried to make the user experience to be similar to that of Microsoft Office, Applixware was different. Almost no user interface panel was implemented as a modal window. All control elements could be opened by the user and if a control panel was not applicable in the current context, it just made all its widgets inactive. Although a non-modal interface design significantly increases the complexity of the program, it also makes the GUI to feel more responsive to the user. In addition, Applixware's charting capabilities remarkably surpassed that of the Charts in OpenOffice.org 1.x and 2.x versions. Some graphics features were also much more advanced than what the Draw module in OpenOffice.org is capable of. Another feature of Applixware was its small resource requirements; it ran in a satisfactory manner even on low-end machines of the time. Applixware version 6.1 was released on May 6, 2009. After OpenOffice Applix Inc. began to seek other software markets, leveraging the power of their scripting engine and flexible architecture to expand into business intelligence software markets such as OLAP. Applix focused its efforts in developing and its OLAP server TM1 shortly before it was acquired by Cognos in 2007, which was in turn acquired by IBM four months later. Applixware is often used in the industrial world as a means of developing large scale Unix and Linux applications and glueing together other applications. The Applixware unit of the company was renamed Vistasource, Inc. and sold to Parallax Capital partners in 2001. Vistasource now offers a freely available limited version for home users on Linux.

Rufaida Al-Aslamia is depicted as a kind, empathetic nurse and a good organizer. With her clinical skills, she trained other women, Including the famous female companions of Muhammad, Ayesha, to be nurses and to work in the area of health care. She also worked as a social worker, helping to solve social problems associated with the disease. In addition, she assisted children in need and took in orphans, and helped the poor. Familial Ties To Medicine Born into a family with strong ties to the medical community, Rufaida's father, Sa\`ad Al Aslamy, was a physician and mentor under whom Rufaida initially obtained clinical experience. Devoting herself to nursing and taking care of sick people, Rufaida Al-Aslamia became an expert healer. Although not given responsibilities held solely by men such as surgeries and amputations, Rufaida Al-Aslamia practiced her skills in field hospitals in her tent during many battles as Muhammad used to order all casualties to be carried to her tent so that she might treat them with medical expertise. It has also been documented that Rufaida provided care to injured soldiers during the jihad, as well as providing shelter from the wind and heat of the harsh desert for the dying.see Stars in the Prophet's Orbit by Asmaa Tabaa, translated by Sawsan Tarabishy for a short biography Historical Aspects of Female Nursing In Saudi Arabia=Pre-Islamic and Islamic Era (570‚Äì632 AD) Typically presented within the context of Muhammad, the historical development of female nursing and surgery in Arabia from the Islamic Period to the modern times boasts a tumultuous history laden with cultural barriers and public pressures.Miller-Rosser, K., Chapman, Y., Francis, K. (July 19, 2006): \\"Historical, Cultural, and Contemporary Influences on the Status of Women in Nursing in Saudi Arabia\\". OJIN: The Online Journal of Issues in Nursing. Vol. 11, No. 3. Though very sparse documentation exists pertaining to the history of nursing in the Pre-Islamic period, a proper understanding of societal and religious paradigms during the reign of Muhammad lends significant insight into the roles and expectation of nurses in antiquity. In marked contrast to the pervading Christian interpretation of disease as a divine punishment for man, Muslims place an extremely high value on the ritual cleansing of the body, daily prayer schedules, and strict dietary regiments. An era in history defined by a number of holy wars, medicinal treatment during the times of Muhammad was largely performed solely by doctors, who would personally visit the patient to diagnose abnormalities and provide medications to those who were in need. Placing the bulk of the biological and physiological responsibilities of a patient on the doctor alone, nurses were limited in their duties to providing physical comfort and emotional support. Front door of ancient hospital of Sal√© in Morocco designed by Islamic architects and managed by ancient Islamic physicians Post-Prophetic to Middle Ages Era (632‚Äì1500 AD) With the diminishing intensity of holy wars and mass civil unrest that defined the climate of Islamic culture during the reign of Muhammad, advancements in technology and architecture resulted in the construction of many new hospitals and methods for treating the sick. Though nurses in this period of time were still relegated to rudimentary and noninvasive duties like serving food to patients and administering medicinal liquids, religious and social norms of the times necessitated the segregation of hospital wards based on gender, with males treating males and females treating females.Donahue, M.P. (1985) Nursing: the finest art. An illustrated history. St Louis: Mosby. While there has been some relaxation of segregation in contemporary times, the values of many traditional Islamic people are for hospitals and their policies to reflect these past segregational practices.  Revolutions In Nursing Development =Rufaida Al-Aslamia's Emergence As Nursing Leader A charismatic and capable leader, published records testify that Rufaida Al- Aslamia, who practiced at the time of Muhammad, was the first Muslim nurse.Kasule, O. H. (2003). Historical roots of the nursing profession in Islam . Retrieved June 2004. While there is slight controversy in who is \\"technically\\" the first surgeon and nurse in history, Middle Eastern countries attribute the status of the first ever nurse to Rufaida, a Muslim surgeon and nurse.Jan, R. (1996). Rufaida Al-Asalmiya, the first Muslim nurse. Image: The Journal of Nursing Scholarship, 28(3), 267-268. Acute Care Origins Rufaida Al-Aslamia implemented her clinical skills and medical experience into developing the first ever documented mobile care units that were able to meet the medical needs of the community.El-Sanabary, N. (2003). \\"Women and the nursing profession in Saudi Arabia\\". In N. H. Bryant (Ed.), Women in nursing in Islamic societies. Pakistan: Oxford University Press. The scope of the majority of her work in her organized medical command units consisted primarily in hygiene and stabilizing patients prior to further and more invasive medical procedures. During military expeditions, Rufaida Al-Aslamia led groups of volunteer nurses who went to the battlefield and treated the casualties. She participated in the battles of Khandaq, Khaibar, and others. The Mosque at Salaman, location of the Battle of The Trench where Al-Aslamia treated the injured During times of peace, Rufaida Al-Aslamia continued her involvement with humanitarian efforts by providing assistance to Muslims who were in need. Legacy Rufaidah had trained a group of women companions as nurses. When Muhammad's army was getting ready to go to the battle of Khaibar, Rufaidah and the group of volunteer nurses went to Muhammad. They asked him for permission \\"O Messenger of Allah, we want to go out with you to the battle and treat the injured and help Muslims as much as we can\\". Muhammad gave them permission to go. The nurse volunteers did such a good job that Muhammad assigned a share of the bounty to Rufaidah. Her share was equivalent to that of soldiers who had actually fought. This was in recognition of her medical and nursing work. Rufaida Al-Aslamia Prize In Nursing Each year the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland at the University of Bahrain awards one student the coveted and prestigious Rufaida Al-Aslamia Prize in Nursing. The award winner determined by a panel of senior clinical medical staff members, the Rufaida Al-Aslamia Prize in Nursing is given to the student who consistently excels in delivering superb nursing care to patients.

Kaleidescape, Inc., 176 Cal. App. 4th 697 is a legal case heard by the California Court of Appeal concerning breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. It discusses incorporation by reference regarding a supplemental document that was not part of the written license agreement between the parties. The Court of Appeal reversed the trial court's judgment and ruled in favor of the plaintiff (DVD Copy Control Association), finding that defendant was bound to the entire contract, including the supplemental document. This case is also of interest in the realm of copyright law due to its tangential relationship to the issues of fair use and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. Background Kaleidescape, Inc., licensed the motion picture industry- supported digital rights management system, Content Scramble System (CSS), from the DVD Copy Control Association (DVD CCA) in order to provide a home entertainment server system that would allow a user to copy physical DVDs to a single persistent storage device. Once in the Kaleidescape system, the DVD content could be stored, organized, and played back at any time, without requiring access to the original DVDs. It would also allow users to make permanent copies of borrowed or rented DVDs. In particular, the Kaleidescape system would copy the CSS-encrypted files in their entirety from the DVDs using a \\"reader\\", which would then save the encrypted files to the \\"server\\". Playback would only be allowed via a licensed Kaleidescape \\"player\\". Trial Court Proceedings In 2004, DVD CCA sued Kaleidescape for breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. DVD CCA alleged that because the Kaleidescape system allowed its users to play previously-copied content without requiring the DVD to be in the machine at the time of playback, Kaleidescape violated the \\"CSS General Specifications\\" section of the license agreement. Under this particular licensing scheme, the licensee must sign a standard agreement to maintain confidentiality of the CSS technology. At the time of signing, the licensee is not aware of the particular specifications to which the licensee must comply (such as the specification that the original DVD must be inserted into the player at the time of playback). It is only after noting the \\"membership category\\", executing the agreement, and paying the required fees, will the licensee receive the \\"CSS General Specifications\\". Since it was found that the General Specifications were not clearly mentioned in the license, the trial court found that those terms were not properly incorporated by reference into the agreement. Thus, in the March 29, 2007 ruling for the case DVD Copy Control Association, Inc. v. Kaleidescape, Inc., No. 1-04-CV031829, (Superior Court of California, Santa Clara County), Judge Leslie C. Nichols ruled in favor of Kaleidescape, finding that Kaleidescape was in full compliance with the DVD CCA's CSS licensing scheme. In particular, it was found that the \\"CSS General Specifications\\" were not technically included as part of the license agreement. Although this case only addressed breach of contract and was not a copyright case, it was considered by some to be an important recent test of fair use precedent, since it circles the question of whether a consumer who has legally purchased a DVD can copy or backup that DVD to whatever end the consumer desires. Ruling of the Court of Appeal DVD CCA filed its opening brief in December 2007, appealing the lower court decision to the 6th District Court of Appeal. In August 2009, the Court of Appeal reversed the lower court decision, ruling that the \\"CSS General Specifications\\" were a part of the contract. The Court of Appeal did not decide whether Kaleidescape complied with them and instead ordered the trial court to determine any breach of contract. In March 2012, the trial court ruled that Kaleidescape had violated the terms of the contract, and an injunction was issued prohibiting them from selling or supporting the products in question. Discussions of Fair Use There were some fair use comments worthy of note in this case. Considered in the case were memos written by Kaleidescape's founders, including the reflection that enabling consumers to make permanent backups of DVDs would become \\"a value--loss proposition for content owners and rental businesses because there is no repeat business ever if everyone were to own [home video library] product. Rental business will die, and retail business will suffer because borrowing once to have a permanent copy forever seems too good to forego for the average consumer.‚Äù All three judges concurred, with Judge Rushing offering a separate opinion that addressed a bit more in the realm of fair use. Judge Rushing stated, \\"In my view, its product was clearly not designed or intended to facilitate the theft of intellectual property; nobody buys it for that purpose; and if it has that incidental effect, it is no worse in most respects--and better in others--than an ordinary personal computer with freely available DVD-copying software.\\" He further commented that, \\"The disk-in-machine clause is at most a contract term. It is not a moral imperative,\\" referencing the concern that such a system would enable a user to build an entire DVD library by merely copying rented or borrowed DVDs. Judge Rushing also noted that the features provided by the Kaleidescape system has \\"no more tendency to permit 'casual users' to engage in 'unauthorized copying'\\" than a (far less expensive) personal computer. Additionally, the Kaleidescape system only makes one copy to be stored within the system, and does not enable further duplications of that copy. He contrasted this with the capabilities of an equivalent system built on a personal computer, remarking that such a capability for collecting copies of DVDs had been around for years prior to the development of the Kaleidescape system.

Reimerdes and MGM v. 321 Studios addressed the legality of software used for decrypting CSS-encrypted DVDs, and which resulted in copies of the DVDs stored as unencrypted media files that required no licensing for later playback.

He was praefectus urbi in 414,, succeeding his friend Rutilius Namatianus, and possibly again in 426. Some authorities spell his name Caecina Decius Acinatius Albinus.  Biography  His father was probably Caecina Decius Albinus, and his grandfather Aginatius; Albinus was therefore a member of the Roman aristocracy related to the families of the Ceionii and the Decii. Caecina Decius Basilius, consul in 463, might be his son. Albinus was an associate of the poet Rutilius Claudius Namatianus, who described him as \\"a youth in the flower of life\\" (vitae flore puer), owning a villa near Namatianus at Volaterrae in modern Tuscany, having a son Rufius, and who was Namatianus' successor as praefectus urbi.De reditu suo I.167-171, 466-474. Translated by Harold Isbell, Last Poets of Imperial Rome (Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1971), pp. 225, 233f During his tenure as praefectus urbi, Albinus requested the emperor Honorius to increment the food reserved for the population of Rome, as it was increasing after the sack of Alaric in 410.Codex Theodosianus, XIII.5.38 Alan Cameron has argued that Albinus is identical to the \\"clarissimo Albino\\" the grammarian Servius dedicated his treatise on meter. If this is correct, it would strengthen Cameron's further identification of Albinus with the Decius who is mentioned near the beginning of the Saturnalia of Macrobius.Cameron, \\"The Date and Identity of Macrobius\\", Journal of Roman Studies, 56 (1966), p. 30 Ronald J. Weber points out that it is possible he was also the praefectus urbi Flavius Albinus attested in a 426 law preserved in the Codex Theodosianus, arguing that the 12-year gap is not a significant objection to this identification.Weber, \\"Albinus: The Living Memory of a Fifth-Century Personality\\", Historia: Zeitschrift f√ºr Alte Geschichte, 38 (1989), p. 484 If they are not the same person, then Albinus vanishes from the historical record after 414.

A runner was a military courier, a foot soldier responsible for carrying messages during war. Runners were very important to military communications, before telecommunications became commonplace. The Ancient Greek semi-historical character of Pheidippides is said to have been the runner bringing the news of the Greek victory over the Persians from Marathon to Athens in 490 BC.  20th century  Even though field telephones were widely used for the first time during World War I (1914‚Äì18), they relied on copper wire lines, which were often damaged or unreliable, or simply unavailable as troops advanced. Radio technology existed, but was generally regarded as too insecure for frontline use. Hence, most armies still made extensive use of runners. On battlefields dominated by automatic weapons and trench warfare, as well as the first widespread use of artillery and air attacks, runners faced one of the most dangerous jobs: they had to leave the relative safety of a trench, bunker or other shelter, and carry messages to other positions. For the same reasons, officers could not be sure that their message had been delivered until a runner returned to their unit. Runners were frequently decorated for bravery: for instance Adolf Hitler, who was a runner in the Bavarian Army during World War I, was wounded twice and received both the Iron Cross first class and second class during the war.

It was inspired by the obligate brood parasitism of some cuckoo species by laying their eggs in the nests of other host birds (of other species). Some host birds can engage direct conflict with the intruding cuckoos. For example, if a host bird discovers the eggs are not their own, it will either throw these alien eggs away or simply abandon its nest and build a new nest elsewhere. Some cuckoo species such as the New World brood-parasitic Tapera have evolved in such a way that female parasitic cuckoos are often very specialized in the mimicry in colors and pattern of the eggs of a few chosen host species.R. B. Payne, M. D. Sorenson, and K. Klitz, The Cuckoos, Oxford University Press, (2005). Cuckoo search idealized such breeding behavior, and thus can be applied for various optimization problems.  Metaphor  Cuckoo search (CS) uses the following representations: Each egg in a nest represents a solution, and a cuckoo egg represents a new solution. The aim is to use the new and potentially better solutions (cuckoos) to replace a not-so-good solution in the nests. In the simplest form, each nest has one egg. The algorithm can be extended to more complicated cases in which each nest has multiple eggs representing a set of solutions. CS is based on three idealized rules: # Each cuckoo lays one egg at a time, and dumps its egg in a randomly chosen nest; # The best nests with high quality of eggs will carry over to the next generation; # The number of available hosts nests is fixed, and the egg laid by a cuckoo is discovered by the host bird with a probability p_a \\\\in (0,1). In this case, the host bird can throw the egg away/abandon the nest, and build a completely new nest. In addition, Yang and Deb discovered that the random-walk style search is better performed by L√©vy flights rather than simple random walk.  Algorithm  The pseudo-code can be summarized as: Objective function: f(\\\\mathbf{x}), \\\\quad \\\\mathbf{x}=(x_1,x_2,\\\\dots,x_d); \\\\, Generate an initial population of n host nests; While (tF_i [For maximization, F_i \\\\propto f(\\\\mathbf{x}_i) ]; Choose a nest among n (say, j) randomly; if (F_i>F_j ), Replace j by the new solution; end if A fraction (p_a) of the worse nests are abandoned and new ones are built; Keep the best solutions/nests; Rank the solutions/nests and find the current best; Pass the current best solutions to the next generation; end while An important advantage of this algorithm is its simplicity. In fact, comparing with other population- or agent-based metaheuristic algorithms such as particle swarm optimization and harmony search, there is essentially only a single parameter p_a in CS (apart from the population size n). Therefore, it is very easy to implement. Random walks and the step size  An important issue is the applications of L√©vy flights and random walks in the generic equation for generating new solutions : \\\\mathbf{x}_{t+1}=\\\\mathbf{x}_t + s E_t, where E_t is drawn from a standard normal distribution with zero mean and unity standard deviation for random walks, or drawn from L√©vy distribution for L√©vy flights. Obviously, the random walks can also be linked with the similarity between a cuckoo's egg and the host's egg which can be tricky in implementation. Here the step size s determines how far a random walker can go for a fixed number of iterations. The generation of L√©vy step size is often tricky, and a comparison of three algorithms (including Mantegna'sR. N. Mantegna, Fast, accurate algorithm for numerical simulation of L√©vy stable stochastic processes, Physical Review E, Vol.49, 4677-4683 (1994).) was performed by LeccardiM. Leccardi, Comparison of three algorithms for Levy noise generation, Proceedings of fifth EUROMECH nonlinear dynamics conference (2005). who found an implementation of Chambers et al.'s approach to be the most computationally efficient due to the low number of random numbers required. If s is too large, then the new solution generated will be too far away from the old solution (or even jump outside of the bounds). Then, such a move is unlikely to be accepted. If s is too small, the change is too small to be significant, and consequently such search is not efficient. So a proper step size is important to maintain the search as efficient as possible. As an example, for simple isotropic random walks, we know that the average distance r traveled in the d-dimension space is : r^2=2 d D t, where D=s^2/2\\\\tau is the effective diffusion coefficient. Here s is the step size or distance traveled at each jump, and \\\\tau is the time taken for each jump. The above equation implies thatX.-S. Yang, Nature-Inspired Metaheuristic Algorithms, 2nd Edition, Luniver Press, (2010). : s^2=\\\\frac{\\\\tau \\\\; r^2}{t \\\\; d}. For a typical length scale L of a dimension of interest, the local search is typically limited in a region of r=L/10 . For \\\\tau=1 and t=100 to 1000, we have s\\\\approx 0.01L for d=1, and s \\\\approx 0.001L for d=10. Therefore, we can use s/L=0.001 to 0.01 for most problems. Though the exact derivation may require detailed analysis of the behaviour of L√©vy flights.M. Gutowski, L√©vy flights as an underlying mechanism for global optimization algorithms, ArXiv Mathematical Physics e-Prints, June, (2001). Algorithm and convergence analysis will be fruitful, because there are many open problems related to metaheuristicsX. S. Yang, Metaheuristic optimization: algorithm analysis and open problems, in: Experimental Algorithms (SEA2011), Eds (P. M. Pardalos and S. Rebennack), LNCS 6630, pp.21-32 (2011).  Theoretical analysis  As significant efforts, theoretical analyses are required to improve performances of CS-base algorithms: # Theoretical analysis on convergence of CS-based algorithms # Providing the sufficient and necessary conditions for the control parameter settings # Employing non-homogeneous search rules to enhance the classical CS algorithm Improved Cuckoo Search Algorithms  Convergence of Cuckoo Search algorithm can be substantially improved by genetically replacing abandoned nests (instead of using the random replacements from the original method).

He served as a member of the Parliament of Fiji from 1999 to 2001. 2000 coup and aftermath Rinakama was elected to Parliament in the 1999 election, representing the constituency of Naitasiri for the Fijian Association Party. During the 2000 Fijian coup d'√©tat, he joined the Cabinet of George Speight. As a result, he was refused entry to New Zealand in 2003 due to his involvement in the coup. Following the coup, he switched his allegiance to the Conservative Alliance, but failed to win re-election in the 2001 election. In 2003, he alleged that the Soqosoqo ni Vakavulewa ni Taukei (SVT) party was behind the 2000 coup, and that it had plotted to overthrow the government of Mahendra Chaudhry even before it took office. Shortly afterwards he was charged with taking an unlawful oath for purporting to join Speight's Cabinet, and in 2004 he was convicted and sentenced to three years imprisonment. He was granted early release for good behaviour in December 2005, having served half his sentence. In 2005 it was alleged that Rinakama had benefitted from a US$13 million fraud in the agriculture ministry in 2001. Assassination plot In November 2007, Rinakama was one of ten people arrested and charged with conspiring to assassinate Fijian dictator Frank Bainimarama. All charges against him were withdrawn in December of that year. Disappearance On 5 March 2010 Rinakama was abducted by soldiers from a house in Suva. He has not been seen since, and there are fears he has been disappeared. On 11 March 2010, the Fijian government admitted that Rinakama was in custody, though they would not say where or what for. On 12 March, they claimed he had been released. Despite this, he has not been seen by family or friends, and there are significant fears for his safety.

It is the third Haryanavi-language film to be released and the first financially successful one. Written by Late. Shri Devi Shankar Prabhakar, produced by Usha Sharma and directed by Jayant Prabhaker, the film's music was arranged by J. P. Kaushik. Starring dancer Usha Sharma, the film tells the story of a tragic love affair between Chandrawal, a girl of the Gadia Lohar community, and Suraj, a haryanavi Jat Boy. It was released in March 1984 and became very successful, spurred on by a popular soundtrack. A sequel is in development and will be produced by Usha Sharma and directed by Nishant Prabhakar. Plot Chandrawal (Usha Sharma) is the grand daughter of the head of Gadia Lohar tribe, Jodha Sardar. Their gypsy tribe is proud of their heritage that they are the descendants of Maharana Pratap. They believe that after his defeat, their ancestors left Chittoor with the pledge that they would never settle down at a permanent place under roof till they again hoist Maharanas flag at Chitoor fort, and since then the tribe has been roaming about as gypsies, doing Lohars jobs for the people with great honesty and hard work. They never allow their girls to marry the boys of other castes. During their unending journey, Jodha Sardar was camping near Ram Garh village and here the young Jaat boy Suraj (Jagat Jakhar) first saw Chanrdrawal dancing at a marriage ceremony in the camp. Both the young hearts fell in love at first sight. The love affair becomes an open secret soon and Ranjit Chaudhary the father of Suraj who is also the village Chaudhary becomes very angry. On the other hand, Jodha Sardar also reacts very strongly and decides to leave the village at once as he does not like that Chandrawal and Suraj are given any chance to meet. He, before leaving the haveli of Chaudhary Ranjit, warns Suraj that if ultimately with the help of his friends he succeeds in finding out the place of his camp. On seeing Chandrawal after a long time, Suraj becomes so emotional that he runs towards the Dera crying - Chandra. Chandrawal also sees him and immediately rushes towards him without caring for the warnings of her grandfather that he would cut her into pieces with a long knife. At the same time Suraj sees Jodha Sardar throwing a knife to kill Chandrawal. Suraj at once turns himself to the side and takes the fatal attack on Chandrawal upon himself. Realising that Suraj is dead, Chandrawal snatches the knife out of the body of her lover and sacrifices herself there and then.\\"Film Database Movie Details\\" Cast * Nasib Singh Kundu - Roondah * Jagat Jakhar - Suraj Dahiya * Usha Sharma - Chandrawal * Daryav Singh Malik - Khoondah * Manphool Chand Dangi - Jodha Sardar Box office It broke multiple box office records and was most successful in Haryana, Western U.P., Delhi and parts of Rajasthan, grossing more than Hindi films like Sholay and Bobby in these areas.

It also occurs in New Caledonia and Lord Howe Island. The genus is derived from the Greek, dryppa meaning \\"olive fruit\\". The species named after Dr. Emile Deplanche, who collected this plant at New Caledonia. Common names include yellow tulip, grey boxwood, white myrtle, grey bark and yellow tulipwood.  Distribution and habitat  Occurring as far south as the Hunter River, New South Wales, north to Torres Strait across the Top End of the Northern Territory and The Kimberley in Western Australia. The subspecies affinis is endemic to Lord Howe Island. The habitat varies, but it is often found in monsoon forest, drier rainforest, as well as littoral rainforest, and rainforest by streams.  Description  Flowers and foliage A small to medium-sized tree, up to 25 metres tall and a stem width of 60 cm. The tree is often flanged at the butt and lower part of the trunk. Grey or brown bark, often with scales of bark which fall, leaving shallow depressions. This results in a mottled appearance, similar to the tulipwood. Bark scaly and pustular on older trees. Small branches smooth, slender, grey in colour. Dotted with many lenticels.  Leaves  Elliptical, ovate to ovate-oblong in shape, 4 to 9 cm long, 1 to 5 cm wide. Wavy edged, stiff, thick. Margins toothed, without teeth or with scalloped margins. Leaves abruptly tapered at the base, with a leaf tip or rounded at the end. Hairless and glossy green, somewhat paler green underneath. Leaf stems 3 to 6 mm long. Juvenile leaves prominently toothed. Leaf veins easily noticed, raised on both sides of the leaf. Five to seven lateral veins, at around 65 degrees to the midrib.  Flowers and fruit  Yellow brown flowers form in November, from the forks of the leaves. Male and female flowers on separate trees. Individual flowers around 4 mm in diameter. Male flowers in axillary racemes with a perianth around 2 mm long, with 5 to 10 stamens. Female flowers solitary or in clusters of 3 or 4.

Filippenko and Jay M. Pasachoff Some physicists, such as Lawrence Krauss, Stephen Hawking or Alexander Vilenkin, call or called this state \\"a universe from nothingness\\" but, the zero-energy universe model requires both a matter field with positive energy and a gravitational field with negative energy to exist. Christopher Isham, ‚ÄúQuantum Cosmology and the Origin of the Universe,‚Äù lecture presented at the conference ‚ÄúCosmos and Creation,‚Äù Cambridge University, 14 July 1994. Christopher Isham, a British quantum cosmologist, points out that there still needs to be ‚Äúontic seeding‚Äù to produce the positive and negative energy in the first place, even if on balance its sum is zero. History During WWII, Pascual Jordan first suggested that since the positive energy of a star's mass and the negative energy of its gravitational field together may have zero total energy, conservation of energy would not prevent a star being created by a quantum transition of the vacuum. George Gamow recounted putting this idea to Albert Einstein: \\"Einstein stopped in his tracks and, since we were crossing a street, several cars had to stop to avoid running us down\\".Beyond Einstein: The Cosmic Quest for the Theory of the Universe - Michio Kaku, Jennifer Trainer Thompson - Oxford University Press, 1997 - p189 Elaboration of the concept was slow, with the first notable calculation being performed by Richard Feynman in 1962. The first known publication on the topic was in 1973, when Edward Tryon proposed in the journal Nature that the universe emerged from a large-scale quantum fluctuation of vacuum energy, resulting in its positive mass-energy being exactly balanced by its negative gravitational potential energy. In the subsequent decades, development of the concept was constantly plagued by the dependence of the calculated masses on the selection of the coordinate systems. In particular, a problem arises due to energy associated with coordinate systems co-rotating with the entire universe. A first constraint was derived in 1987 when Alan Guth published a proof of gravitational energy being negative to matter associated mass-energy.Alan Guth, in his book The Inflationary Universe, () Appendix A Since the negative energy of a gravitational field is crucial to the notion of a zero-energy universe, it is a subject worth examining carefully. In this appendix I will explain how the properties of gravity can be used to show that the energy of a gravitational field is unambiguously negative. The argument will be described [in the appendix] in the context of Newton's theory of gravity, although the same conclusion can be reached using Einstein's theory of general relativity. The question of the mechanism permitting generation of both positive and negative energy from null initial solution was not understood, and an ad hoc solution with cyclic time was proposed by Stephen Hawking in 1988.Stephen Hawking, A Brief History of Time, p. 129. \\"We might decide that there wasn't any singularity. The point is that the raw material doesn't really have to come from anywhere. When you have strong gravitational fields, they can create matter. It may be that there aren't really any quantities which are constant in time in the universe. The quantity of matter is not constant, because matter can be created or destroyed. But we might say that the energy of the universe would be constant, because when you create matter, you need to use energy. And in a sense the energy of the universe is constant; it is a constant whose value is zero. The positive energy of the matter is exactly balanced by the negative energy of the gravitational field. So the universe can start off with zero energy and still create matter. Obviously, the universe starts off at a certain time. Now you can ask: what sets the universe off. There doesn't really have to be any beginning to the universe. It might be that space and time together are like the surface of the Earth, but with two more dimensions, with degrees of latitude playing the role of time.\\" -- Stephen Hawking, \\"If There's an Edge to the Universe, There Must Be a God\\" (interview), in Ren√©e Weber, Dialogues With Scientists and Sages: The Search for Unity, 1986. (Also partially reprinted in \\"God as the Edge of the Universe\\", in The Scientist, Vol. 1, No. 7, February 23, 1987, p. 15.) In 1994, development of the theory resumed following the publication of a work by Nathan Rosen, in which Rosen described a special case of closed universe. In 1995, J.V. Johri demonstrated that the total energy of Rosen\`s universe is zero in any universe compliant with a Friedmann‚ÄìLema√Ætre‚ÄìRobertson‚ÄìWalker metric, and proposed a mechanism of inflation-driven generation of matter in a young universe. The zero energy solution for Minkowski space representing an observable universe, was provided in 2009. Experimental constraints Experimental proof for observable universe being \\"zero-energy universe\\" is currently inconclusive. Gravitational energy from visible matter accounts to 26‚Äì37% of the observed total mass-energy density, therefore to fit the concept of \\"zero-energy universe\\" to observed universe, other negative energy reservoirs besides gravity from baryonic matter are necessary. These reservoirs are frequently assumed to be a dark matter. Relation to quantum fluctuation Although the hypothesis that a zero-energy universe was born out of a quantum fluctuation (vacuum genesis) is not consistent with modern physics as of 2015, [better source needed] this hypothesis is still widely cited in popular sources.Edward P. Tryon, \\"Is the Universe a Vacuum Fluctuation?\\", Nature, vol. 246, p.396‚Äì397, 1973.Berkeley Lab, Smoot Group - http://aether.lbl.gov - Inflation for Beginners, JOHN GRIBBIN \\"Quantum uncertainty allows the temporary creation of bubbles of energy, or pairs of particles (such as electron-positron pairs) out of nothing, provided that they disappear in a short time. The less energy is involved, the longer the bubble can exist. Curiously, the energy in a gravitational field is negative, while the energy locked up in matter is positive. If the universe is exactly flat, then as Tryon pointed out the two numbers cancel out, and the overall energy of the universe is precisely zero. In that case, the quantum rules allow it to last forever.\\" archived, 2014 See also * * False vacuum References Category:Physical cosmology ","title":"Zero-energy universe"},{"id":"26499569","text":"Ashton National Football Club was an English football club from Ashton-under- Lyne, Lancashire which played in the Cheshire County League in the 1920s and 1930s. They were sometimes also known as Ashton National Gas due to their connections with the National Gas and Oil Engine Company based in the town. History Ashton National joined the Cheshire County League in 1920, finishing 12th in their first season. They were third the following season and in both the 1926‚Äì27 and 1928‚Äì29 seasons. They remained in the Cheshire League until the Second World War ended competitive football, including finishing 2nd in the East Section in 1939. When football resumed after the war, Ashton National did not reappear. They played in the Manchester Premier Cup, winning it in 1937, 1940 and 1945 and were runners-up in 1936. In December 1932, Ashton National hosted what is thought to be the United Kingdom's first properly floodlit match, playing Hyde United in an exhibition match. Stadium The club played at National Park, Katherine Street, Ashton. The ground was taken over in the 1970s by Curzon Ashton. Curzon moved to the nearby Tameside Stadium in 2005 and the site of National Park is now a housing estate. Players Although a non-league side, in 1932, Ashton National, funded by the National Gas and Oil Engine Company which was based in the town, signed Scotland international Alex Jackson from First Division Chelsea. His move to Ashton was based on the fact that while they could pay Jackson ¬£15 a week, Chelsea as a Football League club were bound by rules of a maximum wage of ¬£8 per week. Other notable players included former Port Vale and West Bromwich Albion forward Bobby Blood, former Chesterfield and later Manchester United forward Samuel Hopkinson, former Huddersfield Town and Birmingham City forward Ernie Islip, former Bolton Wanderers forward Jimmy Currier, former Brighton & Hove Albion and Swansea Town forward Jack Cheetham, and Fred Smith the former Stockport County player who later played for Darlington, Exeter City and Gillingham. Australian goalkeeper Walter Cornock also played for Ashton National, later playing in the Football League for Oldham Athletic and Rochdale and also playing county cricket for Leicestershire. George Capper, a Manchester United player in the Wartime League & a National Gas Employee played for Ashton National in the 1950s after serving five years in the Army ( personal testimony ).

In the final on May 29, he came 11th with his song \\"Lost and Forgotten\\". Personal Info Peter Nalitch was born on 30 April 1981 in Moscow, Russia. His grandfather Zahid Naliƒá, was a Bosnian opera singer from Tuzla, Bosnia and Herzegovina. Peter graduated from the Moscow University of Architecture (MARHI) and studied music at Orfei Studio directed by Irina Mukhina. He has worked for two years as an architect. He has a son from his first marriage and a daughter from the second. \\"Gitar\\" Peter Nalitch has become famous in Russia after the publication in 2007 on YouTube of the clip of his song \\"Gitar\\" (where he makes fun of himself with broken English lyrics and dubious film editing qualities). In about three years, more than 4,000,000 people had watched it. Interviews and articles about Peter followed in some Russian papers. The song \\"Gitar\\" is most popular in Greece, Germany and Slovakia. Peter Nalitch and Friends Peter Nalitch on stage Peter Nalitch's musical collective Peter Nalitch (centre) Beginnings In 2007, Peter already had about 40 songs written down, all available on his website for free. Fans archived them, they can still be found on the web. It is with these songs that Peter gave his first concert, on November 9, 2007, in the club \\"Apshu\\" (\\"–ê–ø—à—É\\") in Moscow. After the success of this first concert (a lot of people had been unable to enter the first crowded venue), articles were written on blogs and in newspapers. Peter then gathered a band of musicians, with whom he gave two more concerts during the winter of 2008 in the club \\"IKRA\\" (\\"–ò–∫—Ä–∞\\"), in Moscow. Tickets were sold out several months before the event. The band took the name Peter Nalitch's Musical Collective - \\"Muzykalny kollektiv Petra Nalitcha\\" (\\"–ú—É–∑—ã–∫–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã–π –∫–æ–ª–ª–µ–∫—Ç–∏–≤ –ü–µ—Ç—Ä–∞ –ù–∞–ª–∏—á–∞\\") or more simply \\"MKPN\\" (\\"–ú–ö–ü–ù\\"). Success Over the following two years, in addition to the Moscow venues, MKPN went on tour, performing in Saint Petersburg, Yekaterinburg, Nizhny Novgorod and other large Russian cities. The band released their first album in 2008 - \\"Radost Prostykh Melody\\" (\\"–†–∞–¥–æ—Å—Ç—å –ø—Ä–æ—Å—Ç—ã—Ö –º–µ–ª–æ–¥–∏–π\\" - translated as \\"The Joy of Simple Melodies\\" on their website).

In 2009, the band was one of the headliners at the \\"Sfinks\\" festival in Antwerp (Belgium). Nalitch is self-produced. Eurovision 2010 Peter Nalitch and Friends was chosen to represent Russia in the Eurovision Song Contest 2010, in Oslo, with the song Lost and Forgotten. The final, on May 29, saw the song finishing 11th. Musical style Peter Nalitch on stage Peter Nalitch sings in Russian, English (the latter with a Russian accent, which he refuses to hide), Italian (\\"Santa Lucia\\"), French (\\"Il pleut toujours\\", on the EP \\"More\\") and Baburi, an invented language. The lyrics of his songs are often humorous and can sometimes be compared to child songs (\\"Yeti\\" - ¬´–ô–µ—Ç–∏¬ª, is a song about a lonely yeti). MKPN also did covers of Russian romances and Cossack songs. All albums and songs are available for free on the band's official website, with the mention \\"Pay what you will\\", even though the album and the EP have been released. Peter Nalitch had declared in an interview that they were not really making money from album sales, only from the concerts given in Russia. In the wake of this idea of self-promotion on the web, the band has given, on September 17, 2009, an acoustic concert from their own flat, broadcast live on RuTube (a local videohosting and live broadcasting site). On October 30, 2009, they broadcast another show live on RuTube, this time a real concert in Moscow.

Written by Ranjith and directed by Shaji Kailas. Plot Vishwanathan (Suresh Gopi), due to his passion for farming and agriculture, gave up his job in an MNC and has been settled in his village. One day he gets a call from Hyderabad that Revathi (Maathu), his sister, who is studying medicine at a medical college has been missing for the past couple of days. Vishwanathan sets out to Hyderabad on the same day in a tourist bus. The bus, which is on a trip to Tirupati, is packed with a set of religious Tamil-speaking Hindu pilgrims. Gowri (Annie), a beautiful girl among them grabs his attention for her singing abilities. The next day morning, on reaching Hyderabad, Vishwanathan reaches the college, and from her friends comes to know that Revathi had received threats from one Sudhakar Reddy (K. B. Ganesh Kumar), son of an underworld don,Govinda Reddy. Revathi, who had witnessed a murder committed by Sudhakar, had planned to appear at an identification parade at the police station. Sudhkar in fury, rapes her, and in an effort to save herself, she falls down from the top of a building and dies. Vishwanathan visits the nearby police station to file a complaint, but gets cold response from the local inspector. He even threatens to arrest Vishwanathan, if he decides to move ahead with the complaint. Vishwanathan, who goes crazy of anger, gets into a scuffle with Sudhakar, and kills him, which causes his father Reddy, who is now ruling the city, to hunt for Vishwanathan. He is saved by the rival mafia don Patel (Devan). Vishwanathan is made to stay at a brothel run by Patel, where he meets Appu (Maniyanpilla Raju), a good hearted chap. At the brothel, he is shocked to see Gowri, with whom he had a crush on the bus on the road to Hyderabad. From Appu, he comes to know that she was trapped and kidnapped at Tirupathi and has been sold to Patel by a lady pimp (Lalithasree). On meeting Vishwanathan, Gowri pleads him to save her. At night, she hits the CI Rao with a liquor bottle, causing him injury. Vishwanathan decides to save her and is helped by Appu in finding a route outside. Appu introduces him to Jose (Vijayaraghavan), a truck driver from Kerala and his sidekick Kunjahammed (Augustine). But Appu is killed by the goons of Patel. Vishwanathan flees out from the brothel with Gowri and is followed by Patel and his goons. On other side, Reddy is also after him. Their chase turns more violent as they face several hardships on the path, including many local criminals. But Vishwanathan, after a bloody, long chase, succeeds in saving her by killing both Patel and Reddy.

It has been rumored by TgCom that the band are working with Thomas Black (You're a Star Ireland and A&R; man for Sony/EMI Records) with regards to publishing their music worldwide, but for now they are working within Italy and most recently started work with Solomasagio, based in Milan.

Teoh Beng Hock (20 April 1979 ‚Äì 1 July 2009) was a Malaysian journalist and political aide to Ean Yong Hian Wah, a member of the Selangor state legislative assembly and state executive council. On 1 July 2009, the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) took Teoh into custody for questioning about allegations of corruption. Teoh was found dead the next morning on the rooftop of a building adjacent to the MACC offices. Pakatan Rakyat leaders and a number of federal government officials have called for a Royal Commission of inquiry into Teoh's death. Family Teoh was the third child of Teoh Leong Hwee (born 1953). He had an elder brother; Teoh Beng Kee (Chinese: ËµµÈì≠Âü∫) (born 1976), elder sister; Teoh Lee Jun (Chinese: Ëµµ‰∏ΩÂêõ) and a younger sister; Teoh Lee Lan (1980,Chinese: Ëµµ‰∏ΩÂÖ∞). His father was a taxi driver, and his mother, Teng Shuw Hor (1953) is a housewife. Teoh was engaged to 28-year-old teacher Soh Cher Wei after a two- year courtship, and had been planning to register his marriage with her the day following his death. A photo shoot on the same day, followed by a honeymoon and wedding reception in October had also been planned. At the time of Teoh's death, Soh was two months pregnant; she told the press she intended to keep the child. National Registration Department regulations only allow a father's name to be included on the birth certificate if he is physically present at the time of birth; after this was publicised through the press, Women, Family and Community Development Minister Shahrizat Abdul Jalil said she would ask the NRD to look into the matter. Shahrizat also stated her ministry would assist in transferring Soh from her current school to one closer to her hometown, and look into assisting Teoh's family since he was their sole breadwinner. Prime Minister Najib Tun Razak later met with Teoh's family to express his condolences. Najib told them he would direct the Attorney-General and relevant government departments to look into Teoh's family's wish that his child bear the Teoh surname. On 15 August 2009, Soh completed the traditional Chinese marriage ceremonies, together with Teoh Lee Lan, Beng Hock's younger sister, acting as a proxy. Kerk Kim Hock, a distant uncle of Teoh and the family's acting spokesperson, told the press that completion of the marriage rites now entitled Soh to have her name engraved on Teoh's gravestone as his wife.  Sequence of events  MACC officials claimed that the interrogation had lasted for about 9 hours. According to the MACC also, Teoh was freed at 3.45am‚Äîhowever without proper explanation, his possessions, including his mobile phone, remained in MACC custody. MACC officials also claimed that Teoh asked to stay the night at the MACC office, and was claimed to be last seen alive around 6am. Teoh was found dead at 1.30pm later in the day. The investigation had been into allegations that Ean Yong had paid RM2,400 for flags to be used in Merdeka Day celebrations, but not taken delivery of the flags. Teoh's colleagues who had also been questioned claimed that they were put under pressure from MACC officers, including being denied access to legal counsel and food or drink. Teoh's mobile phone was still in the possession of MACC officials when he was found dead at 1.30pm despite the MACC's claims that Teoh was released at 3.45am. The mobile phone was later handed to the police for investigation. One of Teoh's colleagues, Tan Boon Wah, later filed suit against the MACC for false imprisonment. In the case, Tan Boon Wah v. Datuk Seri Ahmad Said Hamdan, Ketua Suruhanjaya, Suruhanjaya Pencegahan Rasuah Malaysia and Others, the High Court ruled that because Tan was interrogated after normal working hours, he had been subject to false imprisonment, and ordered the MACC to pay him damages. Tan's lawyer, Karpal Singh, said that Teoh's family could also sue the MACC for damages, citing this ruling. Democratic Action Party Parliamentary leader and former Opposition Leader Lim Kit Siang lamented that \\"Teoh Beng Hock would not have died if MACC had followed the law\\" and interrogated him during the day. Teoh's family and others have called the MACC's version of events into question. When the investigating officer involved briefed the MACC's advisory board, several members of the board \\"asked why he chose to stay back. Any detainee would have run for his life! The investigating officer replied that since Teoh wanted to stay back, he allowed it.\\" During this briefing it also emerged that no official records of Teoh's detention or his release existed. In August, a video of men in uniform assaulting a man in their custody began circulating as a supposed video of Teoh's interrogation. The Bukit Aman federal police headquarters denied the men were police personnel. The video had previously been circulated in June as a supposed example of police interrogation techniques, ruling out the possibility of it involving Teoh. A political observer attributed the video's popularity to the government's failing to provide adequate clarification about the circumstances of Teoh's interrogation: \\"The authorities are shedding little light about what happened to Teoh. This allows rumour mongers to spread ridiculous things.\\"  Response to death  Some lawyers have argued that the law does not authorise the MACC to hold witnesses in custody, and that since Teoh was not a suspect, he should not have been held in custody. The Malaysian Human Rights Commission (SUHAKAM) called the duration of Teoh's questioning \\"inhumane and cruel.\\" The president of the Bar Council, K. Ragunath, said the MACC had contravened the Federal Constitution by denying Teoh legal counsel during questioning, as well as the Lockup Rules 1953, which require all detainees to be locked up between 6.30pm and 6.30am to rest. Ragunath called Teoh's interrogation tantamount to torture. Ean Yong's lawyer insisted that as \\"Teoh's movement was restricted, this amounts to an arrest,\\" despite the MACC's insistence that Teoh was only a voluntary witness. Mohamad Ramli Manan, a senior official who retired from the Anti-Corruption Agency (before it became the MACC), agreed: Another former ACA official, Abdul Razak Idris, disputed Ramli's view of the interrogation process, saying: \\"The Act provides that we can interview anytime. Investigators are supposed to work 24 hours.\\" In response to calls from civil society and political leaders for a Royal Commission, Deputy Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin stated the Cabinet would consider setting up a Royal Commission of inquiry. Initial police findings suggested foul play was not involved in Teoh's death, but his friends and relatives insisted Teoh had not committed suicide, pointing to the fact that he was to be married, and that his fiance was pregnant. Teoh's family lawyers claimed that during questioning by the police, his family had been asked questions suggesting that they were primarily interested in \\"[absolving] MACC officers from liability\\" by pursuing the possibility of a suicide. A week after Teoh's death, his family vigorously insisted there was no possibility he had killed himself: \\"Teoh was joyful and had no problems at work. Teoh had no financial issues, got along well with everyone and was preparing for his wedding.\\" One detail which seemed to strike the police was Teoh's shoes; when his body was discovered, his shoes were apparently significantly damaged and worn. Teoh's fiancee \\"said that Teoh had several pairs and seldom changed them unless they were damaged, but on that fateful day, he wore a new pair.\\" The United Malays National Organisation (UMNO)-owned newspaper Berita Harian published an op-ed by New Straits Times Press managing editor Zainul Ariffin Isa criticising the response to Teoh's death, stating that criticisms of the MACC were an attempt to undermine Malay institutions. Zainul was particularly critical of Selangor Menteri Besar Khalid Ibrahim for his criticism of the MACC officers' handling of the case, saying it was not right for Khalid to question \\"those of the same race as him.\\" At the weekly Malaysian Cabinet meeting on 22 July following Teoh's death, the Cabinet transferred all MACC officers involved in the probe of graft allegations against the Selangor government to other assignments, pending the official police inquiry. The Cabinet also decided to establish a Royal Commission of inquiry into the MACC's interrogation procedures, but not Teoh's death, allowing the standard inquest to pursue the matter.  Royal Commission of inquiry  In a joint statement, Pakatan Rakyat leaders called the Royal Commission's terms of reference insufficient, saying that the \\"question [of how Teoh died] cannot be separated from the more general issue of how the MACC conducts investigations.\\" The Pakatan Rakyat statement insisted that the Commission probe the following questions: Robert Phang, a member of the MACC advisory board, suggested that \\"Though the royal commission's scope is wide, it can be opened up further to dig deeper into issues not cleared by the inquest,\\" such as establishing a reason for Teoh's death. Also being investigated is a mystery letter written on the letterhead of MACC, alleging MACC, Hishamuddin bin Hashim was involved with the torture of Teoh Beng Hock and former Menteri Besar Khir Toyo had prior knowledge of it. The Royal Commission of Inquiry concluded that Teoh was not murdered but had committed suicide due to the aggressive interrogation tactics by three MACC officers. Teoh's family have rejected the RCI's findings and insisted that Teoh was murdered. The Bar Council of Malaysia have also questioned the RCI's findings. A coalition of 126 NGOs have called the Commission's findings a whitewash as it did not address the concerns regarding the interrogation methods by the MACC. Prime Minister Najib Tun Razak has defended the RCI's findings and called on all quarters not to question the findings. The Malay daily Utusan Malaysia, which is owned by UMNO, defended the MACC and blamed DAP for Teoh's death. The three MACC officers involved in interrogating Teoh have been suspended pending an investigation by the police.  Further developments  On 10 February 2012, Teoh Meng Kee, Beng Hock‚Äôs elder brother filed an application at the Court of Appeal to review the open verdict stating that Teoh Beng Hock committed suicide delivered by the Coroner‚Äôs Court in 2011, after his application was rejected by the High Court on 1 December 2011. The Court of Appeal on 5 September 2014 set aside the open verdict stating that \\"a person or persons were responsible\\" for Teoh's death. See also *Kugan Ananthan *Tan Boon Wah v.

He treated wounded soldiers of the both sides equally in the Satsuma rebellion (1877) which was fought between Satsuma and the new Imperial Government. He faced a trial for trying to benefit the enemy, but was proved innocent. His activities were in accord with the spirit of International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement. S≈çha Hatono VIII of Japan *He was born to a family of physicians in Kumamoto, Kyushu, Japan in 1844. Souha Hatono I (1641‚Äì1697) was said to sail to Netherlands without permission and studied medicine. Souda Hatono VII studied surgery of Hanaoka school of Hanaoka Seish≈´ and taught medicine at the family's private school. S≈çha Hatono VIII was the son of S≈çha Hatono VII and was given an award for treating 300 wounded soldiers at the Battle of Ueno in 1868 in Tokyo. Satsuma Rebellion *In 1877, a civil war broke between the Government and Satsuma which had dissatisfaction of the new Imperial Government, and Kumamoto became the battlefield. Hatono was violently demanded to treat the wounded soldiers of the Satsuma army, but he replied that the request was accepted on the condition that soldiers of the both sides, as well as citizens, were treated equally on February 23, 1877. The Satsuma leaders accepted the condition. He immediately opened hospitals with the physicians of the Kumamoto Province and hospitalized 200 persons at schools, temples and private houses. Later, Hatono was tried for possibly benefiting the enemy by the Government temporal court, but he was freed without sentence three days later. A document left in his house indicated that Hatono had no intention of benefiting the enemy and we will not examine his activities further. Forerunners of the Red Cross *Hatono's activities were in accord with the spirit of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement.  Ryoun Takamatsu  *At the time of the Battle of Hakodate (1868‚Äì1869), Ryou-un Takamatsu treated both sides equally; the remnants of the Tokugawa shogunate army, and the armies of the newly formed Imperial government (composed mainly of forces of the Ch≈çsh≈´ and the Satsuma domains). Sano Tsunetami In May, 1877, Sano Tsunetami created the Hakuaisha, a relief organization to provide medical assistance to soldiers wounded in the Satsuma Rebellion. This organization became the Japanese Red Cross Society in 1887, with Sano as its first president. Why was Hatono not appreciated ? *It was apparent that the activities of Hatono were the forerunners of the Red Cross in Japan. The first appeal for the establishment of the Hakuaisha (which later became Japan Red Cross) was made on May 1, 1977 by Sano Tsunetami and the day of the establishment of the Japan Red Cross is May 1, while the start of the activities was on May 3, at Shonenji Temple, Gyokuto-son, Tamanagun, Kumamoto. On the contrary, Hatono started his activities on February 23, at the Umekiko of Takahira, Shimizu, Kumamoto. According to the following newspaper, it was because his activities were not reported to the central government.Sen-yu Shimbun, on August 1, 1970. *In 1998, \\"a nonprofit organization in honor of the place of the origin of the Red Cross activities\\" was approved in Kumamoto.

This was funded from taxes collected on clerical incomes which were in turn funded by tithes. The board was replaced in 1833 by the Board of Ecclesiastical Commissioners. History From the English Reformation in the 16th century, most Irish people chose to remain Roman Catholic and had by now to pay tithes valued at about 10% of an area's agricultural produce, to maintain and fund the established state church, the Anglican Church of Ireland, to which only a small minority of the population converted. Protests against this situation led to the Tithe war in the early 19th century. In 1711, Queen Anne agreed that the tax on clerical incomes be given to the Church of Ireland for the building of new churches and Glebe Houses. To that effect, with Jonathan Swift's influence,http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O1-FirstFruits.html the Board of First Fruits was founded.Brown, Stewart Jay (2001). \\"The national churches of England, Ireland, and Scotland, 1801‚Äì1846\\", Oxford University Press, p 65 During the first 70 years of its existence, the board purchased glebe lands for benefices at a total cost of ¬£3,543. It also assisted the building of forty-five glebe houses with gifts of ¬£4,080.Nigel Yates (2006). \\"The religious condition of Ireland, 1770‚Äì1850\\", p 34 In 1778, the Irish Parliament agreed a grant of ¬£6,000, followed by ¬£1,500 in 1779‚Äì1780, ¬£6,000 in 1781‚Äì1782, ¬£3,000 in 1783‚Äì1784 and ¬£5,000 each year from 1785 to 1800. During the period 1791‚Äì1803, the board spent ¬£55,600 towards the building of 88 churches and 116 glebe houses. The grants were maintained after the Act of Union 1800, but the Act of Parliament in 1808 saw a consolidation of the funds and allowed the board to also repair old churches and glebe houses.Brooks, Chris & Saint, Andrew (1995). \\"The Victorian church: architecture and society\\", Manchester University Press, p 133‚Äì134 From 1808, the annual grant doubled to ¬£10,000 and massively increased to ¬£60,000 each year between 1810 and 1816. Thereafter, the grant was halved between 1817 and 1821, finally being reduced to ¬£10,000 each year in 1822‚Äì1823. In the twenty years following the Act of Union, a total of ¬£807,648 was paid out in grants to purchases glebe lands in 193 benefices, the building of 550 glebe houses, and the building, rebuilding and enlargement of 697 churches.D.H.

It was nestled on the western side of the Second Watchung Mountain just to the North of the village of Pluckemin. The major significance of the site lies with the very different picture it yields of military organization during the Revolutionary War, although some point to it as the birthplace of the American military academy, 24 years prior to the founding of the United States Military Academy at West Point. Other terms used to reference the site include the Pluckemin Artillery Park, The Pluckemin Military Academy, and The Pluckemin Artillery Encampment. The Pluckemin Artillery Cantonment site is currently not accessible to the public. There are no buildings, no trails, and it is left as an overgrown wooded area. The only place for visitors to learn about the cantonment site is at the Vanderveer/Knox House & Museum, just to the north and west of the site on Route 202/206 Southbound in Bedminster Township, New Jersey. Overview 1770s drawing of the Pluckemin Cantonment from Captain John Lillie. The large building in the center was known as the Artillery Academy, now noted as America's First Artillery training academy, the forerunner to West Point. The Pluckemin Cantonment was the artillery portion of the second Middlebrook encampment (1778‚Äì79), the seasonal encampment of the Continental Army during the American War for Independence near Middlebrook in Somerset County, New Jersey. The site includes part of the ridge of the First Watchung Mountain. Its position provided a natural fortress not only protecting the Continental Army, but also overlooking the plains towards New Brunswick where the British forces were stationed in 1777. The strategic strength of the position contributed ultimately to the success of the Continental Army. A \\"cantonment\\" is \\"a group of building constructed primarily for the purpose of housing troops\\"; the term camp or \\"encampment\\" refers to troops quartered in their regimental or brigade lines. While some have used the term encampment, the national register recognizes the site as a cantonment. The Jacobus Vanderveer house, just to the north and west of the cantonment site served as headquarters for General Henry Knox during the winter of 1778‚Äì79, when the Continental Army artillery was located in the village of Pluckemin during the Revolutionary War's Second Middlebrook Encampment. The house is the only known building still standing that was associated with the Pluckemin Artillery Cantonment. It is noted that Knox arrived at Pluckemin on December 7, 1778, and departed June 3, 1779, moving towards Pompton with the Continental Army that arrived from Middlebrook. The area was most likely owned on a southern portion of land owned by Jacobus Vanderveer, although Jacob Eoff, a Holland native, was one of the first to settle in the area. Eoff purchased of land around 1743 known then as Bedminstertown or the Pluckemin Crossroads. The next major land owner and resident was Jacobus Vanderveer who on May 10, 1743 purchased just to the north of Eoff's property. Early deeds and wills recognize the cantonment area as belonging to the Vanderveers. The land was later purchased at auction on April 1, 1875 by Tunis Van Arsdale, then to Kate Wickoff (1891), Elizabeth Schley 1902, Hills Development Company, and lastly Bedminster Township. The Pluckemin Academy General Knox enlisted Christopher Colles as preceptor of the academy. As noted in the Regimental Orderly Book 3 on February 23, 1779, \\"General Knox states \\"The Academy is to be opened on Monday next when Mr. Colles the preceptor will attend every day in the wee Sundy excepted for the purpose of teaching the Mathematicks & cc. ... As the Officers of the Corps will be those means have an opportunity of acquiring a more particular and expansive knowledge of the profession and making themselves better qualified to discharge the duties of their respective stations - The General expect that they will apply themselves in good earnest to the study of this so essential & necessary Branch of Science - The duty they owe themselves - a regard for their own reputation and the just expectations of their Country: The General hopes will induce every Officer to pay the closest & most diligent attention.\\" Other operations at Pluckemin * Military Store Department * Laboratory - to repair and produce ammunition * Magazine - Ammunition/powder storage * Hospital (winter of 1779-1780) The First Pluckemin Dig Henry (Max) Schrabisch, the former New Jersey State Archeologist began his archeological efforts on the Pluckemin countryside when the term \\"The Dig\\" originated. Other phrases that were used to identify specific archeological projects at the Pluckemin Cantonment Site include the Pluckemin Dig, the Pluckemin Archeological Dig, and the Pluckemin Archeological Project. The Dig took place over eleven weeks in 1916. The excavations appear to have been completed in 1917, but no field notes or records have been found. Only a series of articles in the local Bernardsville News and a Somerset Quarterly article described the work. The Pluckemin Archeological Project Beginning in 1979, a not for profit research group was formed, combining the efforts of Bedminster Township, the Hills Development Corporation, and academics financially supported by local businesses, individuals, and small foundations. The project was incorporated in 1980 by three principals: John L. Seidel, then a graduate student at the University of Pennsylvania; Clifford Sekel, an historian and area resident who wrote a Masters thesis on the history of the site; and Anne O'Brien, a local historian and Bedminster Township Committeewoman. The Project was supported by contributions from the Hills Development Corporation and local foundations and donors. Seidel conducted the first systematic survey of the site in 1979 and prepared a detailed map of surface features. Excavations at the site began in earnest in 1981 and continued through 1989. The excavation techniques were unusual in uncovering wide areas, preceded by careful plotting and collection of surface finds. A number of advanced techniques were employed, including the use of overhead photomosaics and a variety of remote sensing techniques. The results were reported on annually, in a 1987 PhD dissertation written by Seidel, and in subsequent articles. In 1984 the New Jersey Historical Commission presented the Pluckemin Archaeological Project an award of recognition for helping to preserve New Jersey history and increasing public awareness of and appreciation for that history. The decade of excavation produced one of the largest and best recorded collections of Revolutionary War artifacts in the country. The picture that emerged from the work was that of an army that had found itself after the terrible experience of Valley Forge, building sophisticated barracks and workshops, and as the Pluckemin cantonment became the hub of a remarkably successful re-supply effort. Some portions of the site were subsequently built on by the Hills, although these were primarily areas that had been plowed and then archaeologically investigated. The bulk of the site is owned and preserved by Bedminster Township and patrolled to prevent vandalism and looting. Since the completion of excavations in 1989, work on the artifact assemblage has continued. Under Seidel's direction, a team at Washington College collaborated with experts from Colonial Williamsburg and other sites to produce two generations of a \\"virtual cantonment\\" under contract to the Friends of the Jacobus Vanderveer House. The digital reconstruction is based on the extensive archaeological and historical evidence, as well as advice from architectural historians and other specialists. An animation can be viewed at the nearby Vanderveer House and can be found on YouTube, along with additional materials. Work continues on the assemblage, including experimental archaeology to better understand life during the period.

She is also a character in Serb epic poetry. Biography She was born in 1795, in the village Sikole near Negotin, Serbia to a family of Herzegovinian migrants. She had two sisters, Stojna and Stamena and later, a much younger brother Mihailo. Before the brother grew up, being three sisters, they all wore men's clothes out of the house, because they had no adult brother to protect them. She got her nickname \\"ƒåuƒçuk\\" (from Turkish k√º√ß√ºk = small) due to her short stature. She finished school in Bela Crkva. She met Hajduk Veljko in 1812.Sa Hajduk Veljkom se upoznala u kuƒái negotinskog prote 1812. godine. Pri≈°la mu je i drsko zapitala: ‚ÄûZar tvoji momci ne znaju Turke ubijati, nego devojaƒçke darove krasti?‚Äú Veljko je zastao zbunjen, jer sa njim nijedna ≈æena tako nije razgovarala. Brzo su mu odmah objasnili da su njegovi momci poharali nekoliko sela i gre≈°kom odneli i devojaƒçku spremu one koja je stajala pred njim. Zatim ju je Veljko darovao darovima i zaprosio reƒçima ‚ÄûSada sam te ja darovao, sada si moja!‚Äú (Vuk Karad≈æiƒá: Life of Hajduk Veljko) The two of them lived together even though he still had another, married wife, as divorce was virtually impossible to obtain at the time in an Orthodox country in serious upheaval, that Serbia was during the Serbian Revolution. Veljko was killed in 1813 and she went to live in Panƒçevo. She later married captain and hero of Greek War of Independence Giorgakis Olympios, with whom she moved to Wallachia and later Bucharest. They had three children: Milan, Aleksandar, and Jevrosima. When Giorgakis was also killed during the Battle of Secu monastery in Moldavia on 23 September 1821 at the beginning of Greek Revolution and for the sake of their children's security, she moved with them to Khotyn, Russia, where other people of the Serbian Revolution took refuge. After the liberation of Greece Stana with children moved to Athens, where she got a small state pension as the widow of the hero Olympios.[ŒîŒ∑ŒºŒÆœÑœÅŒ∑œÇ Œ¶œâœÑŒπŒ¨Œ¥Œ∑œÇ,ŒïœÄŒ±ŒΩŒ¨œÉœÑŒ±œÉŒ∑ œÑŒøœÖ 21 , œÑ.Œë,œÉ.445] She died in 1849 or 1850.

Addu Kandu and Mulah Kandu are geographically one channel. But because Fuvahmulah lies north-east of Addu Atoll, the part of the channel in between Fuvahmulah and Addu Atoll is considered as Mulah Kandu by Geographers. The part of the channel in between Huvadhu Atoll and Addu Atoll with no barrier in between is considered as Addu Kandu. Both the channel divisions together are known as the Equatorial Channel because the Equator lies between Huvadhu Atoll and Fuvahmulah. Mulah Kandu is one of the deepest and roughest channel in the Maldives. The island of Fuvahmulah lies in this channel and the channel continues to the eastern tip of Addu Atoll Meedhoo Koagannu Faru. Fuvahmulah in the Mulah Kandu is the first atoll of Maldives in the Southern Hemisphere and the nearest atoll to the Equator. Being so close to the Equator makes Mulah Kandu among the roughest channels in Maldives due to the high pressure winds evolving in the Equator. As a result, Fuvahmulah was often inaccessible to seafarers and travelers in the past. Until Nov 2011, people travelling to Fuvahmulah or from Fuvahmulah to Male' have to be very much dependent on the airport situated in Addu Atoll from where they had to take a ferry to cross the channel, having to undergo the huge challenge of crossing the roughest sea in the country. In 2011 the government of Maldives awarded the bid to develop an airport in the island of Fuvahmulah to the State Trading Organisation. The development of a domestic airport in the island of Fuvahmulah was a dream come true for the residents of Fuvahmulah. Commercial flights were commenced to Fuvahmulah on 11th Nov 2011, and today the national airline of Maldivian, 'Maldivian' flies daily to Fuvahmulah.  Etymology of the name Mulah Kandu  The name Mulah was derived from Mulah the original name of Fuvahmulah. Kandu in Dhivehi means channel. The meaning of the name must be Mulah Channel by then.  Mulah Kandu and Fuvahmulah  Over the years there have been no progress ever in the number of visitors to Fuvahmulah due to the isolation of the island as of now with the absence of an airport. Judging from the neutral point of view it can be said that to avoid the present state of isolation and open the island to the whole world the construction of an airport is a must. Crossing the Mulah Kandu takes at least an hour even during the calmest days of the ocean. Surveys conducted on Maldives Customs Service shows that on average 40 people a day travel between Male' and Fuvahmulah and that they spend about MRF. 5 Million every year to travel to Male' through Addu Atoll including the money paid for the launch, taxis, etc... The construction of an airport in Fuvahmulah means a lot of money will be saved and the economical income of the island by then would be a lot greater than now. Note: \\"Mulah Kandu\\" being referred to as a channel between Meemu Atoll Mulah and Veyvah is a generalized misconception which might be caused by carelessly researched tourist publications or other kind of mislead, wrong information. The correct name of the channel between Mulah and Veyvah is Kuda Kanduolhi, the name given by native Maldivians. The origin of the word \\"Mulah Kandu\\" might have simply been due to the unawareness among Tourists as well as Maldivians concerning Maldivian Geography. Thinking that there is no name allocated for the channel being unaware, the channel would have been named by the later generations as \\"Mulah Kandu\\" originating the name from the name of the island close-by named as Mulah. But the misconceptions have to be cleared and the right names should be used. The right Mulah Kandu is the channel between Fuvahmulah and Addu Atoll. The channels like Kuda Kanduolhi are the smaller channels which are in the Atolls' lagoons. There are thousands of smaller channels like this in Maldives due to the presence of so many islands in an Atoll. They should not be confused with the main Channels of the Maldives. Aware of the extent of problems of this kind which may arise, Maldivian expert Mr. Ibrahim Luthfee wrote a book on Maldivian geography before he died. With this book, which is unfortunately available only in Divehi, the late Mr. Luthfee tried to clear a number of misconceptions like this that carelessly researched tourist publications have generalized even among Maldivians. Much of this article has been translated and adapted from his posthumous work. References * Divehiraajjege J≈çgrafƒ´ge Vanavaru. Muhammadu Ibrahim Lutfee. G.S≈çsanƒ´.

Work began on its construction in July 1963 and the factory was in most respects completed by December 1964. History Initially it was constructed for the assembly of the Renault 16 which was formally launched in March 1965 at the Geneva Motor Show, but not available for sale, even in its home market, till June 1965. Initially the plant, which enjoyed excellent communication links, notably by rail and river, focused on final assembly, while most of the sub-assemblies and other components arrived from older Renault plants located along the River Seine between Le Havre and Paris. For the early Renault 16s running gear and suspension sub-assemblies came from the company's old Billaincourt factory. Also on the banks of the Seine is Cl√©on from where another Renault plant supplied Sandouville with power trains. Flins supplied Sandouville with stampings and chromed components. Subsequent models built at Sandouville include the Renault 17, Renault 20, Renault 30, Renault 18, Renault 21, Renault 25, Renault Safrane, Renault Laguna and Renault Vel Satis, meaning that of the three major Renault plants in France, this is the one that concentrates on the larger models. Since 2003, when the Renault Espace switched from a composite body shell (manufactured on Renault's behalf by Matra) to a more conventional pressed steel body shell, the Espace has also been manufactured at Sandouville. At its peak, the plant employed 12,000 people, but by 2006 this had fallen to just 4,650. Since the Second World War Renault traditionally concentrated on smaller cars, and many of the company's middle-weight and larger models have encountered difficulty establishing significant market share against competitor offerings. Employees looked to the Renault Laguna III, launched at the end of 2007, for an upturn in their prospects. Le Monde on 30 September 2006 reported Renault as saying that if the Laguna III, intended to revive Sandouville's fortunes, failed to take off in the market place, there would be [adverse] consequences for a site currently operating at only 40% of its design capacity. (¬´ Si la premi√®re voiture que l'on essaie de faire revivre √† Sandouville ne marche pas, cela aura des cons√©quences pour ce site qui ne tourne d√©j√† qu'√† 40 % de ses capacit√©s. Notre plan est r√©aliste, mais pas id√©aliste. ¬ª Le Monde, 30 septembre 2006) The new Laguna was not an instant hit with customers, and in July 2008 Renault announced that one of the two work teams would be cancelled, which would involve about 1,000 of the workforce. News report 24 July 2008 On 12 June 2014 Renault announced it would move the production of the third- generation Trafic and the high-roof version of the Opel/Vauxhall Vivaro from Luton to Sandouville. the Sandouville plant is producing the following models: * Renault Trafic III Sources Category:Buildings and structures in Seine- Maritime Category:French companies established in 1964 Category:Renault Category:Motor vehicle assembly plants in France ","title":"Sandouville Renault Factory"},{"id":"26499856","text":"Bernard Peyrilhe (1735‚Äì1804) was a French surgeon, known as one of the founders of experimental cancer research. Peyrilhe was born in Pompignan, and became a lecturer at the Paris School of Surgery ('). In 1773, Peyrilhe was studying for a PhD, when he wrote the first systematic review of cancer in a prize-winning essay which he submitted to the Academy of Letters and Fine Arts in Lyon in response to an essay competition entitled What is Cancer?. His essay covered the nature of the disease, its growth, treatment, and how a \\"virus\\" produced by the tumor caused wasting (cachexia). At the time, the term \\"virus\\" meant any substance which came from an animal's body and which could transmit a disease. Peyrilhe attempted to demonstrate this virus, by injecting an emulsion of fluid from a human breast cancer into a wound he had created on the back of a dog. He kept the dog at his home to observe it, but the dog developed an abscess at the injection site and howled so much that Peyrilhe's servants drowned it. As is now understood, the transfer of cancerous tissue between species is generally unsuccessful, as the recipient's immune system recognizes cells from a different species as foreign, and destroys them (a graft-versus-host interaction). Also in 1773, Peyrihle was the first surgeon to treat breast cancer by radical mastectomy which included both the pectoral muscle and axillary lymph nodes. He considered that the risks of amputating the pectoral muscle were outweighed by the otherwise certain outcome of death. Peyrilhe also successfully treated ulceration with carbolic acid, which was, at the time, a recently discovered acid.

He became notable by his contributions to the philosophy of body culture and by his political radical writings on folk and nation. Henning Eichberg is the father of the composer S√∏ren Nils Eichberg.  History of behaviour and philosophy of body culture  Eichberg received his academic degrees in the field of history in Bochum and in sociology in Stuttgart. At the University of Stuttgart, he was a scholar and companion of August Nitschke :de:August Nitschke in developing the Historical Behaviour Studies (Historische Verhaltensforschung). In 1982, he became professor at the University of Odense, later at the University of Copenhagen, developing the Danish school of body culture studies. During the 1970s, Eichberg studied sport and popular culture in Indonesia and during the 1980s in Libya, paving the way for international comparative studies of body culture. He established the term of \\"body culture\\" in international anthropology and history. His methodological main contributions to this field were the configurational analysis (Konfigurationsanalyse) of movement cultures and the research in their inner contradictions, the so-called trialectics of body culture. He also initiated the so-called Eichberg-Mandell-Guttmann theory of the specific modernity of sport, understanding sport as a pattern of industrial productivity: \\"There were games and athletics in ancient Greece, but no sport.\\" Eichberg contributed to the critical study of Olympism as a neo-colonial (‚Üíneo-colonialism) enterprise and promoted the study of popular games as alternative. Sociologists have placed Eichberg's \\"materialistic phenomenology\\" at the intersection of Norbert Elias, Michel Foucault, and the Frankfurt School of Critical Theory. In 1987, Eichberg co-founded the Institut International d'Anthropologie Corporelle (Rennes/France), in 2002 the Centre for the Study of Body Culture (Tsukuba/Japan), and in 2005 the International Network for the Marxist Study of Sport. Eichberg's contributions to \\"bodily democracy\\" got impact on the international study and politics of Sport for all. His body-cultural writings were translated and especially influential in Finland and East Asia. Besides the philosophy of sport and body culture, others of Eichberg's topics have also received international attention. * History of military technology: Eichberg analyzed the fortification of the Early Modern bastionary type as a configurational expression of social geometry, characterizing the nascent territorial state. * History of laughter: The cultural change of laughter and smile in industrial modernity followed the change of configurations from popular carnival to the seriousness of sportive strain under the premises of productive achievement. * Labyrinth: Eichberg described the history of the labyrinth as a configurational change of folk running, play and game, contrasting the straight lines of modern sport facilities. * Folk mythology: Eichberg wrote the history of the Silesian mountain spirit R√ºbezahl, changing gestalt from shamanic spirit in early popular culture to modern social gift-bringer and revolutionary figure.  Radical writing on folk and nationalism  In Germany, Eichberg became known by his radical writings about nationalism and the philosophy of \\"the people\\" (German Volk, Nordic folk). In his youth, Eichberg engaged on the radical right wing, contributing from 1961 currently to the neo-fascist monthly Nation Europa. Around 1970, he acted as founder and leading intellectual of the \\"New Right\\" and later on as a speaker of the \\"National revolutionary movement\\" in Germany. Regarding the \\"German question\\" (Deutsche Frage:de:Deutsche Frage) as open and potentially revolutionary, these circles opposed the dominating two- Germanies policy and propagated a \\"third way\\" (‚ÜíThird Way (centrism), ‚ÜíThird Position) between East and West. Renouncing from the conservative and anti- democratic \\"Old Right\\", Eichberg and the National Revolutionaries referred to anti-Nazi intellectuals of the Weimar Republic like Ernst Niekisch, Karl Otto Paetel :de:Karl Otto Paetel and A. Paul Weber :de:A. Paul Weber as well as to the anti-Hitler resistance of 20 July 1944. During the 1970s, Eichberg dissociated himself from his earlier right-wing positions. He expressed self- critique against the \\"Eurofascism\\" of his youth and turned towards Third World studies and anti-colonial solidarity. Eichberg launched the concepts of \\"liberation nationalism\\" (‚ÜíTypes of nationalism) and \\"ethno-pluralism\\", opposing Western and European eurocentrism. Entering into discussions with the New Left, he commented: \\"National is revolutionary\\" and \\"Who does not want to talk about the peoples, should silence about the human being\\". Eichberg's contributions about national identity and the \\"Balkanization of everyone\\" were now published by periodicals from socialist, anti-authoritarian, and anarchist milieus.  Towards ecology and socialism  During the mid-1970s, Eichberg turned to ecological criticism and engaged in the nascent Green movement, among others by critical studies on the \\"automobile society\\" and on the \\"container architecture\\" of sports. This became influential for the critical study of social alienation in sport architecture. Eichberg contributed between 1980 and 2002 to the journal Wir Selbst :de:Wir selbst, which tried to build bridge between right-wing national revolutionaries, New Left intellectuals and ecologists. Together with the peace researcher Alfred Mechtersheimer who was at that time member of the German Parliament for the Green party, he founded the peace committee Friedenskomitee 2000, launching the concept of \\"national pacifism\\". After his emigration to Denmark in 1982, Eichberg engaged in Danish socialist milieus, held philosophical courses in socialist summer camps and contributed to left-wing periodicals. Eichberg was appointed as member of the cultural commission of the Socialist People's Party (Denmark) (SF) and published program texts on socialist culture and sport. By studies on the socialist term of \\"folk\\" and \\"the people\\", he extended the study of popular culture towards a theory of \\"the people of democracy\\". Eichberg was especially active in the milieu of Danish People's Academies (folke-h√∏jskoler), which relate themselves to the democratic revival of 1848 and the romantic populism (‚Üíromantic nationalism) of the poet N. F. S. Grundtvig. He was commentator in H√∏jskolebladet and gave courses for foreign Folk Academy students. This influenced his \\"theory of the people\\", based on Grundtvig, Johann Gottfried Herder and Martin Buber. At the 60th anniversary of Eichberg, a Danish festschrift was published collecting critical contributions about \\"folk\\" and the \\"people\\".  Critique and controversies  In the field of body culture studies, Eichberg's theory of the specific modernity of sport as a pattern of productivity was met by critique from the mainstream of sport history. German sociologists of the established \\"sport development aid\\" (Sporthilfe:de:Stiftung Deutsche Sporthilfe) also opposed his critique of \\"sport export\\" and his studies in popular games, the promotion of traditional games being described as Third World romanticism. In Germany, Eichberg became politically controversial because of his involvement in the \\"New Right\\" of the early 1970s. Some authors doubted his change from the right wing to left-wing positions. They pointed to the reception of the term \\"ethnopluralism\\" in milieus of the extreme Right. Eichberg was also distrusted for his meetings with Muammar al-Gaddafi. Eichberg was said to act as \\"godfather\\" for a certain anti-American and anti-capitalist left wing - German Social Democrats (SPD), Socialists and Greens -, who followed a hidden right-wing, nationalist agenda. This interpretation met, however, sharp critique from the side of left-wing anti-fascists. Critics from the right wing accused Eichberg of overstating the structural contradictions between the state and the people. By giving priority to the \\"folk\\", the authority of the state (‚Üístate (polity), ‚Üínation state) would be damaged. In Denmark, leaders of the Olympic sport organisation opposed the sports critique raised by Eichberg and of the Institute of Sport Research, where he was working, as \\"leftism\\" and \\"cultural radicalism\\". The Conservative minister of culture, Brian Mikkelsen, deprived the institute in 2003 of public funding, which it had received during 25 years, and entered into a sharp debate with Eichberg in the media.  Bibliography  Eichberg published about 50 books, most of them about the history and cultural sociology of body culture (physical culture) and sport. Others treat the history of early modern military technology (‚Üífortification), Indonesian studies, and studies in democracy, ethnic minorities and national identity (‚Üícultural identity).

Education  Heylin attended Manchester Grammar School. He read history at Bedford College, University of London, followed by an MA in history at the University of Sussex.  Work  Heylin has written extensively on the life and work of Bob Dylan, combining interviews with discographical research. His full-length biography Dylan: Behind the Shades (1991) was republished in a revised second edition as Bob Dylan: Behind the Shades ‚Äì Take Two (UK edition, 2000) and Bob Dylan: Behind the Shades Revisited (US edition, 2001). Heylin published a detailed analysis of every song by Dylan in two volumes: Revolution in the Air: The Songs of Bob Dylan: Vol. 1: 1957‚Äì73 (2009) and Still on the Road: The Songs of Bob Dylan: Vol. 2: 1974‚Äì2008 (2010). These books analyse 610 songs written by Dylan, devoting a numbered section to each song. In 2011, to mark Dylan's 70th birthday, Heylin published Behind the Shades: The 20th Anniversary Edition, which contained 60,000 words of new material to cover Dylan's work since 2000. He has also written biographies on Van Morrison and Sandy Denny. He received favourable reviews for his studies of Orson Welles, Despite the System: Orson Welles versus the Hollywood Studios, and of Shakespeare's sonnets, So Long As Men Can Breathe. In 2012, Heylin published a book about the theme of mental illness in British rock music in the 1960s and 1970s. Titled All the Madmen, it includes chapters on the Dialectics of Liberation conference of 1967, Syd Barrett, Pink Floyd's album The Dark Side of the Moon, David Bowie's theme of schizophrenia in his songs, the Who's Quadrophenia album, and Nick Drake. Also in 2012, Heylin published E Street Shuffle: The Glory Days of Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band, a biography of Bruce Springsteen and an analysis of his achievements in the recording studio. In 2015, Heylin published It's One for the Money, a history of song publishing since the birth of the popular music industry and the establishment of song copyrights at the beginning of the twentieth century. In 2016, Heylin published his history of UK punk music in the year 1976, Anarchy in the Year Zero: The Sex Pistols, the Clash and the Class of '76. In October 2016, Heylin published his study of Bob Dylan's 1966 World Tour, Judas!: From Forest Hills to the Free Trade Hall: A Historical View of Dylan's Big Boo. Heylin has also contributed the liner notes for the 36-CD set, Bob Dylan: The 1966 Live Recordings, released by Sony/Legacy Recordings, which includes every known recording of Dylan‚Äôs 1966 concert tour. In 2017, Heylin published his account of Dylan's controversial \\"Born Again\\" Christian phase, Trouble In Mind: Bob Dylan's Gospel Years: What Really Happened.

It was demolished in 2010 The historical Muromtsev Dacha was a three-story wooden building with ‚ÄúSwedish-style‚Äù turrets. Because of the damage it suffered in the German-Soviet War, it was dismantled, and a new wooden building was erected on its foundations.  Building history  Modern Muromtsev Dacha (1965 - 2010) The Muromtsev Dacha in Moscow‚Äôs Tsaritsyno District was built in 1893 by Sergey Muromtsev. After Muromtsev's death, his wife Marya Nikolaevna Klementova sold it in 1914 to a merchant‚Äôs widow, Raisa Ivanovna Vlasova. In 1918 a large number of the Tsaritsyno dachas were nationalized. The former summer cottages of S. A. Muromtsev and N. P. Bakhrushin were transformed into an elementary and a high school called ‚ÄúVlasovka‚Äù and ‚ÄúBakhrushinka‚Äù after the names of their former owners.http://school510.narod.ru/schoolstory/indexstory.htm In 1937 a new brick building was erected, and the old ones were transformed into flats for the teachers. During the German-Soviet War the area was heavily bombed by the German air force because of the proximity of the largest urban grain elevator. During one of the bomb raids in 1941 a high-explosive bomb fell into the pond near the house. One of the walls was damaged and a corner of the house fell in. The slit was stopped up with blankets. Teachers continued to live in the house until 1964. In the early 1960s the house was largely dismantled and it was rebuilt into a two-storey long-corridor wooden house on a total area of 616 sq.m. The foundations of the old dacha were preserved as well as its furnace, located on the same ground on the floor plans of the old and the new building. In the autumn of 1964 the former inhabitants could move in again. In 1979 the house was declared uninhabitable because of dilapidation and handed over to the Institute of Clinical and Experimental Medicine () ‚Äúto accommodate special equipment‚Äù for a period of five years, after which the demolition of the building and improvement of the area was foreseen by the Soviet Academy of Medical Sciences. However, the lease was continuously renewed until 1989. The house was not demolished then, but the Krasnogvardeysky District executive committee passed it unconditionally to the accounting of the Mercury Commercial Center. In April 1991 this latter gave written authorization to six citizens and their families to live in the house provided they attended to the maintenance of the house and its grounds at their own expense. On 3 June 1991, ‚ÄúMercury‚Äù wrote the house off their accounting. The house no. 3 on Fifth Radial Street () formally ceased to exist. At the end of 2005, in terms of the declaration issued on 24 October 2005 by the Moscow Land Registry, nobody claimed the rights to the plot where the house stood. In 2006 the inhabitants went to court with the demand to recognize their right of ownership to the house on the basis of Ch. 14, Art. 234, by title of acquisitive prescription. In court, the Moscow City Property Department refused to be a defendant as ‚Äúthe house did not figure in the accounting of the Department‚Äù, as did the Department of Housing Policy and Housing Funds because ‚Äúthe house was not officially considered inhabited‚Äù. On 28 August 2007, the administration of Moscow, without waiting for the completion of the proceedings of the recognition of property rights for the residents of the house, handed over the house in the management of the Tsaritsyno State Museum-Reserve. On 10 October 2007 the Prefecture declared the plot, together with the house, a ‚Äúparking lot for cleaning and electric equipment‚Äù.; on 25 October the right to the property of the house was not owned by anyone, as evidenced by an extract from the Land Registry. On 3 January 2010, the house was almost completely destroyed by fire, the cause of which was considered arson by the building‚Äôs residents (see below).http://lenta.ru/news/2010/01/03/fire/http://lenta.ru/news/2010/01/12/datcha/  Cultural importance  The historic owner of the dacha was the Russian lawyer, publicist and politician Sergey Muromtsev, Professor of Moscow University, Chairman of the First Imperial Duma in 1906, co-author of the first Constitution of Russia. The dacha was built at the expense of Muromtsev‚Äôs wife Marya Nikolaevna Klimentova, the famous opera singer who at the personal insistence Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky sang the role of Tatiana for ten years in the opera Eugene Onegin in the Bolshoi Theatre. The house was often visited by later Nobel laureate Ivan Bunin, who met here his future wife Vera Nikolaevna Muromtseva, niece of the owner of the house. From 1906 they lived together, and although Bunin preferred to travel in abroad, in the summer they often came home to Russia and lived in the spacious dacha of Sergey Muromtsev in Tsaritsyno. In recent decades a museum was established in the dacha, dedicated to the memory of the several outstanding people who various times visited Tsaritsino or lived here during the past century. A number of celebrities lived and worked in the dacha or were guests of it: the writer Venedict Yerofeyev, director Boris Yukhananov, painter Konstantin Vasilyev, sculptor Vyacheslav Klykov, director Ivan Maximov. The museum housed the meetings of the veterans of Tsaritsyno, arranged puppet shows for children, student seminars, evenings for the association of families with many children, public readings of contemporary literature, and collective screenings of contemporary Russian animated films organized by ‚ÄúNike‚Äù laureate director Ivan Maximov.  Application for the recognition of the area as a cultural heritage site  On 15 May 2009 the representatives of the Social Movement ‚ÄúArkhnadzor‚Äù Y. V. Mezentseva and K. P. Mikhailov in the legally required way presented an application for the recognition of ‚Äúthe dachas of old Tsaritsyno, linked between 1900 and 1970 to the name prominent national historical and cultural figures S. A. Muromtsev, I. A. Bunin, Venedict Yerofeyev, K. Vasilyev and others, at Fifth Radial Street 3, the former dacha of S. A. Muromtsev, and Fifth Radial Street 7, the gate of the former Yerokhov Dacha‚Äù as objects of cultural heritage. This application and the enclosed historical materials, evidencing of the historical and cultural, natural and architectural value of the above-mentioned objects, were registered under the provisional number 16-02-519/9-(1). In accordance with the Regulation of the City Registry of immovable cultural heritage, as approved by the Government of Moscow on 18 July 2006 under no. 510-PP, the plot and dacha of S. A. Muromtsev and the gate of the Erokhov Dacha as ‚Äúsubmitted objects‚Äù were registered both in the Registry and in the open electronic submission list on the Internet under the name ‚ÄúDacha of S. A. Muromtsev where I. A. Bunin lived and worked for 20 years‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe gate building of the Erokhov Dacha, late 19th-early 20th century‚Äù. The application has not been judged yet.  Demolition and controversy  On 7 March 2010 the house was demolished without the executives‚Äô presenting any other legal document than a ‚Äúpermission to remove building debris‚Äù.–î–∞—á–∞ –ú—É—Ä–æ–º—Ü–µ–≤–∞ —Å–Ω–µ—Å–µ–Ω–∞. // Lenta.ru, 7 –º–∞—Ä—Ç–∞ 2010 The inhabitants of the house have asserted that the demolition was illegal, while the authorities labeled it ‚Äúremoval of fire debris‚Äù.–î–∞—á—É –ú—É—Ä–æ–º—Ü–µ–≤–∞ –ø—É—Å—Ç–∏–ª–∏ –ø–æ–¥ –∫–æ–≤—à. // –†–ò–ê –ù–æ–≤–æ—Å—Ç–∏, 7 –º–∞—Ä—Ç–∞ 2010–î–∞—á—É –ú—É—Ä–æ–º—Ü–µ–≤–∞ —Å–Ω–µ—Å–ª–∏ –ø–æ–¥ –≤–∏–¥–æ–º —É–±–æ—Ä–∫–∏ –º—É—Å–æ—Ä–∞ (–≤–∏–¥–µ–æ). // –†–ò–ê –ù–æ–≤–æ—Å—Ç–∏, 7 –º–∞—Ä—Ç–∞ 2010 The newscast Vesti-Moscow of Russia 1 TV Channel reported that among the persons sent to demolish the house there was no bailiff, and that the inhabitants were not shown any writ of execution or order of demolition. ‚ÄúPeople were thrusted out of the house without any explication. Bulldozers started to break down the walls, although there were people in the building. Those fleeing to the second floor and on the roof were extremely roughly taken away by riot police wearing masks.‚Äù A few people, including 20 years old inhabitant Anfisa Boldyreva were taken to hospital after the forced eviction with injuries on the head and elsewhere.¬´–ë—É–ª—å–¥–æ–∑–µ—Ä–Ω–æ–µ –ø—Ä–∞–≤–æ¬ª –ø–æ-–º–æ—Å–∫–æ–≤—Å–∫–∏. // –í–µ—Å—Ç–∏-–ú–æ—Å–∫–≤–∞, 9 –º–∞—Ä—Ç–∞ 2010 The Prefecture declared to the court that the ownership of the house belonged to them. Their evidence, an extract from the Moscow Land Registry, had no issue or receipt number whatsoever. However, before the beginning of the proceeding ‚Äì and even as late as 10 September 2008 ‚Äì it was not on file in the Unified State Registry. Even before the end of the proceeding for the inhabitants‚Äô rights of property to the house, the Prefecture disposed of the territory and of the house as an owner, without being officially authorized to this by any document. They attempted to intimidate the residents by constant and brutal police raids. In September 2008 the Unified State Registry repeatedly confirmed that the house was not in the registry, although in the meantime certain state organs have presented claims for this object. According to verbal information, this organ was the City of Moscow. As of 10 March 2010, the proceeding for the residents‚Äô property right to the house are still in progress. To substantiate such rights, the continuous possession in good faith of the house for a period of 15 years must be evidenced. The court does not accept the testimony of witnesses as an evidence, on the grounds that they are the friends of the inhabitants. However, this refusal is one-sided, as on the basis of utility bills and on the absence of any alternative housing of the residents there can be no doubt on their continuous use of the house.

He is known for translating the visual language cultivated on the streets into illustrations, paintings and drawings. His works have been exhibited in several locations around Finland, most recently in Pori Art Museum together with such internationally renowned street artists as Blu and Invader.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aezzO4lq7Rk  History  Otto Maja's mural in Pori (2013). At the age of twelve Maja's interest towards drawing was triggered by his babysitter's boyfriend, a graffiti artist. In the years that followed, Maja learned how to master urban canvases, developing a good sense of space which is reflected in his illustrations and drawings. Between 1998 and 2008, Helsinki had a zero tolerance policy in regards to street art, enforced with private security contractors. In this atmosphere many artists, including Maja, needed to develop both stealth and methods to create pieces quickly - stickers, stencils and paste-ups. After years of battling with the authorities, Maja decided to leave Helsinki to study graphic design at a folk high school in Anjalankoski, ending up teaching it for another year at the same institute. After living and working in the countryside of Jurva for some years, Maja returned to Helsinki. Throughout the years, he has held several successful exhibitions all around Finland, for example in Sein√§joki, Helsinki, Pori and Kouvola .http://muotoaetsimassa.blogspot.com/2010/02/nayttely-otto- majan-naamakerroin.html In the field of graphic design, he is known for designing flyers for clubs and other events. In order to promote Finnish street art, Maja set up the Nimi Collectivehttp://nimi.blogspot.com/ in 2010. It continues to regularly exhibit the works of Finnish street artists online. In 2012 Nimi collective grew into an art agency called Omanimi that continues to produce commissioned artworks. In the summer of 2013, Maja painted the biggest mural by a Finnish artist, in Pori, Finland.http://www.hs.fi/kotimaa/Porista+luodaan+pikku- Berliini%C3%A4/a1374721338106  Exhibitions  * 2008 Yst√§v√§st√§, Kouvola's Head library * 2009 Vapaalinja, Mbar, Helsinki * 2009 Lasipalatsi Design Markets, Lasipalatsi, Helsinki * 2010 Naamakerroin, Still Standing, Sein√§joki * 2010 Street n Beat, Stache 1, Sein√§joki * 2011 Wildlife, Lasipalatsi, Helsinki * 2011 Rikoskumppani, Geezers the shop, Helsinki * 2011 For the Name of Mosquitoes, Cafe Talo, Helsinki * 2012 Street Art - The next Generation, Pori Art Museum, Pori * 2012 Behind the Curtain, Make your mark, Helsinki * 2012 Two pens, Gallery Bertta, Kotka * 2012 Street Art - The Next Generation, Kunsthallen Brandts, Odense * 2013 Omanimi Opening - Nimikollektiv, Omanimi, Helsinki * 2013 Charta, Omanimi, Helsinki * 2013 Reunion of Blind People, 931, Tampere * 2013 The Art of Slaughter, group exhibition, Teurastamo, Helsinki * 2013 This is FIECEL!, group exhibition with Emmi Mustonen, Sanomatalo, Helsinki * 2013 Resident Artist, Flow Festival * 2015 Better is ruining the good 1/3, Rupla, Helsinki * 2015 Better is ruining the good 2/3, Mothership Of Work (Artist residency) * 2016 Better is ruining the good 2/3, Galleria Tiuku (exhibition of the year) ReferencesExternal links * Otto Maja's Homepage * Otto Maja's community on Facebook * Nimi Collective Category:1987 births Category:Finnish graffiti artists Category:Living people ","title":"Otto Maja"},{"id":"26500127","text":"Veymandoo Kandu is the channel between Thaa Atoll and Laamu Atoll of the Maldives.

Silk is a fibre produced by the silkworm in production of its cocoon. It consists mainly of two proteins, fibroin and sericin. Silk consists of 70‚Äì80% fibroin and 20‚Äì30% sericin; fibroin being the structural center of the silk, and sericin being the gum coating the fibres and allowing them to stick to each other.  Structure  Sericin is composed of 18 different amino acids, of which 32% is serine. The secondary structure is usually a random coil, but it can also be easily converted into a Œ≤-sheet conformation, via repeated moisture absorption and mechanical stretching. The serine hydrogen bonds give its glue-like quality. The genes encoding sericin proteins have been sequenced. Its C-terminal part contains many serine-rich repeats. Using gamma ray examination, it was determined that sericin fibers are composed typically of three layers, all with fibers running in different patterns of directionality. The innermost layer, typically is composed of longitudinally running fibers, the middle layer is composed of cross fiber directional patterned fibers, and the outer layer consists of fiber directional fibers. The overall structure can also vary based on temperature, whereas the lower the temperature, there were typically more Œ≤-sheet conformations than random amorphous coils. There are also three different types of sericin, which make up the layers found on top of the fibroin. Sericin A, which is insoluble in water, is the outermost layer, and contains approximately 17% nitrogen, along with amino acids such as serine, threonine, aspartic acid, and glycine. Sericin B, composed the middle layer and is nearly the same as sericin A, but also contains tryptophan. Sericin C is the innermost layer, the layer that comes closest to and is adjacent to fibroin. Also insoluble in water, sericin C can be separated from the fibroin via the addition of a hot, weak acid. Sericin C also contains the amino acids present in B, along with the addition of proline.  Applications  Sericin has also been used in medicine and cosmetics. Due to its elasticity and tensile strength, along with a natural affinity for keratin, sericin is primarily used in medicine for wound suturing. It also has a natural infection resistance, and is used variably due to excellent biocompatibility, and thus is used commonly as a wound coagulant as well. When used in cosmetics, sericin has been found to improve skin elasticity and several anti-aging factors, including an anti-wrinkle property. This is done by minimizing water loss from the skin. To determine this, scientists ran several experimental procedures, including a hydroxyproline assay, impedance measurements, water loss from the epidermis and scanning electron microscopy to analyze the rigidity and dryness of the skin. The presence of sericin increases hydroxyproline in the stratum corneum, which in turn, decreases skin impedance, thus increasing skin moisture. Adding in pluronic and carbopol, two other factors that can be included in sericin gels, perform the action of repairing natural moisture factors (NMF), along with minimizing water loss, and in turn, improving skin moisture.

BPAY is a registered trading name of BPAY Pty Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary of Cardlink Services Limited. Cardlink is owned equally by the four major Australian banks: Australia and New Zealand Banking Group, Commonwealth Bank, National Australia Bank and Westpac.About BPAY, Overview . Retrieved January 2015  How it works  Businesses or other organisations in Australia which choose to participate in the BPAY system would register as billers with the BPAY operating company through its bank. A biller must have an ACN or ABN and a banking relationship with an Australian financial institution. The BPAY operating company would allocate a biller number to the business, which would be printed with the BPAY logo on their bills, as well as an indication of what reference number a customer should use when making a payment. To make a payment, a customer would visit his or her Australian financial institution's online, mobile or telephone banking facility, where he or she would enter the biller code, reference number and payment amount as well as an indication of the account to be debited, which may also be a credit card. Some billers do not accept credit cards (or accept payment from a limited list of credit cards) in payment through BPAY. The financial institution may limit the accounts which may be used for BPAY payments, and save the biller references information for use by the customer for future payments. As a security measure, when making a BPAY payment to a new biller, the financial institution will typically send a SMS message with a validation code to the customer‚Äôs mobile phone. The customer would need to enter the validation code before the transaction is processed. This may create difficulties if the customer is making the payment while abroad. The customer does not need to register for the service. The customer would usually not be required to pay a fee for the service, but the biller would usually pay a fee to its bank, and the credit card company if a card was used in payment. After a customer has made a payment using BPAY, the financial institution where the payment was made would send by electronic funds transfer the payment details to the biller's bank (if different) and the biller's bank would credit the biller's designated bank account with the payment amount, and the biller will be advised of the customer reference number and payment amount, for automatic or manual entry into its accounting system. Transactions completed before a cut-off time set by the financial institution will normally be processed and paid on the same day, otherwise it will be processed on the next business day. The remitting bank may charge the biller's bank an interchange fee.  History  The BPAY system was launched on 18 November 1997 as an electronic bill payment system for bill payments by phone. It was the world's first single bill payment service adopted across the banking sector. It soon offered bill payments over the Internet through financial institutions' online banking sites. In 2002 BPAY View was introduced, which delivers bills and statements electronically through Australian financial institution's internet banking sites. As of January 2015, BPAY payments can be made through more than 156 participating Australian banks, credit unions and financial institutions. More than 45,000 businesses accept payments using BPAY and each month approximately 30 million bills to the value of $24 billion are paid using BPAY.

Its surface area is . The Neman River () supplies about 90% of its inflows; its watershed consists of about 100,450 square kilometres in Lithuania and Russia's Kaliningrad Oblast. Human history Landsat photo In the 13th century, the area around the lagoon was part of the ancestral lands of the Curonians and Old Prussians. Later it bordered the historical region of Lithuania Minor. At the northern end of the Spit, there is a passage to the Baltic Sea, and the place was chosen by the Teutonic Knights in 1252 to found Memelburg castle and the city of Memel ‚Äî officially called Klaipƒóda in 1923-39, when the Memel Territory was separated from Germany, and again after 1945, when it became part of the Lithuanian SSR. As the new interwar border, the river that flows into the Curonian Lagoon near Rusnƒó () was chosen. The river's lower 120 km in Germany were called die Memel by Germans, while the upper part located in Lithuania was known as Nemunas River. The border also separated the peninsula near the small holiday resort of Nida, Lithuania (); the southern part of the Spit and the Lagoon remained in Germany until 1945. This border is now the border between Lithuania and Russia, as after World War II, the southern end of the Spit and the German area south of the river ‚Äî the part of East Prussia with the city K√∂nigsberg in Sambia ‚Äî became part an exclave of Russia called Kaliningrad Oblast.

The Kur≈°ininkai were eventually assimilated by the Germans, except along the Curonian Spit where some still live. The Kur≈°ininkai were considered Latvians until after World War I, when Latvia gained independence from the Russian Empire, a consideration based on linguistic arguments.

She was the daughter of actress Ellen Terry and the progressive English architect-designer Edward William Godwin, and the sister of theatre practitioner Edward Gordon Craig. As a lesbian, an active campaigner for women's suffrage, and a woman working as a theatre director and producer, Edith Craig has been recovered by feminist scholars as well as theatre historians.Dymkowski (1992); Cockin (1998), among others; and Gandolfi (2003) Craig lived in a m√©nage √† trois with the dramatist Christabel Marshall and the artist Clare 'Tony' Atwood from 1916 until her death.Holroyd (2008)Rubin, Martin. \\"A Strange Eventful History: The Dramatic Lives of Ellen Terry, Henry Irving, and Their Remarkable Families by Michael Holroyd\\", Los Angeles Times, 23 March 2009, accessed 18 October 2015Rudd, Jill & Val Gough (eds.)Charlotte Perkins Gilmore: Optimist Reformer, University of Iowa Press, p. 90 (1999)Law, Cheryl.

Edith Craig was born the following year at Gusterwoods Common in Hertfordshire, and was given the surname 'Craig' to avoid the stigma of illegitimacy.Booth, Michael R. \\"Terry, Dame Ellen Alice (1847‚Äì1928)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, September 2004; online edn, January 2008, accessed 4 January 2010Profile of Terry by Amanda Hodges The family lived in Fallows Green, Harpenden in Hertfordshire, designed by Godwin, until 1874. The couple separated in 1875. In 1877 Terry married her second husband, Charles Wardell, an actor with the stage name Charles Kelly with whom she had worked. He became a father figure for the children leading to Craig taking the name Wardell. However, in 1907 Terry married her third husband, James Carew, whom Edith Craig did not like. Craig was educated at Mrs Cole's school, a co-educational institution in Earls Court in London, and at the Royal Academy of Music. Craig made her first appearance on the stage in 1878 during the run of Olivia at the Royal Court Theatre. She trained as a pianist under Alexis Hollander in Berlin, Germany, from 1887 to 1890. She also occasionally studied under Elizabeth Malleson of Dixton Manor Hall, Winchcombe, Gloucestershire.Katharine Cockin, \\"Craig, Edith Ailsa Geraldine (1869‚Äì1947)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, Sept 2004; online edn, Jan 2008 accessed 10 March 2010 Theatre career Ellen Terry and Edith Craig onstage at the Lyceum Theatre c.1895 Craig joined the Lyceum Theatre company as a costume designer and actress, touring America in 1895 and 1907 under the stage name Ailsa Craig. She was noted for historically accurate costumes and gained recognition for them. Like her younger brother, Craig appeared with Henry Irving in a number of plays, including The Bells (1895). In 1895 her performances in Pinero's Bygones and Charles Reade's The Lyons Mail respectively were praised by George Bernard Shaw and Eleonora Duse. George Bernard Shaw was a family friend of Craig's, he wrote several roles specifically for her. In Bernard Shaw's play Candida, it is believed that the role of Prossy was created for Craig, who originally played the role. Craig also acted in plays by George Bernard Shaw and Henrik Ibsen, toured with Mrs Brown-Potter and the Independent Theatre. In 1899, Irving employed her to make the costumes for his production of Robespierre, which led to her going into business as a dressmaker as Edith Craig & Co in Covent Garden until 1903. After Ellen Terry left the Lyceum Theatre and went into management, Craig accompanied her on her tours in the English provinces and America as her stage-director, and from then play- production became her chief occupation. Craig founded the Pioneer Players (1911‚Äì1925), a theatre society based in London.Cockin (2001) The Pioneer Players were known for producing formerly banned plays, plays on social humanism, women's suffrage and feminism and, from 1915, foreign plays in English. The plays in translation allowed the group to reach beyond the Actresses Franchise League and to be accepted into mainstream English theatre. Craig's mother, Ellen Terry, was president of the society. Craig served as the managing director / stage director, and her partner, Chris St. John, served as the secretary. An advisory committee included George Bernard Shaw and the President Gabrielle Enthoven.Who's Who in the Theatre, 8th edition 1936, ed. John Parker The Pioneer Players has been described by some critics as a women's theatre company, increasing women's opportunities in theatre.The Orlando Project of Women Writers for whom Craig produced approximately 150 plays. After the Pioneer Players finally closed, Craig produced plays for the Little Theatre movement at York, Leeds, Letchworth and Hampstead. In 1919, she was an important figure in the British Drama League (BDL), which had been formed to promote amateur theatre throughout the United Kingdom, and to encourage a lasting peace after World War I.Cockin, Katharine. \\"Dame Ellen Terry and Edith Craig: Suitable Subjects for Teaching\\" , Wordplay, English Subject Centre Magazine, Issue 2, October 2009, accessed 18 October 2015 Later Craig directed plays at the Everyman Theatre, Hampstead and Leeds Art Theatre.Cockin (1998) In 1929, the year after Ellen Terry's death, Craig converted the Elizabethan barn adjacent to Terry's house at Smallhythe Place into a theatre which she named The Barn Theatre. Here she produced Shakespeare every year to commemorate the anniversary of her mother's death. Craig also appeared in a number of silent films,Craig on the Internet Movie Database including Fires of Fate (1923). Edith Craig in the 1910s Craig was involved in many suffrage groups, and sold newspapers on behalf of that cause in the street. After she met a woman selling newspapers for the Women's Freedom she became a member and worked at branch level for that group. She did not fully understand the meaning of suffragism, but formed strong opinions about it quickly. She stated that she \\"grew up quite firmly certain that no self- respecting woman could be other than a suffragist\\". Craig used her theatrical experience on behalf of the Actresses' Franchise League and was also involved in various suffrage productions. She directed A Pageant of Great Women, a play she devised with the writer and actor Cicely Hamilton, which was performed across the United Kingdom before large audiences. A Pageant followed the concept of a morality play in which the main character, Woman, is confronted by the antagonist, Prejudice, who believes that men and women are not equal. Justice presides over the debate between Prejudice and Woman, as groups of great women process on stage as evidence of women's achievements in art, government, education, spiritual matters and battle.Cockin (2005), pp. 527‚Äì42 Craig directed each production of this play, bringing the three professional actors to perform Woman, Justice and Prejudice and the historically accurate costumes with her to each venue. Craig frequently played the role of Rosa Bonheur, a lesbian artist. Personal life and death The composer Martin Shaw proposed to Craig in 1903, and she accepted. However, the marriage was prevented by Ellen Terry, out of jealousy for her daughter's affection, and by Christabel Marshall, who wrote under the pseudonym Christopher St. John, with whom Craig lived from 1899 until they were joined in 1916 by the artist Clare 'Tony' Atwood, living in a m√©nage √† trois until Craig's death in 1947. Her lesbian lifestyle was looked down upon by her family. Her brother Edward said Edith's sexuality was a result of her \\"hatred of men, initiated by the hatred of her father\\". Craig became involved in several books about her mother and George Bernard Shaw which created a rift in the relationship with her brother, who asked Craig not to write about their mother, and specifically not to share the details of the family's innermost problems. Edward Gordon Craig's book Ellen Terry and her Secret Self (1931) explicitly objected to Ellen Terry and Bernard Shaw: a Correspondence (1931) edited by Christopher St. John. In 1932 Craig co-edited with St. John Ellen Terry's Memoirs in which she replied to her brother's representation of their mother. Also in 1932 Craig adopted Ruby Chelta Craig.Cockin (1998), p. 167 Craig was reconciled with her brother some time before her death. Edith Craig, Clare Atwood and Christabel Marshall at Smallhythe Place On the death of her mother Craig committed her life to preserving her mother's legacy. She opened the family home, Smallhythe Place in Kent, England to the public. From 1939 she was supported in running the house by the National Trust. On her death she left Smallhythe Place to the National Trust as a memorial to her mother.Ellen Terry and Edith Craig Database Craig died of coronary thrombosis and chronic myocarditis on 27 March 1947 at Priest's House, Smallhythe Place while planning a Shakespeare festival in honour of her mother. Her body was cremated. Marshall and Atwood are buried alongside each other at St John the Baptist's Church, Small Hythe. Craig's ashes were supposed to be buried there as well, but at the time of Marshall and Atwood's deaths, the ashes got lost and a memorial was placed in the cemetery instead.Rachlin, Ann. Edy was a Lady. Troubador Publishing (2011), p. 62 Edith Craig suffered from acute arthritis especially in her hands. In her younger days, this painful condition prevented her from becoming a professional musician. She attended the Royal Academy of Music and held a certificate in piano from Trinity College. In her later years, after the death of her mother, Craig dictated her memoirs to her friend Vera Holme, known as Jacko. Holme wrote them down in a quarto notebook that was \\"lost in an attic\\" for decades and then sold to Ann Rachlin in 1978. They included Craig's reminiscences of her childhood and life with her mother, Edward Gordon Craig and Henry Irving. Rachlin published them in her book Edy was a Lady in 2011.Rachlin (2011), passim Virginia Woolf is said to have used Edith Craig as a model for the character of Miss LaTrobe in her novel Between the Acts (1941).

He is the founder and general secretary of the Society for Threatened Peoples (STP).  Life  Z√ºlch was born in Liebau, in the Sudetenland, now Libina, Czech Republic. His family left the Sudetenland in 1945, during the postwar expulsion of Germans. As a boy he belonged to the B√ºndische Jugend, part of the German Youth Movement, in Hamburg. He completed his Abitur at the Louisenlund Gymnasium in Rendsburg-Eckernf√∂rde. He studied politics and economics in Hamburg, Graz, and Heidelberg. He was active in college political groups and the Au√üerparlamentarische Opposition. In June 1968, with Klaus Guerke, he founded Aktion: Biafra Hilfe to draw the attention of the world to the genocide happening in Biafra, in present-day Nigeria. The Society for Threatened Peoples () grew out of this organization in 1970. Its main office has been located in G√∂ttingen since 1979. , its German branch, GfbV- Deutschland, is one of the largest human rights organizations in Germany. Tilman Z√ºlch feels that it is an obligation to campaign for religiously and ethnically persecuted people, especially for Germany and Austria given the crimes of Nazi Germany. He feels that the way for Germans to deal with the past is not to stay silent in face of other crimes such as those of the Stalin era, the mass expulsions of Germans after 1945, or the genocides of today. For example, in the early 1990s he was fined for breaking into a Messerschmitt- B√∂lkow-Blohm warehouse in Munich to secure evidence of the company's covertly supplying the Iraqi air force; he repeatedly protested Russia's military actions in Chechnya, comparing the bombing of Grozny to Dresden in 1945; in 2005 in advance of the official visit of German Chancellor Gerhard Schr√∂der to Kaliningrad (formerly K√∂nigsberg, East Prussia) to celebrate the city's 750th anniversary, he demanded in an open letter that Schr√∂der note the mass expulsions and deaths of Germans there and elsewhere in the former eastern territories of Germany under Stalin; he protested the 2008 Summer Olympics in China on behalf of Tibet, comparing it to the 1936 Olympics in Berlin under the Nazis; and he has been credited as one of those most responsible for the Sinti and Roma being recognized as a minority people in Germany.

Theophanes the Confessor erroneously calls him a brother of the Emperor.. Biography Possibly the son or grandson of a similarly named general active in Scythia Minor in 528, Baduarius is recorded by the Latin epic poet Flavius Cresconius Corippus as having succeeded Justin in his post as curopalates immediately after the latter's rise to the Byzantine throne on November 14, 565. At the time, he was already a holder of the rank of patrikios. In circa 566/567, Baduarius was ordered to raise an army in the lower Danube (Moesia and Scythia Minor) in order to assist the Gepids against the Lombards. The Byzantines won the first battle, but then the Gepid king Cunimund refused to hand back Sirmium as he had promised. Left unaided against the Lombards and Avars, Cunimund was defeated and killed. The post of Baduarius in this campaign is obscure: he may have been a magister militum per Illyricum, a magister militum without an assigned area, or the quaestor exercitus.. A comes stabuli (\\"count of the imperial stables\\") in 573, he was sent to Italy soon after to resist the Lombard conquest of the peninsula. The Lombards, however, defeated him in battle in 576, and he died soon after. Family Baduarius had married Justin's daughter Arabia, with whom he may have had a daughter, Firmina, attested in a single inscription dated to 564.. The phrasing is obscure: it contains a Greek word that could be seen as \\"Œ≥ŒµŒΩŒ∑ŒºŒ≠ŒΩŒ∑\\" or \\"Œ≥ŒµŒΩœåŒºŒµŒΩŒ∑\\" of Arabia. The term \\"Œ≥ŒµŒΩŒ∑ŒºŒ≠ŒΩŒ∑\\" means \\"born of\\" and would make the phrase read \\"Firmina, daughter of Arabia\\", whilst \\"Œ≥ŒµŒΩœåŒºŒµŒΩŒ∑\\" means \\"who became\\".

Early Dr. Maguire was born in 1721 in the parish of Killesher, County Fermanagh, Ireland. His brothers were Bryan, Philip, John and James Maguire. His family was descended from the Maguire chiefs of Fermanagh but were dispossessed of their lands and all they had left was a small farm in Killesher. He studied at Louvain University in Belgium and joined the Franciscan Order of Friars Minor Observants. He was a Guardian of the Order in Rome and Louvain. Bishop of Dromore On the recommendation of Cardinal Franz Christoph von Hutten zu Stolzenfels, Bishop of Speyer, Dr. Maguire was appointed as Bishop of Dromore on 10 February 1767, in succession to Bishop Anthony O'Garvey. Sir James Caldwell of Castle Caldwell, County Fermanagh, acted as his referee. Dr.Maguire seems to have been an unhelpful man when appointed Bishop of Dromore, if we are to believe the testimony of Major Edward Magauran who visited the bishop in the Spring of 1767 (\\"Memoirs of Major M'Gauran\\", Volume I, Page 134, London 1786). The major was born in Ballymagovern, County Cavan on 16 April 1746, the grandson of Colonel Bryan Magauran, the Chief of the Clan McGovern who fought in the Battle of the Boyne for King James II against William III of Orange. At the time of Dr. Maguire's appointment as Bishop of Dromore, Edward M'Gauran was then serving as an ensign in General Loudon's Austrian Regiment of Foot. He needed his pedigree proved by a respectable witness in Ireland and he states as follows; \\"My relations being numerous, and dispersed throughout the kingdom, I was several months employed in collecting their attestations , which I found was necessary to have corroborated by the testimony of Dr. Reilly, the Titular Bishop of Kilmore, who was then absent: I applied to Dr. M‚ÄôGuire, the Catholic Bishop of Dromore, then at the house of Mr. Robert M‚ÄôGuire of Tempo; He refused to grant me my request, although he knew my pretensions to be just. Exasperated by his duplicity, which was injurious to my purpose and his tenets, I set off, and travelling all night, arrived the next morning at Kilmore, the seat of Dr. Craddock, the Protestant Bishop, who signed my certificate, which was followed by the dignified clergy, and the nobility of the neighbourhood, which I thought an ample indemnification for my recent disappointment\\". (Major M'Gauran's identification of Dr. Reilly as Titular Bishop of Kilmore is puzzling as Andrew Campbell was bishop at the time. However Campbell was in hiding and living out of the diocese at Dunany, County Louth so it may refer to Rev. Dr. John O'Reilly, parish priest of Crosserlough, County Cavan who was Vicar General of Kilmore at the time. Dr. John Cradock was Protestant Bishop of Kilmore from 11 November 1757 until March 1772. The Maguires of Tempo at whose house the bishop stayed were a Protestant branch of the family. However they remained close to their Catholic cousins as in evidenced by the bishop residing with them and also by the fact that when he was bishop of Kilmore in 1793, Dr. Maguire supported the Protestant Captain Hugh Maguire of Tempo when he attempted to appoint the Catholic clergy of Enniskillen and Tempo in opposition to Bishop Hugh O'Reilly of Clogher. Bishop Maguire's agent in Rome, Fr. James Cowan OFM, Guardian of St.Isidore's College, prepared an appeal in Italian to the Papacy on Hugh Maguire's behalf.). Bishop of Kilmore On the death of Bishop Andrew Campbell of Kilmore Diocese on 1 December 1769, Dr. Maguire was translated to Kilmore as bishop by Propaganda on 20 March 1770 and was approved by the Pope on 25 March 1770. His belonging to the Franciscans caused trouble as he was accused of appointing fellow Franciscans to the best parishes in the Diocese. Laurence Taaffe, Canon of Armagh, protested bitterly to Cardinal Antonelli of Propaganda in April 1784 at the conduct of Dr.Maguire. The incumbent priests of the diocese also resented the favours shown to the Franciscans and showed their resentment by killing Maguire's horse and setting fire to his house. When he succeeded as bishop of Kilmore, the Penal Laws against Catholics had resulted in the three previous bishops of Kilmore being non-residents of the Diocese due to fear of arrest, with the result that Dr.Maguire had a huge task on his hands to restore discipline among the Kilmore clergy and to provide new churches and schools. Up until his appointment the clergy were in hiding and the Catholic churches were converted to Protestant worship. Masses were said at Mass-Rocks or in barns in remote locations. The churches he caused to be built in Kilmore were Tullaghan (Kinlough) in 1770, Inishmagrath 1770, Laragh 1770, Kilmainhamwood 1775, Cavan 1774, Knocktemple (Castlerahan) 1780, Ballyconnell 1780, Bunnoe 1780, Tierworker 1788, Kildallan 1785, Killeshandra 1790, Ballinagh 1790, Killoughter 1790, Glenade 1790, Kilargue 1791, Corronea reconstructed 1795, Kildoagh 1797 & Derrylin 1797. These were mostly single cell barn churches and the best preserved example is the old disused Holy Trinity church in Kildoagh, Templeport.Kildoagh Barn Church. Templeport Development Association. Retrieved on 10 March 2010. He also founded four Latin schools in the diocese including Laragh Latin School. Dr. Maguire tried to keep on the good side of the Protestant Ascendancy. In 1778 he was the chief signatory of an address from 'The Catholics of County Fermanagh', signed by 24 persons to King George III offering support for his war against Revolutionary France. When the Franciscans vacated Lisgoole Monastery in County Fermanagh, one of their chalices was given to Dr.Maguire. It is a magnificent silver chalice which was presented to the Franciscans by Captain Sir Bryan Maguire in 1739 and bears the Maguire Arms and is inscribed in two consecutive lines on the convex surface of the base as follows; \\"This chalice was given by Sir Bryan Maguire, Knight of the Noble Order of St.Louis, for the use of ye Convent of Lisgool, in ye County of Fermanagh, near Inniskilling. Anno Domini 1739. Pray for his intention\\". On the death of Dr. Maguire the chalice passed to his brother Philip Maguire of Enniskillen who died in 1806 and it is now in the parish church of Cloonclare, Manorhamilton, County Leitrim. An inscribed presentation silver drinking goblet which also belonged to Dr. Maguire is kept in St.Patrick's College, Cavan. The strain of reorganising the diocese told on Dr. Maguire's health and in 1792 he was given a Coadjutor in the person of Reverend Charles O'Reilly, who was appointed as such with the title of Bishop of Fussala, in partibus, on 17 May 1793. Death Dr. Maguire died at Enniskillen, County Fermanagh on 23 December 1798 at the age of 77 and was succeeded as Bishop of Kilmore by Dr. Charles O'Reilly. Dr. Maguire was buried in the cemetery attached to the Church of Saint Molaise on Devinish Island in Loch Erne, County Fermanagh, beside the graves of his brothers Bryan and James Maguire. His gravestone, a massive horizontal slab close to the south wall of the church, is still visible and reads :Erected in memory of the :late Most Rev. Doctor Dennis Maguire :Catholic Bishop of Dromore :Who was translated to Kilmore :Who departed this life on the :23rd day of December in the year of :Our Lord 1798. Aged 77 years. :During which period he lived :a most exemplary life with :indefatigable zeal and charity :to mankind. He was indeed :the Good Shepherd. A true :and real follower of his Master :and a most affectionate and :sincere friend. Dr. Maguire's portrait hangs on the walls of St. Patrick's College, Cavan. Will and Testament Dr. Maguire's will and testament, which is dated 20 May 1798, was proved on 3 January 1799, by his brother and nephew, Philip and Denis Maguire, in the Diocesan Court of Clogher and is kept in the Public Records Office in Dublin. It reads as follows: In the Name of God. Amen.

The organization is open to \\"All good men of every age and circumstance who have an interest in the early Utah Pioneers. It is not necessary to have pioneer ancestry to join.\\"Information page at Sons of Utah Pioneers website Nephi L. Morris The Sons of Utah Pioneers was officially organized in 1933. The first National president was Lawrence T. Epperson. He was succeeded by Nephi L. Morris, who was also president of the Salt Lake Stake of the LDS Church at the time. In 1947, during the centennial of the entry of the first Mormon pioneers into the Great Salt Lake valley, the Sons of Utah Pioneers organized an elaborate commemorative journey of the original Mormon trek to Utah. Prominent Mormon writer and newspaper publisher Wendell J. Ashton was the National president of the SUP at that time. In 1982 a national headquarters building was completed in the East Mill Creek area of Salt Lake City. Administrative offices and a print library are housed there, as well as meeting rooms for local and national events. Membership is divided into chapters where members meet, usually monthly, to hear speakers on subjects of interest in history, geography, biography, as well as topics on Mormon culture. Chapters often organize \\"treks\\" lasting one day to a week where members travel to historical sites to learn more about pioneer history, as well as to socialize with others of like interests. The Sons of Utah Pioneers publish the quarterly Pioneer magazine, a full-color print publication containing historical articles, photographs and artwork about the Mormon Pioneers as a group, the individuals and families who comprised the Mormon Pioneers, and the places they settled. The organization sponsors an annual historical symposium at the headquarters building in Salt Lake City, and periodic regional history symposiums in other areas of the intermountain west.

A joint Spanish- Portuguese fleet under Admiral Oquendo defeated the Dutch after a six-hour naval battle.Wilson, p. 662 Background On 5 May 1631 Basque Spanish Admiral Oquendo left Lisbon with a fleet of about 20 men-of-war. He carried reinforcements to Para√≠ba, Pernambuco and Bahia. On his way back to Portugal, he was to convoy ships loaded with sugar. So as to allow the Dutch extra time to get ready, he headed first for Bahia. Once the Dutch learned of his coming, their fleet in Pernambuco, led by admiral Adrian Pater, sailed to intercept the Spanish convoy. Despite Pater had 33 ships at Pernambuco, he left 17 in port as he considered only 8 of Oquendo's to be battleworthy.Guthrie, William P.: Naval actions of the Thirty Years' War. The Mariner's mirror, 87:3, 2010, p. 265. Finally, on September 12, the two fleets met around the cays. Ships involved De Oquendo exited Ba√≠a de Todos os Santos with his 44-gun, 900-ton flagship Santiago de Oliste and 28-gun, 700-ton vice-flagship San Antonio; 30-gun Nuestra Se√±ora de la Concepci√≥n; 28-gun Nuestra Se√±ora del Buen Suceso; 26-gun Nuestra Se√±ora de la Anunciada;24-gun San Carlos; 22-gun San Buenaventura; 20-gun San Blas, San Francisco and San Pedro,; 18-gun San Bartolom√©, and San Mart√≠n; plus the requisitioned French pinnaces Lion Dor√© of 10 guns (renamed San Antonio), and Saint Pierre of 8 guns (renamed San pedro). These Spanish men-of-war are accompanied by the 28-gun Portuguese warship S√£o Jorge; 20-gun Santiago; 19.gun S√£o Jo√£o Baptista; 18-gun Nossa Senhora dos Prazeres (Maior), and Nossa Senhora dos Prazeres (Menor); plus the unarmed Nossa Senhora da Boa Nova, Nossa Senhora do Roz√°rio, Santo Ant√≥nio, Santa Cruz, and S√£o Jer√≥nimo. This force was protecting ten unarmed Brazilian caravels bearing 1,200 troops under the Neapolitan-born Cmdr. Giovanni Vincenzo de San Felice, Conde de Bagnuoli, intended to reinforce the town of Para√≠ba in addition to 20 Lisbon-bound sugar merchantmen. Standing away from the coast, the entire formation was driven southeast by contrary winds and currents into the vicinity of the Abrolhos (rocks off Brazil at about 18 degrees south latitude, their name deriving from the Portuguese phrase \\"abre olhos-eyes open-intended\\" as a warning of the half-submerged dangers). On the evening of 11 September the Iberian fleet was sighted by Admiral Pater, who prepared for action overnight. During Pater's voyage two of his ships became separated, leaving the Dutch admiral with his 46-gun, 1,000-ton flagship of the Dutch fleet Prins Willem and 50-gun, 800-ton Vice-flagship Geunieerde Provintien; 38-gun Provincie Ultrecht; 34-gun Walcheren; 32-gun Griffoen, and Groeningen; 30-gun Hollandia, and Oliphant; 28-gun Amersfoort, and Goeree; 26-gun Mercurius; 24-gun Dordrecht; 22-gun Medemblik; 20-gun Fortuijn, and ; plus 14-gun Niew Nederlandt. Battle At first light the admiral summoned his captains for final instructions, then drank a toast of Brunswick beer to the day's success. The Dutch admiral Pater had formed his fleet in two lines, Its place was taken by the much larger Concepci√≥n of Capt. Juan de Prado. Pater bore down in faint east-northeasterly breezes upon de Oquendo, who was distant, having ordered his 17 Spanish and Portuguese galleons to interpose in a half-moon crescent between the enemy and the convoy. Five ships out of sight to the rear because they had not received the orders of Admiral Oquendo: Anunciada, Buenaventura, San Carlos, San Bartolom√©, and the flagship of admiral Massibradi, of the Castilian naval Squadron. The Dutch do not see them and instead maneuver to engage the rest of the Spanish fleet.Victor san Juan: Grandes batallas navales desconocidas. Ed. Nowtillus, madrid 2016. Pg. 94 Fighting began around midmorning, when Vice Admiral de Vallecilla's San Antonio opened fire on Thijssen's advancing Geunieerde Provintien, which closed into board along with Provincie Ultrecht. About 15 minutes later de Oquendo and four other galleons opened fire on Pater's flagship, which steered directly toward Santiago de Oliste with Walcheren. The Dutch held their opening broadsides until point-blank range, then fired and grappled. A murderous engagement erupted around each flagship and vice-flag, both sides firing repeatedly into their opponents and yet unable to board. The smallest Portuguese galleon, Nossa Senhora dos Prazeres of Capt. Cosme do Couto Barbosa attempted to support Santiago de Oliste, only to drift helplessly beneath the combined guns of Prins Willem and Walcheren and be sunk. Its place was taken by the much larger Concepci√≥n of Capt. Juan de Prado. Around this time, Admiral Massibradi arrives with his five ships, tipping the balance towards the Spaniards, but the fight is still fierce.Victor san Juan: Grandes batallas navales desconocidas. Ed. Nowtillus, madrid 2016. Pg. 95 About 4 pm, a shot from de Oquendo's flagship started a blaze aboard Prins Willem, which the Spanish admiral cleverly directed his musketeers to fire at, so as to hamper Dutch fire-fighting efforts. The flames gained hold and finally drove Pater into the water, along with a few survivors, where he drowned. About this same time, de Vallecilla's vice-flag, San Antonio, broke up and went down by its stern, taking most of the complement, while its Dutch foe Provincie Ultrecht sheered off in flames and was later sunk. Thijsen's Geunieerde Provintien was battered but in possession of a single prize ‚ÄìBuenaventura of Capt. Alonso de Alarc√≥n y Molina, who had sailed to San Antonios side during the fighting, only to lose his life and ship. The remaining Dutch vessels were content to fire from long range ‚ÄìHollandia, Amersfoort, and Fortuijn being the only others to become closely engaged-while the Spaniards responded in kind. Aftermath The day ended in a Spanish-Portuguese victory, although depending on the sources Spanish losses may have been somewhat greater. According to David Marley, a Vice-flagship and galleon were sunk and another was taken, with 585 dead and missing (240 of these aboard the captured Buenaventura) plus 201 wounded. The Dutch flagship and another man-of-war disappeared beneath the waves, leaving 350 dead and missing plus more than 80 seriously wounded. According to Miguel Esquerdo Galiana, the Dutch fleet lost 2,000 men and three galleons.Esquerdo Galiana, Miguel: Espa√±a cara al mar. Valencia: Artes Gr√°f. Soler, 1963, p. 205 Thijssen showed no inclination to renew action the next day, preferring to limp back to Recife with his mauled fleet on 21‚Äì22 September. De Oquendo meanwhile deposited his reinforcements at Barra Grande of Porto Calvo ‚Äìonly 700 of them actually reach Fort Arrail do Bom Jesus‚Äì before continuing toward Europe with his sugar convoy. The Dutch garrison at Pernambuco subsequently evacuated Olinda in November in order to concentrate its strength around Recife.

However, much less emphasis is placed on breakfast, and breakfast itself is often skipped or involves lighter meal portions than are seen in other non-Mediterranean Western countries. Late-morning and mid-afternoon snacks, called merenda (plural merende), are also often included in this meal structure. Italians also commonly divide a celebratory meal into several different courses. Daytime meal structure=Breakfast (Colazione) A typical cup of cappuccino at breakfast. Italian breakfast (prima colazione) consists of caff√® latte (hot milk with coffee) or coffee with bread or rolls with butter and jam. A cookie-like rusk hard bread, called fette biscottate, and cookies are commonly eaten. Children drink caff√® d'orzo, hot chocolate, plain milk, or hot milk with very little coffee. If breakfast is eaten in a bar (coffee shop), it is composed of cappuccino and cornetto or espresso and pastry. Other products, such as breakfast cereals, fruit salad (macedonia), muesli and yogurt, are becoming increasingly common as part of the meal. However, Italian breakfasts vary by region and by season. In some regions, such as Tuscany and Umbria, in the past, people used to drink red wine (notably Chianti) into which they would dip their biscuits. Uovo sbattuto is another ubiquitous Italian breakfast item that utilizes egg and sugar and sometimes served atop caff√®. It is also very common for Italians to have a quick breakfast snack during the middle of the morning (typically a tramezzino or bread roll). Lunch (Pranzo) An Insalata Caprese, a cold dish which might be consumed at a lunch in Italy during the hot summer. Lunch is usually regarded as the most important meal. Most shops close for the pausa pranzo (lunch break) between 13:00 and 15:00. In most schools, children are given a lunch break when they can go home for lunch, or eat at the school cafeteria, or eat a packed lunch. Since the introduction of fast foods, takeaways and frozen and tinned foods, Italians tend to eat less home-made food but fresh food is still quite common and most people buy bread, milk and other foods daily. Many adults still make their own food (e.g., tomato sauce from their own tomatoes) and takeaways are not very frequent. A typical Italian lunch consists of a first course il primo (pasta, rice or similar), a second-course il secondo (meat or fish) served together with a side dish il contorno (vegetable or salad), fruit, dessert and coffee. Commuters and other workers tend to eat less often at home but instead, have a quick meal in a restaurant or pizzeria. Many foreign fast-food chains operate in Italy, especially in big cities and along motorways. Italian fast-food chains, like Autogrill, are also prevalent, often featuring versions of local dishes. Mid-afternoon snack (Merenda) Many children and adults have a mid-afternoon snack called merenda, generally consumed after school or in mid-afternoon. This may include a wide variety of foods. Merenda is often similar to breakfast, and might consist of a hot milky drink with bread and honey/jam or brioches; other foods are also eaten, such as yogurt, gelato, granita, fruit salad (or just fruit), nuts, biscuits and cookies, cake, sweets, etc. Supper (Cena) For cena, people tend to eat sometimes a primo or a soup, sometimes a secondo. Formal meal structure An Italian- style antipasto. A Lombard brasato di maiale (pork stew) is considered a second course. A little cup of espresso coffee which would be consumed after the meal. A structure of an Italian meal in its full form, usually performed during festivities. ;Aperitivo : The aperitivo opens a meal, and it is similar to an appetizer. Most people gather around standing up and have alcoholic/non- alcoholic drinks such as wine, prosecco, spritz, vermouth, and . Occasionally small amounts of food are consumed, such as olives, crisps, nuts, cheese, sauce dips, little quiches or similar snacks. ;Antipasto : The antipasto is a slightly heavier starter. It is usually cold and lighter than the first course. Examples of foods eaten are salumi (such as salame, mortadella, prosciutto, bresaola and other charcuterie products), cheeses, sandwich-like foods (panino, bruschetta, crostino), marinated vegetables or fish, cold salmon or prawn cocktails; more elaborate dishes are occasionally prepared. ;Primo : A primo is the first course. It consists of hot food and is usually heavier than the antipasto, but lighter than the second course. Non-meat dishes are the staple of any primo piatto: examples are risotto, pasta, seafood or vegetarian sauces, soup and broth, gnocchi, polenta, crespelle, casseroles, or lasagne. ;Secondi : This course may include different meats and types of fish, including turkey, sausage, pork, steak, stew, beef, zampone, salt cod, stockfish, salmon, lobster, lamb, chicken, or a roast. The primo or the secondo piatto may be considered more important depending on the locality and the situation. ;Contorno (side dish): A contorno is a side dish and it's commonly served alongside a secondo piatto. These usually consist of vegetables, raw or cooked, hot or cold. They are usually served on a separate dish, not on the same plate as the meat as in northern European style of presentation. ;Insalata : If the contorno contained many leafy vegetables, the salad might be omitted. Otherwise, a fresh garden salad could be served at this point. ;Formaggi e frutta : An entire course is dedicated to local cheeses and fresh seasonal fruit. The cheeses will be whatever is typical of the region (see List of Italian cheeses). ;Dolce : Next follows the dolce, or dessert. Frequent dishes include tiramisu, panna cotta, cake or pie, panettone or pandoro (the last two are mainly served at Christmas time) and the Colomba Pasquale (an Easter cake). A gelato or a sorbetto can be eaten too. Though there are nationwide desserts, popular across Italy, many regions and cities have local specialties. In Naples, for instance, zeppole and rum baba are popular; in Sicily, cassata and cannoli are commonly consumed; mostarda, on the other hand, is more of a Northern dish. ;Caff√® : Coffee is often drunk at the end of a meal, even after the digestivo. Italians do not have milky coffees or drinks after meals (such as cappuccino or caff√® macchiato), but strong coffee such as espresso, which is often drunk very quickly in small cups while still hot. ;Digestivo : The digestivo, also called ammazzacaff√® if served after the coffee, is the drink to conclude the meal. Drinks such as grappa, amaro, limoncello or other fruit/herbal drinks are drunk. Digestivo indicates that the drinks served at this time are meant to ease digestion of a long meal.

His sire, Cat Dreams, is a son of the influential stallion Storm Cat. His dam, Mons Venus, is by Maria's Mon, the American Champion Two-Year- Old Male Horse of 1995 who won the Sanford Stakes, the Champagne Stakes, and the Belmont Futurity Stakes. Maria's Mon also sired Kentucky Derby winners Monarchos and Super Saver. Caracortado is owned by 25px Blahut Racing, LLC & Lo Hi Racing, and is bred and trained by Mike Machowsky. Racing career Caracortado (Spanish for ‚Äúscarface‚Äú), a specialist on turf, was named as a juvenile by Machowsky for a scar down the middle of his head. Caracortado's sire, Cat Dreams, previously stood for a $1,500 stud fee. The chestnut Californian-bred gelding went undefeated through his first four starts at age two, capped by a victory in the 2009 California Breeders' Champion Stakes. At three, Caracortado won the 2010 Robert B. Lewis Stakes (G2), establishing himself as among the better three-year-old colts in North America when he drew off to a length score over highly regarded sophomores Dave In Dixie, American Lion, and Tiz Chrome. With this win, the grandson of Storm Cat moved his career record to five wins in five starts. Caracortado lost his perfect status when he finished third in the San Felipe Stakes (G2) to Sidney's Candy and Interactif. A troubled fourth in the Santa Anita Derby (G1) in April, he lacked sufficient graded earnings to enter the Kentucky Derby, and he then finished seventh in the Preakness Stakes (G1). Following a six-month freshening after the Preakness, Caracortado returned under new rider Joe Talamo with a win in his turf debut in a November 11 optional claiming race at Hollywood Park, defeating older rivals in near-record time. Entered in the December 26 Malibu Stakes (G1) on dirt at Santa Anita Park, he finished third to track record-setter Twirling Candy and Smiling Tiger. On January 29, 2011, he returned to grass as a newly turned four-year-old in the Sunshine Millions Turf with a win in fast time over older graded stakes winners The Usual Q.T., Presious Passion, and Jeranimo. Bet to the 6/5 favorite in a field of ten for the grade one Frank E. Kilroe Mile Handicap, he came from far back to just miss in a photo finish to Fluke in the fastest turf mile of the Santa Anita meeting. He skipped an international campaign through the spring and focused on top North American grass races leading up to the November Breeders Cup at Churchill Downs.

Dolphin Pro I The Dolphin Pro I is a neck-through bass with a 'hidden neck' design, specialized by Warwick (bass guitar). The body and the neck are made of ovangkol wood. For everything from percussive playing to fingerstyle, the Dolphin's sound still loses nothing in fullness and warmth. The \\"D-bass\\" has 26 frets, has active J/TJ pickups (MEC), a 2-band preamp, and weighs from 4.5 to 4.8 kilograms. The rhombus-inspired body design makes for a well balanced bass when playing, and has since its introduction remained a premium model in the Warwick catalogue. Dolphin SN The Dolphin SN (TCS) is a bass patented by the company, but now discontinued. SN presented 'Set Neck', which gave it a new look and a lower price. To achieve its tonal characteristic, Afzelia was used for the body wood, the same wood used for the Streamer Stage II bass. TCS (Tone Chamber System) was inserted into the body that made the bass lighter (and thus more comfortable to play) and should have brought out Afzelia's full potential to reality. However, with all its advantages, it wasn't selling as much as its sister bass, so this model was discontinued. Dolphin Pro 2 Another discontinued Dolphin model was a more affordable model called the Pro 2 with bolt-on necks made of maple. It had two J-pickups in a more standard position and did not feature the Dolphin inlays on the fingerboard. It was introduced around 1990 and discontinued in 1999. After an attempt at making these basses in Germany in which 2-300 basses were deemed not worthy of the Warwick logo, the production was moved to Japan (Morris \\"Morridaira\\" - MMI) which had experience crafting quality instruments at a more affordable price than was possible for Warwick in Germany. The Japanese instruments were highly regarded as a quality, affordable version of the Dolphin with the real W for Warwick on the headstock. History The earliest Dolphin Pro 1 models from 1989 and 1990 were equipped with a Bartolini single coil pickup at the neck- and Bartolini humbucker at the bridge position. Since 1991 Warwick switched to the then available MEC Twinjazz at bridge position and a MEC single coil at neck position, drastically changing the tone of the Pro 1 model to a more modern and growly one. In 1991 there was also a limited run of broad neck five string Dolphin Pro 1 models which had Bartolini soapbar switchable coil pickups at both neck and bridge positions, of which only the bridge pickup coil mode can be switched. The woods of the Dolphin also has changed over the years. Earlier the Dolphins had hand shaped boir√© (since 2006 on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species) bodies with wenge necks with laminated zebrano stripes and a wenge fingerboard. Also some were made with maple in the bodies. The bass could be ordered in 4 and 5-string models, a 6 string model wasn't introduced until 2012. Notable players * Dick L√∂vgren, the bass player of extreme metal band Meshuggah since 2004 owns five Dolphin five-string basses (four SN and one Pro I model). Although he owns a wide selection of fretted and fretless Warwick basses, his black custom Dolphin SN five-string is his favoured bass and is his main bass for studio recordings and live performances. *Kayleigh Marchant, the bass player of the celtic folk rock band The Dolmen.Her favorite bass on stage is a Warwick Dolphin Pro I.

He held senior ministerial positions in the government, most notably as Minister for Air during the Second World War. Guest was born in Grahamstown, Cape Colony. His grandfather had moved the family there, leaving Kidderminster, England, where it had been in the printing business for three generations. He saw active service in the Second Boer War, enlisting despite being underage, and again in the First World War, when he was injured in France. His legal career began while back in Southern Rhodesia between those two wars. He won a case against Sir Charles Coghlan, at the time Premier of Southern Rhodesia, and Coghlan invited him to become a partner in his firm, which became known as Coghlan, Welsh & Guest. On his return from the First World War, Guest took responsibility for the Salisbury practice. He was elected to the Legislative Assembly in 1928 as a member of Coghlan's Rhodesia Party, representing the constituency of Charter, which he held until 1946. He first became a cabinet minister in Godfrey Huggins' government, appointed Minister of Mines and Public Works in June 1938. During the Second World War, Guest was Minister for Air and administered the Rhodesia Air Training Group. After the war he was also Minister of Defence, Minister of Finance and Leader of the House. At the 1946 elections he stood for Salisbury Gardens and held the seat until his retirement from office in 1948. He married Edith May Jones and had two daughters and twin sons, both of whom were killed in action during the Second World War. At his death, both the High Court and Parliament paid public tributes to him. His continuing legacy is most evident in the Kariba Dam, a project that went ahead with his active support.  Early life  Ernest Lucas Guest was born in Grahamstown, Cape Colony (in modern South Africa's Eastern Cape province) on 20 August 1882. Guest's grandfather had moved the family to South Africa in 1861 from Kidderminster, England, where they had been involved in the printing business for three generations. His grandfather was appointed manager of the Frontier Times, printed and published in Grahamstown. The family resided there until 1889 when Ernest's father, Herbert Melville Guest, moved them to Klerksdorp, Transvaal, after buying the local newspaper and printing business.  Military career = Second Boer War  At the outbreak of the Second Boer War in 1899, Guest was below the minimum age of 18 for enlisting. He nevertheless managed to join the First City Volunteers, a Grahamstown regiment in which his father had served. Its task of guarding a bridge over a railway line was unappealing, so he took the opportunity of joining the Eastern Province Light Horse, attached to the Highland Brigade, which was recruiting volunteers who could both ride and shoot. Early in the Brigade's advance into the Orange Free State on its way to the relief of Kimberley, Guest got food poisoning and he returned to Grahamstown. After recovering, he joined the Kimberley Mounted Corps and guided two officers from Lichtenburg to Klerksdorp, where they persuaded the Boers to surrender by bluffing that a strong British force was following close behind. The Boers soon retook the town and Guest was captured. He was sent with other prisoners to Pietersburg to be executed but he managed to escape and travelled to Warmbaths. After satisfying the authorities that he had actually been taken prisoner and had not surrendered voluntarily, he returned to his depot at Kimberley. His unit had been disbanded and he was discharged. Guest joined up again, enlisting in Kitchener's Fighting Scouts on 2 January 1901.The National Archives (TNA): Public Record Office (PRO) WO 126/78 War Office service records for the Boer War He was given the rank of Sergeant, chasing Boer commandoes without success. He was recommended for a commission and posted to the Johannesburg Mounted Rifles, whose Colonel decided that Guest was too young to lead a force composed of miners who were considerably older than him. Returning to Klerksdorp, Guest learned that the Bechuanaland Rifles were recruiting experienced officers; he went to Mafeking and was accepted into the unit, with whom he served until the end of the war. The Rifles were part of a mobile force, the Divisional Scouting Corps, whose function was to round up Boer detachments and to execute Kitchener's scorched earth policy, destroying Boer farm buildings and crops, and detaining women and children in concentration camps.  First World War  The original Rhodesian Platoon of the alt=A formative photograph of soldiers in First World War British uniforms, standing and sitting in six rows. A gentleman in civilian clothes sits in the centre of the second row from the front. Great Britain declared war on Germany on 4 August 1914, and as part of the British Empire, Southern Rhodesia was also now at war. The British South Africa Company (which then administered the territory) took no steps to aid recruiting for the forces, so many men paid their own fares to England to join up. A number of eligible recruits could not afford to go, so Guest, together with Captain Alwyn Knowles of the Bedfordshire Regiment, who as a reserve officer was awaiting his call-up, organised a private fund to pay their passages. When the recruits arrived in England they were enlisted by Captain (later Colonel) John Banks Brady (who was in 1934 to be elected to the Southern Rhodesian Legislative Assembly as member for Bulawayo North) to form a Rhodesian platoon in the King's Royal Rifle Corps. Guest and Knowles were summoned to the Defence Department and told to stop recruiting. The Administration had decided to raise a regiment in Rhodesia, and Guest joined the Salisbury battalion of the 1st Rhodesian Regiment with the rank of Lieutenant.The National Archives (TNA): Public Record Office (PRO) WO 372/8/176444 Medal Card of Guest, Ernest Lucas, 1914‚Äì1920 The battalion was sent to South Africa to assist in suppressing the 1914 Maritz Rebellion by Boers opposed to fighting for Britain. It was not, however, deployed against the Rebellion and when it ended the battalion was sent, with the Imperial Light Horse, to reinforce the South African troops in the South-West Africa Campaign in German South-West Africa, present-day Namibia. They landed at Lambert's Bay on Christmas morning 1914, but made no contact with the enemy until they were sent to Swakopmund. When the campaign came to an end, the battalion returned to Salisbury. Guest then travelled to England and sought a commission, joining the South Lancashire Regiment with the rank of Lieutenant in September 1916. He was later promoted to Captain. He went with his battalion to France where they were posted to the 59th Division, then in the line. The sector they occupied was not very active, but shelling and sniping from both sides were carried out fairly regularly. It was not long before Guest was wounded, and then he fell victim to an irritating and persistent skin complaint which was common in the trenches and did not respond to treatment. He was evacuated to England and after a brief period in hospital was sent to the Imperial Hydro at St Annes, where he was told that he would not be fit to return to his unit for six months. Through a contact at the War Office, Guest had his name added to a list of officers available for special employment, and was selected to undertake a propaganda tour of the United States, delivering 160 lectures to approximately 282,000 people in total. He was then sent to France to promote the benefits of Southern Rhodesia to the large number of soldiers who had become unsettled and wished to emigrate. Guest then returned to Rhodesia with his family, who had spent most of the war in England. Other members of the Guest family also served in the First World War. Ivor Guest, Ernest's eldest brother, was a lieutenant in the Witwatersrand Rifles in the South-West Africa Campaign. After the regiment was disbanded at the end of the campaign, he was commissioned as a machine gun officer in the Second Cape Corps for service in East Africa; he was killed in action on 6 November 1917 at the Battle of Mahiwa while checking the advance of a vastly superior enemy force. His gun crew had become casualties and he was handling the gun himself when he was killed. Guest's two younger brothers also served in the Transvaal Scottish. The elder of them, Duke, was later commissioned in the South African Scottish and served in France. He was gassed and after a long stay in hospital was declared unfit for further service and remained in England until the end of the war.  Legal career = Admission to the Rhodesian High Court  At the start of the Second Boer War, Guest had left school without any educational qualifications. Nevertheless, he managed to start his legal career when a Klerksdorp solicitor, Maurice Rood, offered him a job drawing up claims for compensation by farmers whose properties had been destroyed or damaged by the British forces. The claims were to be submitted to the \\"Compensation Committee\\", on which Guest's father served. When the committee ceased to function Rood suggested that Guest become articled to him. The need to matriculate was an obstacle. He used a family connection with St. Andrew's College, Grahamstown, to attend as a day boy and passed his matriculation. He duly applied to the Supreme Court for admission as an attorney in the Transvaal, was accepted and took the oath. He was offered a post with the leading firm of attorneys in Klerksdorp, but a clause in his articles prohibited Guest from practising in competition with Rood's firm for some years without the latter's permission. Guest became acquainted with Fred Hopley, who had recently been practising in Bulawayo. He informed Guest that a solicitor in Bulawayo, Louis Champion, wanted someone to take over his practice for six months while he was away on a shooting trip. Guest's application was accepted by return of post and he was asked to report early in July 1910. Champion's practice, as Deputy Sheriff, consisted mainly of debt- collecting and lending money to doubtful borrowers at a high rate of interest. Guest prepared his petition for admission to the Rhodesian High Court and briefed counsel to represent him before the Chief Justice, Sir Joseph Vintcent. The Judge dispensed with the requirement to apply first for admission in the Cape Colony and admitted him as an attorney of the High Court of Southern Rhodesia. A few days after Guest's arrival a young man arrived to practise in Bulawayo as an advocate, Robert Hudson. So began a friendship that was to endure for the rest of Hudson's life and through many vicissitudes ‚Äì in the legal profession, on active service in the First World War, and during the years when they were both members of the Cabinet. Hudson, who for some years was Minister of Justice, became Chief Justice of Southern Rhodesia.  Coghlan, Welsh & Guest  Bryce Hendrie, whose office was next door to Louis Champion's, had been appointed commanding officer of the Rhodesian contingent to attend the coronation of King George V on 22 June 1911. Before his departure to England, he offered Guest the management of his practice during his absence. Hendrie's brother was an estate agent and put all his property transfers through the firm, so Guest gained much valuable experience, especially in conveyancing, through a number of cases in the High Court, in the Magistrate's Court and in the Court of the Mining Commissioner. Guest came up against Sir Charles Coghlan, the senior partner of Coghlan and Welsh, in a case before the Court of the Mining Commissioner. Coghlan represented a mining company, which had pegged some gold claims on Guest's client's farm. The Commissioner gave judgment in favour of Guest, who had been instructed to oppose their registration. Following this case, although initially irritated by Guest, Coghlan invited him to join his firm in Salisbury, which Guest did in January 1912. The Salisbury office had been opened by Bernard Tancred. His passing away provided the opportunity for Guest to join the firm as a partner. For a while, the firm was known as Coghlan, Welsh, Townsend and Guest, when Townsend, one of the 1820 Settlers in the Eastern Cape, joined the firm in Salisbury. It reverted to Coghlan, Welsh and Guest, when Townsend died a little time later. On his return to Rhodesia after the First World War, Guest took over the Salisbury practice from Sir Charles, who returned to Bulawayo.  Politics = Early career  After the First World War, Guest became involved in municipal affairs. He served on a committee to help returning soldiers adjust to civilian life. He was elected to the Salisbury Town Council, and during his second term was appointed Deputy Mayor. For the best part of a year, he acted as Mayor during the Mayor's absence in the United States. Guest was one of several prominent citizens who were members of the Rhodesian Union Association, advocating joining the Union of South Africa in the 1922 government referendum; the alternative option was \\"responsible government\\", under which Southern Rhodesia would become a self-governing colony of Britain in its own right. The electorate returned a vote for the latter proposition, and in October 1923 Coghlan became the first Premier of Southern Rhodesia. Although Guest was on the opposite side to Coghlan the statesman was impressed by his capabilities, and when he drew up a list of those he would like to see stand for election to the next Legislative Assembly, just before his death, he put Guest's name at the head of it. Guest first stood for Charter, representing the Rhodesia Party at the 1928 elections. Despite the constituency being largely Afrikaans, he won the seat, defeating the incumbent Charles Edward Gilfillan of the Progressive Party with a majority of 283 votes to 211. He held Charter until 1946, being re-elected in 1933, 1934 (unopposed) and 1939. At the 1946 elections he stood for Salisbury Gardens and won, remaining there until his retirement from politics in 1948.  Cabinet Minister  At the 1933 elections, the Rhodesia Party was defeated by the Reform Party of Godfrey Huggins. Guest was a key advocate of accepting the merger of the two parties under the new name of the United Party and Huggins appointed him to his Cabinet in 1938. Guest was Minister of Mines and Public Works, from 1 June 1938 to 1 February 1944. The Electricity Supply Commission came under his portfolio. It had responsibility for ensuring that the generation of electricity kept pace with the ever¬∑growing needs of mining, farming and secondary industry. When Guest became Minister the Commission was constructing a thermal power station at Umsweswe, but kept running short of money. The Minister of Finance, Jacob Smit, was reluctant to grant further funds but would support a hydro-electric scheme. Guest proposed Kariba as a source of hydro-electric power and Smit provided the money for further investigation. Guest arranged with a civil engineer named Jeffares, who had earlier surveyed the route of the proposed Sinoia/Kafue railway and knew the country around Kariba, to survey the area, select a site for a power station and submit a report. When he eventually did so, Guest appointed a committee of engineers to examine the proposal. They reported favourably but did not recommend that the scheme be proceeded with immediately. Nor was the Cabinet particularly impressed, and the idea was strongly criticised by the Opposition in Parliament. The outbreak of the Second World War caused the project to be shelved but after the war the project was revived as a joint scheme to serve the two Rhodesias.  Second World War  C W Meredith AFC, in command of the Air Training Group (1941) At a special sitting of Parliament on 28 August 1939, Rhodesia determined to stand by Great Britain in the event that war should break out, as was expected. Of a white population of just 65,000, only 10,000 were fit and available for active service. It was decided not to create a full Rhodesian formation: if it were wiped out, the colony's future prosperity would be put at risk. Instead mostly small groups of Rhodesians were distributed throughout the British Army, the Royal Navy, and the Royal Air Force. In the Defence Report of 1939, it was stated that forces would be trained and organised not only for internal security and defence but also to defend British interests in service outside its borders. = Empire Air Training Scheme = As early as 1936, an air training scheme was inaugurated at Cranborne, near Salisbury, where the civilian flying school instructed pilots. Facilities were later extended to Bulawayo. In August 1937, Squadron Leader G.A Powell and Flight Lieutenant V.E. Maxwell were seconded from the RAF to oversee service training. In September 1939, the Rhodesian Air Training Group, under the direction of Air Vice Marshal (later Sir) Charles Warburton Meredith, took in 500 recruits at Cranborne. An offer was made to British Air Ministry to run a flying school and to train personnel to man three squadrons, which was duly accepted. The Southern Rhodesian Air Force effectively ceased to exist after its last training course was completed on 6 April 1940. Its three squadrons became 44, 237 and 266 Squadrons, Royal Air Force, bearing the name of Rhodesia. The Rhodesian Air Training Group invited the public to submit design proposals for the Squadrons' crests.  Rhodesia Air Training Group  Allied pilots training over Southern Rhodesia in 1943 Meanwhile, preparations were underway in Rhodesia to expand facilities for the training of pilots. In January 1940 the government announced the creation of a Department of Air, completely separate from that of Defence. Guest was appointed Minister of Air, a post he held from 28 March 1940 to 6 May 1946. He inaugurated and administered what became the second largest Empire Air Training Scheme, beginning with the establishment of three units at Salisbury, Bulawayo and Gwelo, each comprising a preliminary and an advanced training school. Rhodesia was the last of the Commonwealth countries to enter the Empire Air Training Scheme and the first to turn out fully qualified pilots. No.25 Elementary Flying Training School at Belvedere Air Station, Salisbury, was the first school to be opened, on 25 May 1940 by Air Chief Marshal Sir Robert Brooke-Popham. It was followed by a Service School at Cranborne. In Bulawayo, an Elementary School was established at Sauerdale, although due to the unsuitability of the ground surface, it was moved to Induna, with a Service School at Kumalo. Gwelo had an Elementary School at Guinea Fowl and a Service School at Thornhill. The Elementary Schools were equipped with Tiger Moths and the Service Schools, single-engine Harvards and twin-engine Airspeed Oxfords. At Moffat, the first gunners passed out in September 1941 from the only Bombing and Gunnery School in Southern Rhodesia. The trainees came mainly from Britain, but also from Australia, Canada, South Africa, New Zealand, USA, Yugoslavia, Greece, France, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Kenya, Uganda, Tanganyika, Fiji and Malta. In total 8,500 British aircrew were trained in Southern Rhodesia during the War.  237 (Rhodesia) Squadron  Fitters working on the engine of a Hawker Hurricane of No 237 (Rhodesian) Squadron in Iran. No. 1 Squadron, Southern Rhodesian Air Force, was among the units posted to East African Force in Kenya in September 1939 to undertake the role of army co-operation, including reconnaissance and air- photography work, as well as dive-bombing operations and ground-strafing, and conducting artillery shoots. On 22 April 1940, the squadron was renamed No. 237 (Rhodesia) Squadron, Royal Air Force and took the Latin motto Primum Agmen in Caelo (The Vanguard in the Sky), being Rhodesia's first in the field. In September 1940, 237 Squadron was relieved by units of the South African Air Force and redeployed in Sudan, where the Operations Record for the last three months of 1940 showed it was involved in reconnaissance, dive-bombing and pamphlet-dropping. At the start of 1941, the Squadron was re-equipped with less antiquated aircraft. The Hardys were replaced by Westland Lysander II army co-operation planes as well as Gloster Gladiator fighter biplanes. 237 Squadron moved out of East Africa after the defeat of the Italians in May 1941. They had seen active service in Kenya, Sudan, Eritrea and Abyssinia. The Squadron was involved in the Western Desert Campaign against Rommel. After a lull in the summer of 1941, it took heavy casualties in the closing months inflicted on it by Me109F and Macchis. It was withdrawn to the Canal Zone in February 1942 after five months in the Western Desert. The Squadron's crest was presented to it by Air Chief Marshal Sir Arthur Tedder on 30 March 1942.  266 (Rhodesia) Squadron  266 Squadron, RAF, was formed at RAF Sutton Bridge on 30 October 1939. The majority of the Squadron were Rhodesian, with the exception of a few groundstaff and the commanding officer. Equipped with Spitfires, it was the Rhodesian fighter squadron and it took as its motto a Sindebele word Hlabezulu (Stabber of Skies). It first went into action over Dunkirk on 2 June 1940. By June 1941, the Squadron, led by Sqn Ldr T.B. de la P. Beresford, was stationed at RAF Wittering, near Peterborough. Its duties included patrolling, escorting convoys, offensive sweeps of northern France and the Belgian and Dutch coasts, as well as escorting bombing raids over France and the Rhine. In January 1942, the Squadron received Hawker Typhoons and later in the month moved to Duxford.  44 (Rhodesia) Squadron  No.44 Sqn Avro Lancaster B.I (1942) 44 Squadron, RAF, stationed at Waddington, south of Lincoln, was renamed 44 (Rhodesia) Squadron in September 1941, and took as its motto Fulmina Regis Justa (The King's thunderbolts are righteous). The bomber Squadron, equipped with Hampdens, took part in raids on Berlin and many other targets, as well as mine-laying in sea traffic lanes. It was also in September 1941 that the Squadron received the proto-type Lancaster bomber, the first squadron of the RAF to receive the new aircraft. On a visit to the Squadron in December, Guest and Meredith were taken on a flight in the new plane. Although the order was given in December to cease operations in the Hampdens, it was not until 3 March 1942 that the Lancaster was put on active service on its first battle mission for the entire RAF. The Squadron, with its Lancasters, was given key targets to bomb: on 17 April 1942, six Lancasters from 44 Squadron alongside six from 97 Squadron, bombed the MAN diesel engine factory, which produced more than half of the German U-boats, as well as engines for ships, tanks and transport vehicles. The success ‚Äì at a cost of five planes and crew to 44 Squadron ‚Äì earned the thanks of the Prime Minister himself. The Squadron was further involved in the obliteration of Rostock on 8 May and took part in the 1,000-aircraft attack on Cologne on 30 May.  After the war  From 1944, Guest was Leader of the House until he retired from political office in 1948. He retained his wartime role as Air Minister and Rhodesia capitalised on her experience to form her own highly efficient Air Force. He also tackled the problem of young airmen returning to civilian life, training aircrews for civilian duty as well as helping young men complete their academic education. He continued as Minister of Defence and Air from 7 June 1946 to 15 September 1948. He chaired the South African Air Transport Council in its deliberations in 1947 regarding air traffic control and the establishment of control centres at Nairobi, Salisbury and Johannesburg, as well as communications and the future needs of air transport in southern Africa. During this time, he was also Minister of Internal Affairs from 1944 to 1946 and briefly Minister of Finance from 7 May 1946 to 26 September 1946. He acted as Prime Minister at various times in 1947 and 1948 during the absence of Huggins and acted for other ministers on a number of occasions. Although he had retired from political office, Guest continued to be active in public life, for example in organising the 1953 Rhodes Centenary Exhibition in Southern Rhodesia.  Family  Ernest Guest married Edith May, daughter of Thomas Jones of Singapore. The couple met in Johannesburg, where she had been brought up by an uncle. They had two daughters and twin sons. Both their sons were killed in action in the Second World War. His second daughter, Maureen Edith Pilling, enlisted in the Women's Auxiliary Air Force (WAAF) soon after the outbreak of the Second World War and was eventually promoted to Flight Officer in July 1944. Posted to Cairo and Palestine, she married a Squadron Leader in the RAF and then remained in Cairo until the end of the war. Ernest Melville Charles Guest (1920‚Äì4 October 1943) was commissioned as Pilot Officer in the Royal Air Force on 9 October 1939 and eventually promoted to Flight Lieutenant on 9 October 1941. He was initially posted to 206 Squadron in England, flying anti-submarine missions, then to 200 Squadron in West Africa before being transferred to 61 Air School at George in the Western Cape as a navigation instructor. He transferred back to England and soon after was killed in action. A fortnight later, his son, Melville Richard John Guest, was born. He received three Mentions in Despatches and was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross in 1942. John Desmond Thomas Guest (1920‚Äì21 November 1941), Melville's twin brother, turned down a Rhodes Scholarship at Trinity College, Oxford as the war broke out and enlisted in England instead,Rhodes House inscription commissioned Second Lieutenant in the King's Royal Rifle Corps in June 1940. He served in the Abyssinian campaign and then in the Western Desert, where he was killed in a bayonet charge at the Battle of Sidi Rezegh on 21 November 1941.  Honours  King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Guest was appointed OBE in the 1938 King's Birthday Honours List and KBE (Civil Division) in the 1944 New Year Honours List \\"for public services, especially in inauguration of Empire Air Training Scheme.\\" He was also appointed CVO by King George VI during the Royal Family's visit to Rhodesia in April 1947, and CMG in the 1949 New Years Honours List. Guest was also awarded Order of the White Eagle. He was granted the right in December 1948 to retain the title Honourable, having served for more than three years as a member of the Executive Council of Southern Rhodesia. The University of Witwatersrand, South Africa, recognised him with an Honorary Degree in 1953, Doctor of Laws.  Death  Sir Ernest Lucas Guest died on 20 September 1972 at the age of 90, in Salisbury, Rhodesia. A special sitting of both divisions of the High Court of Rhodesia was convened to pay tribute to Guest on 27 September 1972. In Parliament, a motion of condolence was moved on 14 November 1972 by Jack Howman, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Defence and Public Services ‚Äì and a partner in Coghlan, Welsh & Guest ‚Äì as Acting Leader of the House.

The centre of the garden is occupied by a sculpture, The Greek Runner, by Sir William Blake Richmond, which was erected in 1926. History The square was laid out during the economic boom of the 1820s, when the then owner, George Scott decided to build a speculative housing development on part of his Ravenscourt Park estate and also provided the land for St Peter's Church, Hammersmith. From 1827 plots were developed piecemeal by builders who undertook to conform to the master plan. The square was mostly complete by the end of the 1830s. The houses are mostly built in groups of three, with stucco fronts, pediments and Ionic porches. Some retain eagles, lions and dogs as decoration.

Hu (J. C. Hu, Dongchao Hu,ËÉ°Ê†ãÊúù or Zhenting Hu) (1872‚Äì1957) was a Chinese civil engineer, librarian, and writer. He worked on many of the early railroads in China. Birth and family background Theodone C. Hu was born in 1872 in Huangpu town, Haizhu District, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China. In 1757, the Qing Dynasty opened a harbor, the Ancient Huangpu Harbor, for international trading in this town. This harbor remained as the only international harbor in China until 1842. Theodone Hu's father Jianchu Hu (ËÉ°Âª∫Âàù) was the second son of Honggen Hu (ËÉ°ÂÆèÊ†π). Hu's uncle was Xuanze Hu(ËÉ°ÊóãÊ≥Ω).ËÉ°ÊóãÊ≥Ω (Hu's ancestors had moved from Chongan in Fujian to Huanpu town during the Yuan Dynasty.) In the mid- to late 19th century, Xuanze Hu was renowned as a community leader in Singapore, and therefore he was appointed as an overseas consul in Singapore. At the same time, Xuanze Hu was appointed as Consul of Russia and Japan in Singapore. He was made a baron by Australia and made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George by the British government. For all his success, Xuanze Hu was known simply as \\"Mister Huangpu\\" in Singapore. Streets and a school in Singapore are still named after Xuanze. Xuanze Hu also earned his respects and reputation in Singapore community by supporting garden developments, by his charity works, and by providing financial support for Raffles Girls' School. Xuanze thought it important to develop education programs for women, and this idea influenced Theodone's view of women. Early years Theodone Hu's father died when Hu was four years old. Thirteen years later, he went to Hong Kong and was raised by his uncle. He enrolled in Queen's College, Hong Kong when he turned 21 years old, in 1893. Education In 1897, Peiyang University, the first university in modern Chinese history, was founded in Tianjin. Theodone Hu passed the entrance exam in Hong Kong and studied in the university, where he earned his bachelor's degree in engineering. Theodone Hu graduated from Peiyang University in 1901, when he was 29 years old. Then he received scholarship to further his education in the United States. He first enrolled in the University of California and transferred in his fourth year (1904) to Cornell University, where he majored in building railroad and bridges. He wrote the book Comparison of column bridges and nail bridges („ÄäÊØîËæÉÊü±Ê°•ÂèäÈíâÊ°•‰πãÁî®„Äã) and earned his master's degree in civil engineering. He also wrote the book Rail Road of China („Ää‰∏≠ÂõΩÈìÅË∑ØÊåáÂçó„Äã), which brought him to the attention of Chinese railway companies. Return to China After his graduation, Theodone Hu worked for the Bians Yun Lisiya Railway Company to practice railroad measurement, for the American Bridge Company to practice bridge building and design, and for Poluyun Mechanics to practice building locomotives and drawing the designs for the machine parts. In 1906, Hu was invited by the governor of Sichuan, Liang Xi, to build railroads, and so he returned to China. His mother died on April 30, so he stayed in Huangpu town for three months. On the way to Sichuan on July 15, his friend told him that he should go to Beijing and take the Annual National Faculty Exam. He did so, scoring in ninth place out of all test-takers and receiving the title of jinshi from the emperor. Hu arrived at Sichuan in September, when he received a telegram from home saying that his wife had died. In November, Hu was appointed as an engineer on the Chuan-Han railroad in Sichuan. He led a group of about 20 people (seven assistant engineers, two committee members, seven janissaries) to survey the routes from Chengdu in Chongqing. However, he quit in 1907 due to disagreements with the company. The Chuan-Han railway was not built until 1949. Hu's route for the Chengdu‚ÄìChongqing Railway was eventually adopted and built in 1952. Hu then left for Nagasaki in Japan, then for Vladivostok, and finally Sweden. Under the Republic of China From 1914 to 1917, Theodone Hu was appointed a member of the Nanjing Ningxiang Railway Project Board and later as the Director of Beijing Railway Department. He led the survey for many routes, including the Jiang‚ÄìZhe railway, Hai‚ÄìJing railway, Qing‚ÄìXu railway, and Hang‚ÄìYong railway. He also drew the Zhejiang Railway General Map. In 1920, when Hu was 48 years old, he was appointed Project Head of the Yue‚ÄìHan Railway Supervising Department and took a survey of the Chao-shan railway. In 1922, he was appointed as an engineer in Guangdong Construction Highway Department and took the survey of the road from Chaoguan to Pingshi. From 1922 to 1927, Hu was worked as the Works Construction Section Chief. During this time, he designed and led the constructions of many roads in Guangzhou. Most of the roads in his native Haizhu District were built under his supervision. In 1932, when Hu was 60 years old, he was appointed head of the Guangjiu Railway Management Department in Guangdong. In 1945, at the age of 73, Hu returned to his hometown, Huangpu. There he taught boxing in the local elementary school. He also worked on translating foreign books about railways, planning to publish them. In 1962, Hu's grandson Zhonghua Hu donated his manuscripts to the library in South China University of Technology. Hu also wrote a letter to Jianying Ye, the chairman of Guangdong, and proposed road construction programs in south China. Under the People's Republic of China From 1950, Hu worked in the Guangdong Cultural Relics Preservation Committee and fulfilled his \\"dream of becoming a librarian\\". In 1955, he went back to his hometown, where he died of illness in 1957. Hu's home in Huangpu, called Dong Yuan, stands to this day.

Its location on the confluence of the River Liffey and the Rye Water has marked it as a frontier town historically: on the border between the ancient kingdoms of Leinster and Brega, as an outpost of The Pale, and on Kildare's border with County Dublin. As of 2016, the population of the town was 15,504. It is the fourth largest town in Kildare, and the 29th largest in Ireland. Name The placename comes from the Old Norse lax hlaup (Younger Futhark: ·õö·õÖ·öº·õã ·öº·õö·õÖ·ö¢·õí; ) which means \\"salmon leap\\". The name in Irish (L√©im an Bhrad√°in) is a direct translation of this, and was first adopted in the 1890s.Placenames Database of Ireland (see archival records) In Latin, it is Saltus salmonis, from which comes the names of the baronies of North Salt and South Salt. History Leixlip was a possible site of the Battle of Confey, in which the Viking King Sigtrygg Caech of Dublin defeated the Irish King of Leinster around the year 917. The first settlement at Leixlip was an outpost of Early Scandinavian Dublin, built at the furthest point where longships could be rowed up the Liffey. Its status as an outpost of Dublin continued for centuries, marking a border of The Pale. The town was home to Arthur Guinness's first brewery in 1755, where he brewed ales until he moved on to St. James's Gate Brewery, Dublin in 1759. The first history of the town was published in 2005.John Colgan, \\"Leixlip, County Kildare\\" (2005) Politics Leixlip is part of the Kildare North constituency, which elects four members to D√°il √âireann. Leixlip, with Celbridge, comprises the Celbridge-Leixlip electoral area, which elects seven members to Kildare County Council. Two of those members are based in Leixlip. Between 1988‚Äì2014 Leixlip had a nine-member Town Council (formerly Leixlip Town Commissioners), headed by a Cathaoirleach (chairperson). In 1990, the town's coat of arms was presented by minister P√°draig Flynn. The Local Government Reform Act 2014 abolished town councils, including Leixlip's, in 2014. Transport=Bus Dublin Bus provides services to Leixlip. Between the 66a, 66b, and 66e, Leixlip has bus service in either direction typically at 15-minute intervals. From Dublin city centre: the number 66 goes to Maynooth via Leixlip village; the 66a goes to Leixlip Confey via Leixlip village; and the 66b goes to Leixlip HP via Leixlip village. All buses have equivalent return routes back to Dublin. The 66x \\"Xpresso\\" provides express bus service from some parts of the town directly into Dublin City centre in the mornings, and return in the evenings. The 66n \\"Nitelink\\" provides a late- night service on Friday and Saturday night from Dublin City centre to Leixlip. The Airport Hopper provides services to and from Dublin Airport. Rail Leixlip is connected to the Irish railway network on the Dublin-Sligo railway line, running from Dublin Connolly to Sligo, with two stations, Leixlip (Louisa Bridge), opened on 1 September 1848, and Leixlip (Confey), opened on 2 July 1990, located at either end of the town. While InterCity services to Sligo do not serve the town, the Maynooth/Longford Commuter services do, the frequency of the trains peaking in the mornings and evenings. Some of these services continue outbound to Mullingar and Longford. Leixlip has the distinction of being the only town in the Republic of Ireland with two operational train stations. Main Street in Leixlip Air Weston Airport is a publicly licensed airport. Its traffic is primarily private and commercial training. Dublin Airport is 20 minutes away from Leixlip via the M50 motorway. Local attractions=Leixlip Castle Built on a rock at the confluence of the River Liffey and the Rye Water, the central part of the castle dates from 1172, just after the Norman Invasion of 1171 and is one of the oldest continuously-inhabited buildings in Ireland, pre-dating Dublin Castle by 30 years. It was used as a hunting base by King John when Lord of Ireland in 1185. It was not of major military importance but withstood a 4-day siege by the army of Edward Bruce in 1316. Leixlip and 809 acres around it (excluding the castle) were bought by William Conolly of nearby Castletown House for approximately ¬£12,000 in 1728. The castle was bought by Conolly's nephew and heir, William James Conolly, in 1731. His family sold it in 1914. Various famous tenants of the Conollys in the castle included Archbishop Stone, the Protestant Primate (1750s), the Viceroy Lord Townshend (1770s), Lord Waterpark, and Baron de Robeck (who drowned at the Salmon Leap). In the 1920s it was the residence of the first French ambassador to the Irish Free State. In 1945 the castle was sold to William Kavanagh, prior to the purchase in 1958 by The Hon. Desmond Guinness. Castletown House & The Wonderful Barn Located off the main street of nearby Celbridge, Castletown House is the first grand Palladian House in Ireland ‚Äì the design of the building led to the construction of Leinster House and from thence to the White House in Washington, D.C. Begun in 1722 for Speaker William Conolly (1662‚Äì1729), Speaker of the Irish House of Commons, the lands and the house itself lie in Celbridge, however, there is also an entrance from Leixlip, hence there are two modern housing estates bearing the Castletown name, one in each town. To mark the eastern vista of Castletown a conical shaped building ‚Äì The Wonderful Barn ‚Äì was constructed in 1743 with the stairs ascending around the exterior of the building. St. Catherine's Priory St. Catherine's Priory was acquired by judge Nicholas White, and was an important monastery in the Middle Ages. Waterfall in Leixlip Spa Confey Castle British publisher and cartographer Samuel Lewis mentions Confey Castle in the first volume of his 1837 work A Topographical Dictionary of Ireland. In it, he comments that Confey's (or Confoy as he spells it) population was 165, had formerly had a town and a castle of some importance, which were noticed by Camden. Of the tower's remains were a massive five-storey structure with turrets at the north and west angles; that at the north angle containing a winding staircase opening through pointed arches into each storey. The principal entrance was under a semicircular archway. In the war of 1688 the castle is said to have been strongly garrisoned, and to have sustained an attack. Leixlip Spa Leixlip Spa was found in 1793 by workmen working on the construction of the Royal Canal, which runs through Leixlip. Salmon Leap Leixlip's main attraction in the past was the Salmon Leap, from which the town is named, a 5-metre waterfall on the Liffey just upstream from the then village. A hydroelectric dam was completed in 1945, and its lake flooded the waterfall. The dam generates 4 Megawatts. Religion Leixlip is divided into two Roman Catholic Church parishes, Leixlip (Our Lady's Nativity) and Confey (St. Charles Borromeo), each with its own parish church. The Church of Ireland parish of St Mary's also has a church in Leixlip, located in Main Street. This medieval church was restyled in the 1750s with Gothic windows, and its belltower clock dates from 1720. People from Our Lady's Nativity parish also have their own identity separate from people in the Confey parish. The Confey parish members are known as 'Hillers' and people from the Our Lady's Nativity parish are known as 'Farenders'. There is the usual local rivalry associated with two different parishes which is particularly evident during sporting events. Education and library As with religion and sports, education in Leixlip is divided by the two Catholic parishes of Leixlip (Our Lady's Nativity) and Confey (St. Charles Borromeo). The respective schools in the Confey district are Confey Community College (a community school), Scoil San Carlo (Junior), and San Carlo Senior School (both national schools). The community school of Confey College has approximately 750 pupils in total, and similarly to Col√°iste Chiar√°in is mixed gender and non-denominational. The name \\"San Carlo\\", while used as the Irish names of the national schools in the St Charles Borromeo parish, is actually the Italian rather than actual Irish translation (which would be \\"Naomh Cathal\\"). Leixlip also has one of the few Primary Montessori Schools in Ireland, Weston Primary Montessori School. Established in 2016 by the parents and teachers of the former Glebe School, this school provides Montessori education to children from 3‚Äì12 years and is located on the grounds of Barnhall Rugby Club. A public library opened in Leixlip in May 2006. It is situated in Confey beside the Town Council Office. It is also near both Scoil San Carlo and Confey Train Station. Leixlip Library hosts a variety of events and activities as well as free Internet access to library members. Shopping and local businesses  The town has four supermarkets ‚Äì a SuperValu, Eurospar, Aldi, and Lidl. As well as Eurospar, there are also three Spar convenience stores, Mace and a Tuthill's in Leixlip. The Liffey Valley Shopping Centre is a short drive down the N4, and Leixlip is also within reach of Dublin's shopping areas, including Blanchardstown Shopping Centre. In addition to local supermarkets and convenience stores, there are several other local businesses. This includes businesses in the professional services sectors, such as solicitors, architects and insurance firms. Festival The Leixlip Festival (previously known as the Salmon Festival) has taken place every year since 1990 on the June bank holiday weekend. It offers live entertainment in pubs, a number of open-air concerts, street carnival and fireworks display. Leixlip Salmon Festival Limited also provides a youth training scheme in association with Foras √Åiseanna Saothair. The festival has played host to bands such as The Coronas, Aslan in 2011, The Blizzards in 2017, The Hothouse Flowers, Republic of Loose, Delorentos in 2015 and The Riptide Movement in 2011, 2015 and 2019. Solo artists have also performed including Damien Dempsey and Niall Breslin. Industry Local Leixlip employers include Intel, who own a complex consisting of Fabs (fabrication plant) 10 & 14 (IFO), 24, and 24-2 of Intel's manufacturing operations. Hewlett Packard Enterprise was also a local employer, from 1995 until the closure of the facility in 2017. Most other employment in Leixlip is in retail businesses.

The species was first described by Thaddeus William Harris in 1841. It is found in North America from Nova Scotia west to Alberta, south to Colorado and California. Description The caterpillars grow to about 25 mm long. In color, they vary from light green to a dark brownish green. Light green caterpillars have white lines running down the body from the head to the tip of the abdomen while the darker caterpillars have a black stripe the length of their back. Larvae have three pairs of legs on their thorax and three pairs of prolegs on their abdomen. The first pair of prolegs is much smaller than the last two pairs. The pupa is wrapped in a silk cocoon and is buried just beneath the surface of the ground.\\"Fall Cankerworm\\". Insect Advice from Extension. Pennsylvania State University. Retrieved February 5, 2015. Adult males have a 25‚Äì35 mm wingspan. The forewings are glossy brown and crossed with irregular white bands. The females are brownish gray, wingless, and 10‚Äì12 mm long. Eggs are grayish brown with a dot and ring on the top and are less than 1 mm in diameter. Biology The larvae feed on a large variety of deciduous trees and shrubs, including Ulmus, Fraxinus and Acer. Other recorded hosts include hackberry, oak, various members of the rose family, walnut and willow. The larvae hatch and are active in the spring. These insects are called fall cankerworms because the females emerge from the soil in November, mate and lay their eggs in clusters on hardwood trees.\\"Fall Cankerworm (Alsophila pometaria)\\". NC Cooperative Extension Resources. Retrieved February 5, 2015 There are some natural enemies of this species. Many birds eat the caterpillars. The ground beetle, Calosoma frigidum also feeds on the caterpillars. The wasp, Telenomus alsophilae, parasitizes the eggs.

Background A (formal) language is simply a set of strings. Such sets can be specified by means of some language equation, which in turn is based on operations on languages. Language equations are mathematical statements that resemble numerical equations, but the variables assume values of formal languages rather than numbers. Among the most common operations on two languages A and B are the set union A ‚à™ B, and their concatenation A‚ãÖB. Finally, as an operation taking a single operand, the set A* denotes the Kleene star of the language A. Statement of Arden's rule Arden's rule states that the set A*‚ãÖB is the smallest language that is a solution for X in the linear equation X = A‚ãÖX ‚à™ B where X, A, B are sets of strings. Moreover, if the set A does not contain the empty word, then this solution is unique. Equivalently, the set B‚ãÖA* is the smallest language that is a solution for X in X = X‚ãÖA ‚à™ B.

Publication history  Hangman Comics was published by MLJ Magazines Inc., the precursor to what would become the publisher Archie Comics. The title started with issue #2 (Spring 1942), a 68-page comics following directly on from Special Comics #1, which also featured the same characters. The series was edited by Harry Shorten.Shorten was publisher of Tower Comics in the 1960s and also a comics writer, credited with creating MLJ/Archie characters Black Hood and ShieldHangman Comics, MLJ imprint, 1941 Series at the Grand Comics Database The feature character throughout the series was the titular Hangman, a masked superhero who first appeared in Pep Comics #17 (July 1941) and continued to appear there in his own feature during and after Hangman Comics' run. He appeared in three stories in each issue, each usually subtitled 'Special Case Number xx' ,although this was not always the case - Hangman Comics #3 (Summer 1942) contained 'Special Case' #7 and #9 with one untitled story in-between, while Hangman Comics #6 (Spring 1943) had two 'Special Case' #18s and there was a Hangman text story in most issues, something all comic books did through the early 1960s, to satisfy U.S. Postal Service requirements for magazine rates. The Hangman stories were drawn by a number of artists, including Paul Reinman, Bob Fujitami, Harry Lucey (who also drew the covers for issues #2-5) and Irv Novick. There were also two supporting stories in each issue starring \\"Boy Buddies\\", the Shield's partner 'Dusty the Boy Detective' and the Wizard's side-kick 'Roy the Superboy' in a dual adventure - the first regular costumed hero 'sidekick' team-up in comics.according to the \\"Boy Buddies\\" entry at \\"Don Markstein's Toonopedia\\" 'the Torch's Toro and Captain America's Bucky were both appearing regularly as members of The Young Allies months before The Shield's Dusty the Boy Detective and The Wizard's Roy the Super-Boy (no relation) started having adventures together as The Boy Buddies.' ; however, this was as part of a larger team. Most of the \\"Boy Buddies\\" stories were written by Bill Woolfolk, with art by either Paul Reinman or Bill Vogoda. Starting with issue #3 (Summer 1942), each issue also contained a \\"Boy Buddies Junior Flying Corps\\" club page, following on from a request for members in the final panel of the second \\"Boy Buddies\\" story in issue #2 (Spring 1942). Issue #6 (Spring 1943) replaced the Junior Flying Corps page with plans for a 'Silent Birdman' glider, while in the first 60-page issue, #7 (Summer 1943), the Junior Flying Corps page increased to two pages to accommodate plans for building a 'duplex glider' as well as the new members list, while the following issue, #8 (Fall 1943) had plans for building a 'Fleetwing' competition glider.

He was the first university teacher for neurotology to be appointed in Germany.  Life  Claussen studied medicine at the universities of Bonn and Hamburg, where he took his German medical state exam and the United States Medical Licensing Examination. In 1965, he obtained a doctorate degree with a dissertation, \\"a comparison of the enteral absorption of Digoxine and digostine esters\\". During his academic years, he attended courses at the universities of Toulouse (France), Oxford (England), Oslo (Norway), G√∂teborg (Sweden), Copenhagen and √Örhus (Denmark), as a scholarship holder of the Studienstiftung des deutschen Volkes. Between 1965 and 1967, Claussen was an intern at Hamburg and Simmerath (Eifel). From 1967 to 1970, he was assistant lecturer at the University ENT clinic of the University of Berlin. From 1968 to 1969, he completed research visits in the then newly created field of neurotology at Nils Gunnar Henriksson (1920‚Äì1999) in Lund (Sweden), and developed numerous neurotological tests such as cranio-corpography. In 1970, he qualified as a professor at the FU Berlin to be the first university teacher for neurotology (the study of the functioning and disordered functions of the cranial senses) in Germany. His postdoctoral thesis was about the recording and evaluation of selected quantitative equilibrium function tests (\\"√úber die Aufzeichnung und Auswertung ausgew√§hlter quantitativer Gleichgewichtsfunktionspr√ºfungen‚Äú). In 1969 he started developing corresponding departments at the university clinics of Berlin and W√ºrzburg. Since 1971, he has been head of this department in the ENT Clinic in the University of W√ºrzburg, where he qualified as a professor of neurotology in 1971. From 1972 to 1974, he conducted research in Buenos Aires (Argentina), under the tutorship of Juan Manuel Tato (1902‚Äì2004). He also published his first textbook, his own concept of modern equilibriometry, the objective and quantitative measuring of the equilibrium function. Additionally, he completed several research visits to the NASA laboratories headed by Ashton Graybiel in Pensacola, Florida. Claussen was professor and, since 1978, associate professor for neurotology at the ENT clinic of the University of W√ºrzburg until his Emeritus after the end of the summer semester 2004 . He investigated the regulation of the equilibrium, the sensory functions of the hearing organs, as well as smell and taste perception.  Work  Claussens Steel sculpture ‚ÄûCerebralo‚Äú in the Fine Art Park at Eisenb√ºhl Between 1967 and 1982, Claussen established a database including data about 30,000 neurotological patients in W√ºrzburg. Analysis of the data made it possible to draw conclusions about diseases such as vertigo and double vision, and hearing disorders or tinnitus. In 1972, Claussen began scientific cooperation with scientists and institutions around the world. In 1974, he co-founded the international Neurootological and Equilibriometric Society (NES) in Bad Kissingen and, in 1981, the \\"Research Society for Smell, Taste, Hearing and Equilibrium Disorders at Bad Kissingen‚Äú (4-GF e.V), of which he remains president. Also after his Emeritus, he still holds numerous honorary posts as a president or chairman of international medical organizations. Claussen has organized and conducted a lot of international congresses, which often take place in his home town of Bad Kissingen, about neurotology and disorders of the cranial senses as well as their therapy. So, he has, since 1974, organized the annual \\"International Congress of Neurootologists\\", which is attended by participants from 33 countries.

Expanded several times, last in 2009) and a museum hall. Since 1981, some of his steel large sculptures have been erected on public places in Switzerland, in Baden-W√ºrttemberg, Berlin and Franconia. One of Claussen's steel sculptures was erected in the Inner Court of the Charit√© in Berlin in 1991. His works of art have been exhibited in numerous single exhibitions since 1992. Claussen regularly gives lectures about \\"the connections between science and art with practical examples‚Äú (following invitations of the Art school der State University of New York in 1975 and of the University of W√ºrzburg in 1976). Since his formulation of the concept of Narrative Sensologism as bridging concept between science, art and philosophy in 2002, Claussen has given lectures concerning this topic. Claussen co-founded VAK (\\"Verein zur allgemeinen Kunstf√∂rderung\\", Association for General Art Promotion) in Lichtenberg (Upper Franconia) in 1987 and co-founded as a vice-president the European art association \\"Via Europae Sculpturarum‚Äú in 1997.

It is located in the southern part of the North York area, just across the border from Midtown Toronto. Its boundaries are Avenue Road to the east, Lawrence Avenue to the south, Bathurst Street to the West, and Wilson Avenue and Highway 401 to the north. The western boundary of Ledbury Park along Bathurst Street is a predominantly Jewish neighbourhood as many moved from downtown Toronto after World War II. History The area was settled by farmers in the 19th century. In 1918, most of the land was owned by real estate developers, who began to sell lots on the site. Lawyer-developer and President of Melrose Realty Company Herbert Abraham Clark (and Melrose co-founder Sir William Mulock) named a number of the new streets, such as Marmion, Deloraine, Melrose and Falkirk, after the works of Sir Walter Scott.Toronto Neighbourhoods Guide - Ledbury Park It was not until after the Second World War that most of the area was developed. The area was filled with small post-war bungalows and became a middle-class suburban area with easy access to Highway 401. The character of the neighbourhood began to change rapidly beginning in the 1990s. Ledbury Park is adjacent to Lawrence Park, one of Toronto's more upscale neighbourhoods. Ledbury Park began to be redeveloped in its image, as many of the 1950s bungalows were demolished and replaced with much larger based structures.\\"Ledbury Park just went upscale: Replacing bungalows with mini- mansions has changed the complexion of an old North York neighbourhood.\\" Desmond Brown. National Post. Sep 20, 2000. pg. A.23 Education Two public school boards operate primary education institutions in Ledbury Park, the separate Toronto Catholic District School Board (TCDSB), and the secular Toronto District School Board (TDSB). TCDSB operates St. Margaret Catholic School, whereas TDSB operates Ledbury Park Elementary and Middle School. Neither school board operates a secondary school in the neighbourhood, with TCDSB and TDSB secondary school students residing in Ledbury Park attending institutions in adjacent neighbourhoods. The French first language public secular school board, Conseil scolaire Viamonde, and it separate counterpart, Conseil scolaire catholique MonAvenir also offer schooling to applicable residents of Ledbury Park, although they do not operate a school in the neighbourhood. CSCM and CSV students attend schools situated in other neighbourhoods in Toronto. Recreation The Armour Heights branch of the Toronto Public Library is situated in Ledbury Park Several municipal parks are located in Ledbury Park including Bathurst-Wilson Parkette, Bedford Parkette, Brookdale Park, Grey Parkette, Ledbury Park, Old Orchard Park, and Woburn Park. Ledbury Park contains a skating rink in winter and a swimming pool in the summer. Municipal parks in the neighbourhood are managed by the Toronto Parks, Forestry and Recreation Division. The division also manages one community centre in the northeast of the neighbourhood, Armour Heights Community Centre. The Armour Heights branch of the Toronto Public Library is also situated in the neighbourhood, next to the community centre. Transportation The neighbourhood is bounded by several major roadways, Avenue Road to the east, Lawrence Avenue to the south, and Bathurst Street to the west. Portions of Highway 401, a controlled access highway, passes through the northwest portion of the neighbourhood. Public transportation is provided by several Toronto Transit Commission's bus routes.

The objective is to enable the study of astrobiology and to aid the planning of extraterrestrial exploration missions while prioritizing science, technology, and field campaigns. Overview ASTEP is one of four elements of NASA's Astrobiology Program, which falls under the Planetary Science Division of the Science Mission Directorate. According to the formal description from NASA, \\"The ASTEP program sponsors the development of technologies that enable remote searches for, and identification of, life in extreme environments, including planetary surfaces and subsurfaces.\\"(Marinova, 2010) http://www.astrobio.net/index.php?option=com_expedition&task;=detail&id;=3388&type;=blog&pid;=19 ASTEP is concerned with discovering technologies which will enable scientists to study astrobiology both on the surface of the Earth and on extraterrestrial bodies. A central focus of ASTEP's research is terrestrial field campaigns, or long-duration expeditions where researchers live in the same region they are studying. These are conducted on Earth in remote or hostile locations, such as Antarctica or the bottom of the ocean. Through understanding complex and exotic life on Earth, such as extremophiles, scientists hope to better define the characteristics they should look for and the locations they should seek when attempting to discover extraterrestrial life. Methodology ASTEP funded projects typically perform research by searching for and studying extremophile biology in Earth's harshest environments through the use of field research campaigns. The environments where this research is conducted is meant to simulate the expected conditions on extraterrestrial worlds in the Solar System. Past field work has typically targeted two regions. Arctic and Antarctic climates simulate the low temperatures expected on many other planets such as Mars, near rover landing sites. Underwater regions are also an area of study because they simulate high pressure, low light and variable temperature conditions. This region simulates proposed missions to explore the vast liquid water ocean that is expected to reside under Jupiter's moon, Europa.(German, 2009) http://www.astrobio.net/pressrelease/3287/oases-for- life-on-the-mid-caymen-rise ASTEP promotes the development of new exploration technologies and techniques that can search, identify, and study life in extreme conditions in locations that are difficult to access. There is a broad range of things that can fall into this category. Previous examples include laboratories such as the Mars Science Laboratory, sampling techniques, the Mars rovers, the Titan lander (Huygens), and submersibles.(Billings, Apout ASTEP, 2008) Autonomous systems are preferred because data can be collected without the presence of humans near the test area. The field campaigns are used as a proof-of-concept for the proposed technologies as well as a demonstration. They are generally tested with mock-mission where conditions and challenges simulate those that might be experienced on an actual mission. This helps identify their strengths and weaknesses in the technology's mission execution and structural endurance. Beyond the practice of new technologies, ASTEP strives to learn more about astrobiology through observation and study on the field campaigns. Analyzing the collected samples helps researchers determine the thermal, photonic, pressure, and chemical boundary conditions for living organisms. Understanding how these organisms adapt and evolve in these extreme conditions may be similar to the methods used by extraterrestrial organisms, and thus offers clues about where life may be found. Another area of study is the environmental footprint that extremophile life leaves behind, biomolecules or biosignatures such as chemical trails, geological formations, etc. Identifying these clues often inspires new biology searching techniques, and simplifies mission planning.

In recent years, ASTEP has been researching how these layered fossils could have formed by studying modern day microbial mats, which leave stromatolite similar to their ancestors.(Schirber, Astrobiology Magazine, 2010) http://www.astrobio.net/exclusive/3418/first- fossil-makers-in-hot-water ASTEP's instrument development program is currently working on a prototype to detect the presence of DNA on the Martian surface. The prototype will replicate any DNA found in Martian ice or regolith using polymerase chain reaction amplification techniques. The IceBite Project involves testing drills for future Martian missions where ice will need to be penetrated. The research is being conducted in high altitude Antarctic valleys which closely resemble the Phoenix landing site in geologic composition. As of 2009, the scientists have successfully completed the first phase of the three- year mission, which was to probe the region, install scientific instruments, and determine the future testing sites. A team of ASTEP scientists are exploring the Mid-Cayman Spreading Center, a wide ridge at the westernmost region of the Cayman Trough. Oceanic life reaches the extremes at the depths, where the pressure is the greatest and underwater sea vents pump hot and mineral-rich water into the ocean. Project researchers think extraterrestrial life could be similar to the exotic life forms found near these vents. The submersible Nereus was developed by ASTEP to autonomously survey the hydrothermal vent systems at the depths of the Mid-Cayman Spreading Center. Publicity In order to raise awareness about the research being conducted under the auspices of ASTEP, scientists have been increasingly using blogs as a way to convey information about their studies, typically when they are performing science at a remote location on a terrestrial field test. Scientists have also begun contacting museums via satellite uplink to discuss astrobiology with the public. The most prominent blog is produced by NASA's IceBite team, which performs annual expeditions to Antarctica.

JSTOR, jstor.org/stable/10.2307/saoa.crl.25318674. Accessed 13 Aug. 2020. Etymology and Origin of the title According to epigraphic records, it is an ancient title that goes back to the Sangam Era, given to junior members of the royal family. See inscription at Kannankara temple, Trivandrum District. Quoted as Inscription 9/60 in P. Sundaram Pillai's Some Early Sovereigns of Travancore. Page 40-41 He makes the observation that they were in his opinion not men in the royal service. Originally a title meaning \\"royal child\\", it came to be given to administrators of a king or a temple; often holding large estates on behalf of the latter.Mark de Lannoy,Kulasekhara Perumals of Travancore, Page 202 Early English records also address these hereditary ruling chiefs as the princes of Kerala ranking below the monarch. The most well known are the Pillais of the Eight Noble Houses, the Ettuveettil Pillamar of Travancore. Changing power of the Pillais Originally, they were royalty related to one another from amongst the swarupams of Travancore and in course of time some of these families became extinct or were superseded by the elite families of their large Nayar retainers.Mark de Lannoy,Kulasekhara Perumals of Travancore, Page 8 After the arrival of the refugee princes of Northern Malabar fleeing the invasion of Tippu Sultan, this practice was minimised and the refugee princes were raised to the status of Koyi Thampuran and granted estates belonging to these deposed Chiefs. Their absolute powers declined since the seizure of power and the creation of the state of Travancore under royal authority by King Marthanda Varma in the 1750s. The consolidation of Travancore was effected at the expense of the power of the ruling chiefs. Marthanda Varma also awarded the forfeited estates to new owners like in the case of Kilimanoor and also went on to create new titles to reward his friends and allies for military or political service rendered. The Pillais of Kerala had authority over their own regions and right of judgment in provincial disputes, as delegated by the king. They collected fines and taxes and in return received a share of the income they collected. In wartime they led the king's armies. Some desoms were grouped together under a Prince into larger units that represented earlier independent kingdoms. Many Pillais originally functioned essentially as royal governors. They would later do the same with other kings of whom they disapproved.Louise Ouwerkerk, See Introduction to her book No Elephants for the Maharaja in 1891, the Malayali Memorial, a memorandum signed by more than 10,000 people including Muslims and Christians,was submitted to the Maharaja Maharaja Sree Moolam Thirunal by the barrister, Parameswaran Pillai on behalf of the people of Kerala demanding administrative reforms primarily better representation of the former ruling castes of Kerala in the new administrative machinery of the state. In 1948, shortly after Indian Independence and Travancore's accession to the Indian Union, a people's government was formed by the State Congress party under Thanu Pillai, who had for over two decades agitated for responsible government. One of the first modifications they made to the erstwhile Government House and Secretariat was to install a statue of Velu Thampi in the forecourt. Ouwerkerk Papers op cit Pillais, land and titles Despite the changes in political power, a loose connection between Pillais and desoms remained for a long time after authority had moved over to the peishcars and proverticars. An official defining characteristic of a Pillai still consisted of the receipt of the revenues of justice of a desom, that later became a fixed sum. Many still held large estates that were absolute tax-free freeholds. Forms of address The Ruling Chiefs before the formation of the state of Travancore by Marthanda Varma are known by their family names and those elevated by Marthanda Varma or after use the title as a suffix to their given name. See page 5 op cit A Pillai (plural Pillamar) has the title Pillai of [X] when the title originates from a placename and Pillai is added as a suffix when the title comes from descent. In either case, he is referred to as Pillai [X]. Women can hold the latter title in their own right and her husband does not have a title (unless he has one in his own right). The nephews of a Pillai, are entitled to use a courtesy title, usually the highest of his uncle's lesser titles (if any). The heir to a Pillaidom, and indeed any level of aristocratic peerage, is styled Senior(Mootha) Pillai of [X], and successive nephews as Junior(Elaya) Pillai of [X]. Mark de Lannoy,Kulasekhara Perumals of Travancore Commoners were to address the ruling Chiefs as Thampuran and Kanakku Pillais with the suffix Achan \\"Pillai Achan\\" Achan (title) most distinguished title for kshatriyas the female equivalent was thampuratti Mark de Lannoy,Kulasekhara Perumals of Travancore, Page 204 Medieval chiefs of Kerala Ettuveetil Pillamar Some Madampis (Barons) and Naluvitans (Minor- Barons or Baronets) of South Travancore held the title of Pillai. They held their titles in perpetuity along with their family names rather than with their personal names. Their family names were derived from the areas they administered. According to Mark de Lannoy, at one time, prominent Pillais included six Nairs, a Brahmin (Pillai Idathara Potti) and a Kshatriya (Pillai Ilampel Pandarathil).Mark de Lannoy,Kulasekhara Perumals of Travancore, Page 6 at para2 . The most influential among them were Vanjamutta (identified with modern day- Vanjimuttom),Cuddamon (Kandamam), Barreba and Mandacca (Mondaicaud). The Queen of Attingal (Travancore) would take husbands from among these Lords. The Padmanabhapuram Palace was constructed by a king named Iravi Pillai Iravi Varma Kulasekhara Perumal in A.D. 1601.http://www.keralaculture.org/padmanabhapuram-palace/297. An Ettuveettil Pillai After Marthanda Varma's execution of 42 Chiefs, Barons and Nobles in 1730 Page 182 of Mark de Lannoy's \\"Kulasekhara Perumals of Travancore\\", University of Leiden in 1997 according to a noted expert, the title was demoted and came to be granted more commonly to decorate soldiers upon payment of the \\"Adiyara\\" from the time of Maharaja Anizham Tirunal Marthanda Varma who had previously subdued the power of the Pillais of the Eight Houses Ettuveettil Pillamar and annexed their territories.Sardar Kavalam Madhava Panikkar in Malabar & the Portuguese quoted in Aspects of Kerala Social Organisation, Asiatic Society 2014 This has resulted in the title being rather common rather than only among the highest echelons of Nair society in modern Kerala. The title of Pillai was then on granted to an individual for life upon payment of a fee known as \\"Adiyara\\" whose successors including women would be by courtesy titled Pillais. Inspire of this, to subdue the influence of these nobles, Marthanda Varma was to invent more new titles. Great Officers of State Besides these Chieftains, the Great Officers of the State Establishment until the latter half of the 19th century consisted of the Meleluttu Pillai (Accountant General), the Rayasam Pillai (Keeper of the Seal), several Rayasams and Kanakku Pillais respectively below them. These often hereditary offices of state were the highest positions below the Royal Household, being the Kaimal (Chancellor), the Kurup of Travancore (High Steward) and the Valia Sarvadhikaryakkar (Justice-General and Prime Minister).See Introduction- An Introduction to Kerala State Archives, Director of Archives, State Archives Department, Trivandrum 1975 Pandara Pillamar : Royal pages; they also formed the primary officers of the Maharajah's Bodyguard before 1730. The brigade existed till 1950 but consisted of European trained officers post 1730. They were collectively called Karya-kars or Tura- kars. Kanakku The title was bestowed through a formal ceremony known as Thirumukom Pidikkuka i.e. holding the face of the King and included the payment of a fee known as Adiyara to the King. A person thus bestowed with this title now secured the honorific title of Pillai suffixed and the distinctive title of Kanakku (meaning accountant in Malayalam) prefixed to his name. However Kanakku and Pillai were never used together. E.g.: either a person, Krishnan, would be referred to as Krishnan Pillai or Kanakku, followed by his maternal uncle's name, and Krishnan. The latter style was used in royal writs and communications. During the Travancore-Mysore War the forces of Mysore under Tipu Sultan were defeated by a sudden attack under the leadership of General Kali Kutty Nair who was posthumously elevated to the dignity of Pillaidom as Kali Kutty Pillai. They were collectively called Kanakku- Pillamar. Notable people * Raja Kesavadas (1745-1799), born Kesava Pillai, Dewan of TravancorePattom G.

Commissioned at Newport News on 16 November 1918, Lt. Comdr. Maurice E Huntley, USNRF, in command. Agwidale shifted to the Chesapeake and Ohio (C&O;) Piers at Norfolk on the 24th, and there took on board a cargo of motor tractors. On 4 December 1918 she sailed for the Virginia capes, and at 1300 that day sighted a disabled seaplane off her port bow. Agwidale altered course accordingly, and reached the downed Curtiss HS-2L flying boat soon thereafter, maneuvering to take the plane in tow. She apparently then headed back toward Hampton Roads, with the plane‚Äîstill occupied by its three-man crew‚Äî traveling in tow astern. Eventually, at 1512 the subchaser USS SC-195 came alongside and relieved the freighter of the towing chores to take the plane back to Hampton Roads. Two days later, having returned to an anchorage off the Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Co., Agwidale set out for France, and reached La Pallice, en route to Rochefort, on 19 December. After discharging cargo at Rochefort, Agwidale, in ballast, set out for the United States on 29 January 1919. Mooring at Hoboken, NJ on the afternoon of 15 February, the cargoman cleared New York Harbor 10 days later, bound for the Netherlands on her second and last voyage under the NOTS aegis. Agwidale reached Rotterdam via the British Isles on the afternoon of 12 March. She discharged her cargo over the ensuing days, and, on the morning of the 21st, let go all lines and got underway to return to the United States. She returned home without incident and tied up alongside Pier 15, Hoboken, shortly after noon on 4 April. Three days later, she received orders to prepare for decommissioning. At noon on 11 April 1919, Agwidale was decommissioned and turned over to representatives of the United States Shipping Board, a civilian crew replacing a token Navy one the following afternoon. Agwidale retained her name for the rest of her days under American registry, which extended through the depression years and World War II. Initially operated by the Clyde Steamship Co., she later worked under the flag of the Clyde Mallory Line, and, still later, Agwilines Incorporated, until she was sold to Chinese interests in 1946 and renamed Wei Ming. Her subsequent fate is a mystery.

The line ran from the Loop in downtown Chicago north to Wilson Avenue in Chicago's Uptown neighborhood with a branch to Ravenswood and Albany Park that left the main line at Clark Street. The Ravenswood line is now operated as the Brown Line, while the Main Line is used by the Purple and Red Lines. History=Beginnings The Northwestern Elevated Railroad Company was incorporated on October 30, 1893,Borzo, The Chicago \\"L\\", p. 61. and on January 8, 1894, it was granted a 50-year franchise by the City of Chicago. The original franchise stipulated that service between a downtown location to the south of the Chicago River and Wilson Avenue was to begin by December 31, 1897.Wilcox, Municipal Franchises, p. 479. This franchise was altered in 1895 to allow the line to connect to the new Union Loop,Wilcox, Municipal Franchises, p. 480. and the deadline for completion was later extended to May 31, 1899. Construction of the line started in February 1896, but the project experienced financial difficulties and work was paused later in the year and stopped completely in 1897.Borzo, The Chicago \\"L\\", p. 62. New financing was found, and construction began again in July 1899. In order to meet the franchise requirements, an inaugural train ran north from the Loop on December 31, 1899. However, on January 1, 1900, city officials declared that the railroad was unsafe and that the franchise had expired. Defiantly, the company ran another train the next day. Police stopped the train and arrested the crew, but company officials took the controls and managed to run the train into the Loop. In order to stop its return, police opened the Wells Street bridge and blocked the track with railroad ties, but the officials managed to evade the police by having the train switched on to the Lake Street Elevated Railroad. Eventually the company reached a new agreement with the city, and the first section of the railroad was officially opened on May 31, 1900. Expansion A preserved Northwestern Elevated Railroad car dating from 1907 On May 18, 1907, the Northwestern opened a branch to Ravenswood. The new branch left the main line just south of Clark Street and operated to Western Avenue. An at-grade extension to the branch's final terminal at opened December 14 1907 http://www.chicago-l.org/stations/kimball.html Service was extended north from the Wilson terminal to Central Street in suburban Evanston on May 16, 1908. This route was over the electrified trackage of the Milwaukee Road's Chicago and Evanston line. Initially the elevated tracks at Wilson were linked to the street level tracks of the Milwaukee Road by a wooden trestle incline. The Milwaukee Road depots at Argyle Park, Edgewater, North Edgewater, Rogers Park, Birchwood, Calvary, , , , and Central were demolished and the tracks spread to allow their replacement with new temporary island platform stations. New stations were also added at Hayes Street and Howard Avenue. The section of the line in southern Evanston between Howard Avenue and University Place was elevated onto an embankment by 1910, and the tracks between Lawrence and Howard were elevated between 1914 and 1922. A short extension from Central to Linden Avenue in Wilmette occurred on April 2, 1912. Consolidation In 1913, Chicago's four elevated railroad companies came together to form the Chicago Elevated Railways Collateral Trust, establishing crosstown services for the first time, and in 1924, all four companies were formally united to form the Chicago Rapid Transit Company. The Chicago Transit Authority took over the assets of the CRT in 1947.

Led by Lieutenant Edwin De Haven, the team explored the accessible areas along Franklin's proposed route. In coordination with British expeditions, they identified the remains of Franklin's Beechy Island winter camp, providing the first solid clues to Franklin's activities during the winter of 1845 before becoming icebound themselves.  Preparation  By 1850, three British rescue attempts had already failed to locate Franklin. In April and December 1849, Lady Jane Franklin sent appeals to American President Zachary Taylor that the search continue. When Congress lingered in passing the appropriations to purchase vessels, American merchant Henry Grinnell purchased two brigs, the 91-ton and 144-ton , refitted them for arctic service and offered them to the government, who quickly provided additional funds and volunteer Naval officers and crewSimmonds, p. 346. The expedition was instructed to focus on the areas of Wellington Channel and Cape Walker as conditions permitted. Elisha Kent Kane was brought in from field work in Florida to serve as surgeon aboard the Advance, and Captain Donald Manson was brought on as ice master aboard the Sophia. Preparation was managed quickly, and the expedition set out on May 22, 1850, from the Navy Yard at New York.  The voyage  Sighting Greenland on June 20, the expedition made harbor at the Crown Prince Islands (Whale Fish) in Disco Bay. From a British mail ship, they learned that British relief efforts were heading for the same region. Advance and Rescue left the islands on June 29,Simmonds, p. 347. encountering the ice field on July 1, while proceeding towards Upernavik. By July 7, the pack ice was dense enough to compel the Advance to tow the Rescue to prevent the vessels from becoming separated. The crews were periodically sent onto the ice to 'bore' a passage by hand, using crowbars, ice anchors and boathooks. For 21 days the ships were held nearly fast, only heaved slowly forward by efforts of the crew. Finally freed of the pack ice on July 28, the expedition sailed across Melville Bay, amid persistent ice bergs. As August began, food supplies were supplemented by hunting the returning auks and the occasional polar bear. On August 10, a wind change forced both ships to tie in and ride out dangerous pressure heaves as the ice closed in. After casting off to open water the next day, steady progress northward was made along the coast towards Lancaster Sound where they encountered Inuit hunters near Cape York, at nearly 76¬∞ north. Crews occasionally made short trips inland for hunting and observation.  Traces of Franklin  On August 18, the expedition made contact with British ship Lady Franklin under Captain William Penny, embarked on their own Franklin rescue mission. News of other concurrent British expeditions was exchanged. On the 21st, they encountered the Felix, under the command of Sir John Ross.Simmonds, p. 348. On the 22nd, they met with Captain Forsyth aboard the Prince Albert, who suggested a joint sledge search of the lower Boothian and Cockburne lands. Discovery of a cairn left two days earlier by Assistance and Intrepid at Cape Riley, Devon Island, indicated that traces of British encampments had been found at the cape, and also at Beechy Island. The Rescue under Captain Griffin, had shared in this discovery with Captain Ommanney. At Cape Riley, remnants of stone walls were found, presumably to support Franklin's tents. Remains of cases from salted meat as well as articles of clothing and boat fragments were found. No previous expeditions were known to have camped here. De Haven observed that the ice of Wellington Channel had every indication of having remained unbroken for several years previous. The joint team proceeded to Beechy Island on the 26th, meeting Captain Penny's ships Lady Franklin and Sophia. Penny was accompanied by R. Anstruther Goodsir, the brother of an assistant surgeon missing with Franklin's group. Other remains, including containers with London labels, newspapers from 1844, and papers signed by Franklin's officers, were tracked from the cape. By now, the expeditions of Ross and Penny were in the area of the Advance and Rescue. Coordinated search plans were being made when a land party at Beechy Island reported the discovery of graves. The three graves were marked by traditional wooden markers and protected by slabs of limestone, facing Cape Riley.  Icebound  Winter storms soon separated the ships, including Rescue, which was driven south out to sea. The Advance made for the relative shelter of Griffith's Island, to be joined by some of the others. The Rescue had regained control to the south, and De Haven, judging that the expedition had not reached a point from which the search could be resumed, decided to attempt a return of both ships home with the information gathered. The ice thickened, however, and the two ships were soon caught fast in Wellington's Straits at roughly 75¬∞24' north. De Haven named the mountains to the distant north \\"Grinnell Land.\\" The heavy ice nipped at the vessels and the floe dragged both ships northward as seasonal darkness began to set in. By October 1, the two ships were prepared for the long winter, with the upper decks covered, sails stacked and stove pipes set. An emergency depot of provisions was cached on the nearest shore. Periodically violent ice movements threatened both ships, which drifted north or south as dictated by the wind. Lard lamps kept the cabin temperatures just above freezing. Several crew members began showing early signs of scurvy, against which Kane hunted seals and foxes to provide fresh meat. Curious foxes were tamed to amuse the crew. Full winter preparations were completed by November 9, with the ships now in the vicinity of Beechy Island and temperatures generally below zero. As December began, the crew made preparations for abandoning the vessels in an emergency, preparing supplies and readying sledges. The ice continued to grind the brigs. On December 7, dangerous conditions forced the desertion of the Rescue, with her crew brought on board the Advance. The Advance was lifted by the ice, and crews were periodically sent out to pry the ice away from the bow, while the vacant Rescue was being slowly torn apart just away. The floe continued drifting, now to the southeast towards new ice hazards in Baffin Bay. Griffin led the practice of evacuation drills and snow was packed around the Advance as insulation from the increasing cold. Eight of the crew now displayed the blackened gums of scurvy as morale declined in the perpetual arctic night, despite an improvised Christmas theatrical. The year 1851 began at the edge of Baffin Bay, with temperatures generally around as daylight began its return. On January 13, the ice activity increased amid fierce winds, and supplies cached on the ice were lost while the situation of the Rescue became more dire. The tedium of February was broken by occasional games of football on the ice, and more theatricals at night. The symptoms of scurvy advanced, and rations of fresh food were increased, but to little avail. On the 22nd, the coldest temperature of the voyage was noted at . As March began, the decision was made to refit the Rescue for service, including hull repairs in a drydock carved from the surrounding ice. The increased daylight, exercise and liberal rations of sauerkraut and lime juice began to reduce the symptoms of scurvy among the crew. The movement of the ice packs slowed, until the ships were held around 72¬∞ north. At mid-March, the ice began to break up and wildlife began to return amid heavy snows. April brought some open water as the crew began salting the ice around the two brigs. On April 22, the crew of the Rescue completed their return to their ship, surprised that the brig had survived the winter after all.  Breakout  By mid-May, efforts to weaken the ice at the ships with long saws began to show results as the ice floe approached Cape Searle. Slabs of ice were cut from the mass surrounding the ships and winched away. Fresh meat from bird hunting and an occasional polar bear strengthened the crews. The open water crept closer to the ships, but remained tantalizingly out of reach. The break-up of the ice flow finally released the ships on June 5, 1851, after drifting some ; the stern of the Advance was still held aloft by a last large table of ice. Ice saws were used, but gunpowder for blasting could not be spared. These efforts were ineffective, as the ice also firmly held the rudder of the brig. This ice violently released the Advance on June 8, after which both ships made sail through a labyrinth of ice. They reached the Whale Fish Islands on June 16, and recuperated for five days with the Inuit at Godhavn before setting out north to resume their search for Franklin. By June 24, they encountered the pack ice again and slowly made their way towards Upernavik. Hunting and visiting with the local Inuit passed the time until they harbored at a Danish settlement in early July. Setting out as the ice cleared, they encountered British whalers, exchanging news, mail, and fresh provisions before briefly visiting Upernavik. Nearby, they again met and joined forces with the Prince Albert, still searching for Franklin. The three ships made slow progress northward though the ice fields over the next weeks, before the way was blocked entirely. On August 5, the Prince Albert abandoned the situation, heading south through the pressing ice. Rescue and Advance continued their efforts to reach the search areas of the open waters of Wellington Channel as the summer season faded early. They slowly cut north, yard by yard, through the increasingly violent pack ice, as larger icebergs drifted in and calved still more loose ice. By August 17, they had pulled themselves to open water for the first time in nearly a month, and De Haven resolved to return home before winter caught them again. Upernavik was reached on August 23\\\\. They were met by Henry Grinnell at New York on September 30, 1851, to whom both ships were returned.  Conclusions  In his official report, De Haven concluded that Franklin had probably made north for an unknown open sea following the winter near Beechy Island. Ultimately, it would be determined that the opposite was true, and that Franklin had continued south according to his original orders. De Haven, despondent over the premature conclusion of the expedition, regarded the voyage \\"with sad hearts that our labours had served to throw so little light upon the object of our search.\\" In 1853, Kane led the Second Grinnell expedition, failing to locate any new information regarding Franklin and ultimately abandoning the Advance to the ice.

Bendall‚Äôs early paintings emulate the ‚ÄòChardinesque‚Äô style of her tutor, but nonetheless, show her solid grounding in drawing, technique and composition, which later earned her the respect of Henri Matisse and Albert Marquet.FERMON, An Jo, \\"The Painting of Mildred Bendall: The Joy of Colour in Life and Nature\\" in Mildred Bendall: A Retrospective Exhibition, exhibition catalogue, Patridge Fine Art, London, 2008 In 1920, Bendall gained admission to the ‚ÄòSalon des Artistes Fran√ßais‚Äô in Paris, which eventually prompted her move to Paris during 1927‚Äì1928. It was her time at the ‚ÄòAcad√©mie de la Grande Chaumi√®re‚Äô in Montparnasse, where the painters of the ‚ÄòEcole de Paris‚Äô congregated, that transformed her style. Her friendship with Matisse in particular left a lasting influence on Bendall and her work. She adopted to great effect hi ‚ÄòFauve‚Äô ideas on colour as building blocks for form and space. Although Bendall never married, Jean-G√©rard Matisse, the son of the painter, did propose to her.POLDEN Sarah, Mildred Bendall, Whitford and Hughes, London, 1987 Career development Under Matisse‚Äôs guidance, Bendall became an active force of the avant-garde in Bordeaux, and built a real exchange between the provincial capital and Paris. In 1928, she helped to found the ‚ÄòArtistes Ind√©pendants bordelais‚Äô as a counter-movement against traditional Academism. Under her influence Bonnard, Braque, Utrillo, Matisse and Picasso all submitted paintings to its yearly exhibitions. In 1929, Bendall was also a founding member of ‚ÄòLe Studio‚Äô, a free and loosely grouped academy, and first to provide life-drawing classes in Bordeaux. In 1937, the Galerie de Paris, in Paris exhibited Bendall‚Äôs work in ‚ÄòJeune France‚Äô, alongside canvasses by Kees van Dongen, Max Jacob and Raoul Dufy. The Mus√©e National d'Art Moderne, Paris, purchased the work Bouquet a la table ronde. Late life Following the Second World War and until her death in 1977, Bendall, remained true to expressive colour and strong composition. Her unique blend of Fauvism and Expressionism articulates her individual visual enjoyment of Nature and its satisfying harmonies, in painting strong and tender, modern in technique yet attractive and sumptuous in appearance.

Since the 16th century, it was worn as a sign of their rank as archdukes of Austria in the procession prior to the Imperial coronation at Frankfurt am Main. Since the custodians of the archducal hat at Klosterneuburg Monastery refused to allow the archducal hat to be used by Joseph II for the procession preceding his coronation at Frankfurt am Main in 1764, a new archducal coronet had to be created. This new coronet didn't follow the pattern of the hat in Klosterneuburg. It consisted of a golden eastern coronet with pearls and precious stones. A flat velvet cap encircled by ermine was included. Having only one arch, it resembled the original archducal coronet introduced by Rudolph IV of Austria. At the center of the arch, it is surmounted by a globe and cross. After the coronation, the coronet became obsolete. The jewels and pearls were removed and were used for other purposes.

He also dominated the points classification. Sagan won the third stage of the Tour de France from an uphill sprint in Vittel. After the bunch sprint finish of stage four, in which Sagan placed second, he was disqualified after race officials judged that he caused Mark Cavendish to crash, with the jury president Philippe Marien saying that he \\"endangered some of his colleagues seriously\\". Before the crash, Cavendish tried to squeeze through a space that he saw was closing. Opinions have been largely negative on whether Sagan should be disqualified from the race. The opinion of many commentators and former riders was that a disqualification is not justified and even senseless. Months after the Tour, Sagan was officially exonerated by the UCI. Cavendish withdrew from the race later that day due to his injuries. Following his disqualification from the Tour, the World Champion turned his focus to the 2017 Tour de Pologne, where he won Stage 1. He also stated he would skip the 2017 Vuelta a Espa√±a, opting to train for an unprecedented third consecutive victory at the 2017 UCI Road World Championships in Norway. monument at the 2018 Paris‚ÄìRoubaix (pictured leading the winning beakaway at 8 km from the finish in Willems). On 8 September, Sagan sprinted to his 100th career victory at 2017 Grand Prix Cycliste de Qu√©bec. On 24 September, Sagan won the World Championship for the third consecutive year at the World Road Race Championships in Bergen, Norway. He began the final climb in 80th position and finished in a bunch sprint ahead of Norway's Alexander Kristoff and Australia's Michael Matthews.  2018  Sagan kicked off the 2018 season by winning the People's Choice Classic, the prelude criterium to the Tour Down Under. Two days later, he took third place in the first stage of the 2018 Tour Down Under in a bunch sprint to Andre Greipel and Caleb Ewan. On Stage 4, Sagan maintained the pace of the lead group up Norton Summit, and was able to take his first World Tour win of the season following a descent to the finish. He skipped the Belgian season openers to prepare at altitude camp in the Sierra Nevada before starting his European campaign in Italy. He finished eighth in Strade Bianche, 43rd overall in Tirreno‚ÄìAdriatico, and sixth in Milan‚ÄìSan Remo. Sagan wearing the Green Jersey at the 2018 Tour de France Moving on to the cobbled classics, he was 26th in E3 Harelbeke before winning his third and record-equalizing Gent‚ÄìWevelgem. One week later he finished sixth in the Tour of Flanders. On 8 April, Sagan won Paris‚ÄìRoubaix with an attack at 55 km from the finish to join an earlier break. Only Silvan Dillier could keep up and Sagan beat the Swiss in a two-up sprint on the Roubaix Velodrome. He closed his classics campaign with fourth place in the Amstel Gold Race. In the Tour de France, Sagan finished 2nd Stage 1 behind Fernando Gaviria. In Stage 2, Sagan won the stage and earned the green jersey and wore it for the rest of the tour. Sagan won Stage 5 and Stage 13. He crashed on a descent during stage 17, but finished and won the points classification.  2019  Sagan's first victory of the season came on the third stage of the Tour Down Under. His spring campaign was punctuated with a notable 5th place at Paris-Roubaix and he had to wait until the Tour of California to be victorious again. Sagan won stage 5 in Tour de France while finishing 5th and 4th in stage 3 and stage 4. He won the points classification becoming the first rider to win it seven times. The record was previously held by German Erik Zabel. 2020 In 2020, Sagan started his season at the Vuelta a San Juan in Argentina. He finished second on the seventh and last stage, his best result of the event. He then went on to race Paris‚ÄìNice instead of Tirreno‚ÄìAdriatico when the latter race was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy. The spring classics were also cancelled or postponed. On 26 June he confirmed his first participation at the Giro d'Italia.  Personal life  Sagan was married to Katar√≠na Smolkov√°. They married on 11 November 2015 in Slovakia and resided in Monaco. Their first child, Marlon, was born on 25 October 2017. On 18 July 2018 Peter Sagan announced their separation. Sagan is a practising Catholic and met Pope Francis in Vatican City in January 2018.

The museum in Cave Creek, Arizona contains art, antiques, and other items of historical interest from the past two centuries. She has lived through about half of the history that's detailed in the Grace Museum of America. Frederick honed her acting while she was a young vaudeville and Broadway actress. Her talents were useful in many ways during the tours she gave at the Grace Museum. As well as guiding tours, she also provided the voices for mannequins on display during the tours.  Background  Born in 1905 in Yonkers, moved to Brooklyn, her father was a printer; she studied theater, fencing, and Shakespeare in theatrical school, then worked in vaudeville and on Broadway until 1931. She had interests in photography, many travels, finally finding home in Arizona in 1970.  Awards  In 1994, Frederick received the YWCA award as a philanthropist and is a member of the YWCA Tribute to Women Alumnae. 2008, The National Society of the Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR) awarded Frederick the DAR Medal of Honor during the DAR National convention in May of that year (Sonoran News, 2008). The award is presented to those showing exemplary leadership, trustworthiness, service and patriotism.  Television  During the tour, a picture of a youthful Frederickson can be seen in a display in which the article informs of her television dialogs and pantomimes. Grace Voss was in fact one of the first women to act on television and Frederson has stated that the experimental media of the time seemed more like a hobby than anything groundbreaking. Her television acts consisted of monologues and pantomimes; performed through 1931.  Claude Frederick  Grace Voss finished acting and began working with photography. She met Claude and for a time they created backgrounds for television sets. Later, the two traveled much of the world finally settling comfortably in Arizona. Claude died in 1981 and Grace soon began work on the Grace Museum of America which showcases 200 years of history. Frederick was proud that the museum was able to show the \\"development and progress in all kinds of ways\\". Claude, along with the help of Grace, invented the \\"Apparatus for projecting multiple superposed images\\"; which they called it a ‚ÄúThree- Plex‚Äù tushar.Apparatus for projecting multiple superposed images United States Patent 3036496.  Modern advances and nature Technological advancements amazed Frederick, but she enjoyed nature as well (Coomes, 2005). Her home, in which she lived for almost 35 years, was high in the Sonoran Desert. Although her home was near the museum, the location was full of many types of nature and wildlife. Most of the surrounding areas were undeveloped and the most common residents are deer and peccary also known as javelina. Grace would regularly enjoy the animals with the company of her friend and neighbor, Eileen Kettner. More than a dozen deer frequent the yard outside Frederick's home and are regularly accompanied by javelina during \\"feeding time\\". Frederick had stated that she has seen a mountain lion on occasion, as well.  Donations  In 2001, Frederick gave of her land to the Arizona State University Foundation. She also donated $6 million to create a center for cultural improvement. Frederick considered the land her \\"heavenly view of nature\\" and the donation ensured that the land would stay preserved in its natural state.

It was constructed between 1872 and 1874 by John Gibson. It is now a hotel and health spa. History In the 13th century, Reigate Priory was founded on this site by William de Warenne, 5th Earl of Surrey. The land was taken by the Crown during the Dissolution of the Monasteries, but was subsequently given to William Howard, 1st Baron Howard of Effingham, uncle of Henry VIII's fifth wife Catherine Howard. In 1681, the estate was sold to the brewer John Parsons. It was divided into lots for sale in 1766; what became Nutfield Priory is a site bought by John Fowler. The estate was inherited by John Fowler Wood and sold to H E Gurney, a Quaker, in 1854. In 1866, Gurney's firm Overend Gurney declared bankruptcy, owing ¬£19 million. The estate was sold to the brewer James Watney, who in turn sold it to the member of parliament Joshua Fielden in 1869. Fielden commissioned Gibson to design and build the present building, and held regular music recitals and events during his time there. He adhered to a rigid lifestyle, with guests not speaking to each other and following a predefined routine. Following Fielden's death in 1887, ownership of the priory passed to his wife Ellen. She sold the house in 1920, where it remained a private residence before being sold again to O Picton Davis in 1930, who converted it into a luxury hotel with a nine hole golf course. The priory was commandeered by the British Army during World War II. It was subsequently used as a school for the deaf, installing closed circuit television to aid with teaching. It was renovated as a hotel in 1989, restoring much of the original architecture. It was Grade II listed in 2011. Architecture View of the priory's neo-Gothic design Gibson designed the house in a neo-Gothic manner in the style of the Palace of Westminster. The priory is built from Kentish ragstone rubble and dressed with Reigate stone. It is composed of two storeys and an attic, with a tiled roof. A six-storey tower hangs over the main entrance on the north side, while there is a three- storey projection to the west.

It is the first Warwick bass with the single cut design. History Following the increasing popularity of the \\"Single Cut\\" bass design, Warwick decided to keep up with the other companies and build their own single cut bass. This idea was initially started within the Warwick Official Forum, with one user making a SC Thumb mockup that looked promising for the rest of the members. This gave the idea to Florin Barbu, the forum host, to contact Hans-Peter Wilfer, to see if there was a way for this initial idea to be realized. Peter Wilfer gave him the idea to organize a forum contest, in which users would create a \\"Warwick- like\\" SC bass using modern Warwick specifications. In a tournament-like fashion, the contest began on January 2008. On 7 July 2009, Florin announced that the users Zsolt Ferenczi and Laszlo Demeter were the winning team. The winning model became a real bass in the Warwick line-up. The Thumb SC was officially presented on NAMM 2010. Concept The Thumb SC's shape is based on the original design of the Thumb NT. The woods it is constructed out of, however, make it different from the Thumb NT. The Thumb SC is constructed with a US Swamp Ash body and a Bubinga Pommel√© top, a Tigerstripe Ebony fingerboard, and a Flame Maple neck. Hardware/pickups & Electronics The Thumb SC uses the black standard Warwick hardware. Like the Thumb NT 6-string, the Thumb SC has two active MEC humbuckers nestled near the bridge, and a 3-band active EQ. However, the Thumb SC has two mini toggle switches for coil splitting, where the Thumb NT does not.

In other words, model validation is the task of confirming that the outputs of a statistical model have enough fidelity to the outputs of the data-generating process that the objectives of the investigation can be achieved. Overview Model validation can be based on two types of data: data that was used in the construction of the model and data that was not used in the construction. Validation based on the first type usually involves analyzing the goodness of fit of the model or analyzing whether the residuals seem to be random (i.e. residual diagnostics). Validation based on the second type usually involves analyzing whether the model's predictive performance deteriorates non-negligibly when applied to pertinent new data. Figure 1. Data (black dots), which was generated via the straight line and some added noise, is perfectly fitted by a curvy polynomial. Validation based on only the first type (data that was used in the construction of the model) is often inadequate. An extreme example is illustrated in Figure 1\\\\. The figure displays data (black dots) that was generated via a straight line + noise. The figure also displays a curvy line, which is a polynomial chosen to fit the data perfectly. The residuals for the curvy line are all zero. Hence validation based on only the first type of data would conclude that the curvy line was a good model. Yet the curvy line is obviously a poor model: interpolation, especially between ‚àí5 and ‚àí4, would tend to be highly misleading; moreover, any substantial extrapolation would be bad. Thus, validation is usually not based on only considering data that was used in the construction of the model; rather, validation usually also employs data that was not used in the construction. In other words, validation usually includes testing some of the model's predictions. A model can be validated only relative to some application area.. A model that is valid for one application might be invalid for some other applications. As an example, consider the curvy line in Figure 1: if the application only used inputs from the interval [0, 2], then the curvy line might well be an acceptable model. Methods for validating When doing a validation, there are three notable causes of potential difficulty, according to the Encyclopedia of Statistical Sciences.. The three causes are these: lack of data; lack of control of the input variables; uncertainty about the underlying probability distributions and correlations. The usual methods for dealing with difficulties in validation include the following: checking the assumptions made in constructing the model; examining the available data and related model outputs; applying expert judgment. Note that expert judgment commonly requires expertise in the application area.. Expert judgment can sometimes be used to assess the validity of a prediction without obtaining real data: e.g. for the curvy line in Figure 1, an expert might well be able to assess that a substantial extrapolation will be invalid. Additionally, expert judgment can be used in Turing-type tests, where experts are presented with both real data and related model outputs and then asked to distinguish between the two.. For some classes of statistical models, specialized methods of performing validation are available. As an example, if the statistical model was obtained via a regression, then specialized analyses for regression model validation exist and are generally employed. Residual diagnostics Residual diagnostics comprise analyses of the residuals to determine whether the residuals seem to be effectively random. Such analyses typically requires estimates of the probability distributions for the residuals. Estimates of the residuals' distributions can often be obtained by repeatedly running the model, i.e. by using repeated stochastic simulations (employing a pseudorandom number generator for random variables in the model). If the statistical model was obtained via a regression, then regression-residual diagnostics exist and may be used; such diagnostics have been well studied.

He composed, conducted, arranged and orchestrated more than 850 separate credits in television, as well as the music for more than 100 films. His credits in television included Lassie, The Twilight Zone and Dragnet, while his film credits included the film score for Wake of the Red Witch. Biography=Early life Scott was born in Salinas, California. He received a bachelor's degree in music from the University of California, Berkeley in 1939. He began working in radio broadcasting after graduation. Career Scott was named the West Coast music director for Blue Network, which was owned by NBC, in 1942. However, he was soon drafted into the United States Army during World War II, where wrote music and played the trombone for the Air Transport Command Band, based in Long Beach, California. He later conducted shows on the Armed Forces Radio Service such as Command Performance. Following the end of World War II, Scott was hired by Republic Pictures as a staff composer for six years, beginning in 1946. He composed, conducted or orchestrated \\"dozens\\" of film scores for Republic Pictures, including Heart of the Rockies and Wake of the Red Witch, starring John Wayne. Though much of his career would focus on scoring for television, his later film credits at other film studios included MGM's 1961 X-15 and Montana Belle, which was released by RKO Pictures in 1953. Scott left Republic Pictures in 1952. Beginning in the early 1950s, Scott spent most of his career composing for television. Starting in 1952, Scott orchestrated and arranged music for Dragnet's original composer, Walter Schumann. Scott did the arrangements for all Dragnet episodes, until the show's series finale in 1959. Scott also composed the score for approximately six Dragnet episodes. Scott wrote the theme music for the 1964 dramatic series, Slattery's People, which aired during the 1964-1965 television season. He also worked on the Twilight Zone for two episodes, scoring the music for A Stop at Willoughby in 1960. In 1963, Scott began working on the classic television series, Lassie. He scored virtually all the episodes of Lassie (except for 4) until the show ended its run in 1974. His 1950s and 1960s television credits included episodes of My Three Sons, Steve Canyon, The Untouchables, Rawhide and Wagon Train. Scott orchestrated for a number of other prominent television and film composers beginning in the 1970s, including Quincy Jones on The Color Purple, his son Tom Scott in Hanky Panky and Stu Phillips for The Fall Guy and Battlestar Galactica. Nathan Scott died of natural causes at his home in Sherman Oaks, California, on February 27, 2010, at the age of 94. He was survived by his son, Grammy-winning saxophonist Tom Scott; his second wife, Frances McCune Scott; his daughter, Linda Colley; his brother and two grandchildren. His first wife, Margery, died in 1995.

He was appointed to that position on 1 March 2015, replacing John Chrysostom Muyingo; in the reshuffle of June 2016, however, he was not reappointed. As a cabinet minister, he was also an ex officio member of parliament. Before his ministerial appointment, he was a deputy vice chancellor at Makerere University, the oldest and largest of the eight public universities in Uganda. Background and education Tickodri-Togboa was born in Oduluba Village, approximately , east of downtown Arua, the largest town in the West Nile sub- region. His mother died when he was three years old. His father, a construction worker, remarried after Togboa's mother died. Tickodri-Togboa attended Arua Junior School for his middle school studies He attended Nyakasura School before joining Nairobi University, where he studied electrical engineering. Later, he obtained a Master of Science from Makerere University and a doctorate from the University of Odessa in Ukraine. Research activities and accomplishments=Academic records management systems The Academic Records Management Systems (ARMS) Project aims at the development of a comprehensive user-centric ARMS to support Makerere University's logical and physical academic infrastructure, using state-of-the- art technologies and current generation industrial aesthetics. A home-born- and-grown project, it incorporates the provision of relevant learning experiences for students in the Faculty of Technology offers experiential learning (Equal Opportunities for Girl and Boy Child) and adds Value to the pedagogical experience. The ARMS project team is composed of thirteen undergraduate students (five females and eight males), and one junior member of staff. The System is currently being piloted in the Faculty of Technology and will eliminate the current challenges of inaccurate and delayed transcripts. Electronic academic-events scheduling system The Electronic Academic-Events Scheduling System (eAESS) Project is aimed at the development of an eAESS - state-of-the-art, needs-responsive, scheduling system using the Faculty of Technology as the development and test site. The eAESS is envisaged to go a long way in addressing the current challenges in scheduling and to build a robust timetabling system. The system will consist of three major sub- systems, namely; the Online Scheduling System, the Information Display System and the Uninterrupted Power Sub-System. The Online Scheduling System will enable lecturers to book time-slots and be allocated rooms subject to class size and other necessary academic resources. The Information Display System will be used to flaunt compiled schedules, notices and other communications from the administration. The Uninterrupted Power Sub-System will ensure round- the-clock availability. The Project Team includes three undergraduate students (two males and one female) and one junior member of staff. iLABS This project is being undertaken in collaboration with Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the United States, with the goal of developing on-line laboratories (iLABS) to supplement conventional laboratories to meet challenges of scarce financial resources and large student populations. The project engages undergraduate and graduate students and staff members in research geared towards development of online experiments. iLabs offer a flexible and convenient experimentation platform to an unlimited number of users; thus, alleviating space and scheduling problems associated with increasing student numbers. The current core development team is composed of eighteen undergraduate students (nine male and nine female), two undergraduate students, and three junior staff members. The project has so far developed over twelve iLabs and, working closely with the Electrical Engineering Department, these labs have been integrated into the B.Sc.Electrical Engineering and B.Sc.Telecommunication Engineering Programs to provide experimentation experience to students. Soon these will be incorporated in the B.Sc.Computer Engineering Program.

Early life Su Xuelin was born to a family of officials native to Anhui province in 1897. Her grandfather, Su Jinxin, served as a magistrate in several counties in Zhejiang province, where Su Xuelin was born. Her mother was surnamed Tu, but had no formal first name, instead going by the nickname To-Ni. Su's father held a minor official position, first under the Qing dynasty and then the Republic of China. Su had three brothers and two sisters. Education and career She studied in Anhui, and later Beijing under the supervision of Hu Shih. During the May Fourth Movement, she penned an essay Green Skies and a novel Thorny Heart which won critical acclaim. In 1922 she went to France and returned to China in 1925. Then she taught in Soochow University and Wuhan University. She was an opponent of Lu Xun, a contemporary Chinese writer, and wrote to Cai Yuanpei to dissuade him from serving as the chairman of the committee to prepare Lu's funeral after Lu died in 1936. This provoked anger from the leftists in China who vociferously castigated Su. In 1949, when the Chinese Communist Party overthrew the republic, she moved to Hong Kong, where she was offered a position as an editor and translator by the Catholic Church in Hong Kong. However, Su was not able to find materials for her research in Hong Kong, so she left for Europe a year later, still supported by the Catholic Church. After visiting Vatican City, she went to France. While there, she took courses at the Coll√®ge de France, where she was influenced by √âdouard Paul Dhorme, Paul Demi√©ville, and Georges Dum√©zil. However, Su found that French sinology was irrelevant to her scholarship, and left France after only two years. Around the period she shifted her research concentration on ancient texts, such as those written by Qu Yuan and of Greek and Roman mythology. From 1952 she taught in Taiwan, at National Taiwan Normal University and National Cheng Kung University. She retired in 1973 and was awarded the first title of Honorary Professor at Cheng Kung University.A Study of Professor Su Xue-lin Personal life Su converted to Roman Catholicism in 1924. In her autobiography Fu Sheng Jiu SI, Su stated that she was a descendant of Su Zhe, a renowned poet of the Song Dynasty.

They live between 20¬∞ S and 50¬∞ S, at altitudes between . Description Aeglids resemble squat lobsters in that the abdomen is partly tucked under the thorax. The notable sexual dimorphism in the abdomen is related to the behaviour of carrying fertilised eggs on the pleopods. The carapace length of the largest species may approach , but most are considerably smaller. Aeglids are omnivorous, preferring plant matter, but also eating adult insects, molluscs, fish and fly larvae. The internal anatomy has been described for Aegla cholchol and generally resembles that of other anomurans, particularly galatheoid squat lobsters. The morphology of the antennal gland bladder differs from that in other anomurans in having a twisted tubular structure which was interpreted as an adaption to the freshwater lifestyle. Life cycle Mating is preceded by a period of courtship, and does not coincide with moulting, as it does in many other decapods. The eggs of aeglids hatch as juveniles which closely resemble the adults. They are cared for by their parents and live at the bottom of the body of water. Extant taxa Aegla, the only extant genus in the family, contains around 74 described extant species. Of the 63 species and subspecies described by 2008, two are found in lakes, four in caves, and the remaining 57 are found mainly in rivers. 42 species are found in Brazil, all restricted to the country's southern and southeastern regions (Rio Grande do Sul alone is home to 24).

Hitler refused and when he was threatened by Sherrill with an American boycott, promised purely German Olympic Games. Sherrill sent the information to the IOC president, Henri de Baillet-Latour, who did not insist on Jewish participation on the German teams.

The area has two Roman Catholic schools (one being the nearby Our Lady's High School), a non-denominational school, a community centre, several small shopping area, two takeaway shops and a pub. Muirhouse is surrounded by countryside and has many walking routes into Motherwell Town Centre. The nearest train station is Sheildmuir, located on the outskirts of the suburb. Regeneration and Upgrades The area has seen regeneration with the destruction of several low rise flats and replaced with housing and green areas . The tower blocks have seen substantial upgrades over the years. Most obviously, new overcladding was applied to the exteriors between 1997 and 2000 (with the first blocks to be upgraded being Grange and Merryton and the last being Shields and Muirhouse). Other work included the enclosing of external balconies and the installation of CCTV inside and outside the blocks. North Lanarkshire Council has also been upgrading the interior of the flats by replacing dated bathrooms and kitchens. Currently the council are testing the cladding on the side of each tower to check flammability. The local fire service are currently inspecting the towers' safety. In 2017, it was reported that the council planned to demolish all the towers in its control over the next 20 years and replace them with modern housing, due to the rising costs of maintenance as the buildings aged, as well as some of the flats being unpopular and underoccupied (although this was not a major issue in Muirhouse).Plans to demolish every North Lanarkshire tower block over next 20 years, Scottish Construction Now, 20 December 2017All council high-rise flats in North Lanarkshire 'could come down', BBC News, 20 December 2017Towers among the first to be demolished, Motherwell Times, 30 March 2018Building You a Better Future - Regeneration Proposals for your area, North Lanarkshire Council, 9 April 2019  Tower block names  References: * Barons Tower * Dalziel Tower * Glassford Tower * Grange Tower * Merryton Tower * Muirhouse Tower * Netherwood Tower * Shields Tower * Glen Tower * Woodside Tower * Lodge Tower * Burnside Tower * Doonside Tower References External links  *Muirhouse Primary School *St Brendan's Primary School *Isa Money Community Centre * https://www.facebook.com/pages/Muirhouse-in- Motherwell/1391066651153661 Facebook page for former and present residents Category:Motherwell Category:Housing estates in Scotland Category:Neighbourhoods in North Lanarkshire ","title":"Muirhouse, Motherwell"},{"id":"26502324","title":"Seeland (administrative district)"},{"id":"26502354","text":"Newworldson is the self-titled second album from Canadian Christian soul band Newworldson.

History Construction of the plant received a go-ahead in 1968, with a formal announcement of the project coming a year later. Douai was chosen because it was well located at the heart of the industrial centre of gravity of the EEC with excellent road links to major industry and population centres. It was also in an area with a large pool of available workers, due to the running down of coal mining in the area. The first car put into serial production at the plant was the Renault 5, initially in small batches, starting early in 1975. The principal production location for the little car was, and remained, at Flins, however. Towards the end of 1975 production started at Douai, in much larger batches, of the Renault 14, building up stock ahead of the launch of Renault's first head-on Golf competitor in 1976. Volumes in 1976 were 325 Renault 14 and 50 R5's per diem. The plant has continued to specialise in the manufacture of cars in the small family car segment. By 1977 the plant was employing 7,000 people. This was a period of rapid automation in car production, and as a new plant Douai was more highly automated than most. It was perhaps a reflection of the fact that all the jobs at the plant were then new jobs, that the robots were viewed with some affection by some members of the workforce. At the end of the body assembly shop much of the main welding together of the pressed panels was undertaken by a team of four \\"Unimate\\" robots christened, by their human colleagues, Theophile, Arsine, Marcel and Modeste. Visitors at this time were also impressed by the ample space in the plant available for further expansion. However, in 2008 Douai suffered a blow when production of mainstream Renault M√©gane model was concentrated on the Palencia plant: hitherto the two plants had assembled the model in parallel, but sales volumes no longer justified that arrangement. Douai retained the sporty low volume M√©gane CC Coup√© and Cabriolet. Production=Historical production The following Renault models have been manufactured at Douai: * Renault 5 * Renault 14 * Renault 9/Renault 11 * Renault Fuego * Renault 21 * Renault 19 * Renault M√©gane I * Renault Sc√©nic I (4X2 and RX4) * Renault M√©gane II (saloon and coup√©) * Renault Sc√©nic II * Renault Grand Sc√©nic * Renault Sc√©nic III * Renault Grand Sc√©nic III Current production Of these, the following were still manufactured there in 2020 * Renault Espace V * Renault Talisman saloon/estate * Renault Scenic 4/Scenic 4 Long.

History Previously known as Leabhar U√≠ Dubhag√°in, after Se√°n M√≥r √ì Dubhag√°in, d.1372 of the prominent family of historians and musicians in East Galway, it was later also known as the Book of the O'Kelly's, written at the behest of Muircertach √ì Ceallaigh (d. 1407), Bishop of Clonfert (1378‚Äì93) and then Archbishop of Tuam (1393‚Äì1407). The book was written by ten scribes in U√≠ Maine before 1392 and sometime after 1394. There were ten scribes, eight of whom are anonymous. The principal scribe and overall compiler of the manuscript was √Ådhamh C√∫is√≠n (fl. c.1400); the only other scribe known by name is Faol√°n Mac an Ghabhann na Sc√©al (d. 1423). It is a massive, oversized vellum book written in Irish. It was property of the O'Kelly clan until 1757, when it was sold to William Betham In 1814, Betham proceeded to sell the manuscript to the Richard Temple-Nugent-Brydges-Chandos-Grenville, 1st Duke of Buckingham and Chandos. The Duke then donated the manuscript to the Royal Irish Academy in 1883, where it is currently housed. Contents The manuscript is a massive, oversized vellum book written in Irish, its contents are described by one of the scribes as bolg an tsolathair (a mixed bag of contents). It includes a series of metrical dindsenchas, An Banshenchas, Cormac's Glossary, Lebor na Cert, portions of Lebor Gab√°la, poems, genealogies and pedigrees. The largest single section is devoted to the origins and genealogies of the √ì Ceallaigh dynasty of U√≠ Maine, its contents updated to the time of compilation. Works found in this work are quatrains paying tribute to the long reign and continuing prosperity of the U√≠ Dhiarmada (i.e., the descendants of Diarmuid Mac an Bh√°ird), praising the Mac an Bhairds in their capacity as Chiefs of Cin√©l Rechta Soghain of east-central County Galway. Lost material Some forty folios have become detached and lost. One fragment is preserved as folios 17‚Äì19 of London, British Library, MS Egerton 90. Dubhaltach MacFhirbhisigh drew upon some of the missing material while writing Leabhar na nGenealach at Galway in 1649‚Äì1650. Texts he utilised included Seanchas S√≠l √çr, and perhaps Clann Ollamhan Uaisle Eamhna. Material was also incorporated into Cuimre na nGenealach, written in early to mid-1666. MacFhirbhisgh's transcriptions are noted by Nollaig √ì Mura√≠le as being very faithful compared to surviving portions. A catalogue was made of the manuscript's contents in the seventeenth century, while it was in the possession of Sir James Ware and before the subsequent loss of certain folios. This reveals it also to have included, at that time, texts like Lebor Gab√°la √ârenn and Acallam na Sen√≥rach.

Trafficking in Persons Report 2008. U.S. Department of State (June 4, 2008). This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. In its 2018 and 2019 Trafficking in Persons Report, the United States Department of State's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons noted that Ireland had been downgraded from a tier 1 to a tier 2 country, meaning it was no longer meeting \\"the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking but [..] making significant efforts to do so\\". The 2018 report highlighted \\"only three prosecutions\\" and \\"deficiencies in victim identification and referral\\" as reasons for the downgrading.  Legislation  In Ireland, human trafficking offences are governed by the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008 and the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) (Amendment) Act 2013. The 2008 act states that: In 2017 there were reportedly three prosecutions under this legislation.  US State Department reports  The US Trafficking Victims Protection Act (TVPA), as amended, requires the US Secretary of State to submit an Annual Report to the US Congress assessing the actions of various countries across the world in the fight against trafficking in persons. The US State Department on Thursday released a report showing a 73 per cent increase in the number of detected cases of human trafficking in Ireland since 2014. Ireland still retained Tier 1 Status in the US State Department Annual Human Trafficking Report of 2015. Ireland's Tier 1 status means the country's controls met the minimum standard for the elimination of severe forms of trafficking. As the Republic of Ireland had been assessed by the State Department as meeting the minimum standard for the elimination of severe forms of trafficking as set out in the US Trafficking Victims Protection Act (TVPA), (as amended) it retained its top Tier 1 rating in 2015. Ireland had been classified as Tier 1 for the previous six years. As is the norm for all countries, including Tier 1 countries, the Report on Ireland contains a number of recommendations to be implemented going forward. These recommendations are addressed within the context of the development of the Second National Action Plan to Prevent and Tackle Human Trafficking across the world. U.S. State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons placed the country in \\"Tier 1\\" in 2017. However, in 2018 and 2019 the country was placed in \\"Tier 2\\". Other countries downgraded from Tier 1 to Tier 2, as of the 2019 report, included Germany and Denmark.

It includes a ventilation that generates \\"negative pressure\\" (pressure lower than of the surroundings) to allow air to flow into the isolation room but not escape from the room, as air will naturally flow from areas with higher pressure to areas with lower pressure, thereby preventing contaminated air from escaping the room. This technique is used to isolate patients with airborne contagious diseases such as: influenza (flu), measles, chickenpox, tuberculosis, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV), and Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).Negative Pressure Isolation Rooms & Tuberculosis (TB) Isolation Rooms, AirMont Inc. Retrieved 2010-03-10. Mechanism Schematic of a network of rooms where air (shown in blue) flows in one direction from the corridor into the negative pressure room (green). Exhaust air is safely removed from the area through a ventilation system. Negative pressure is generated and maintained by a ventilation system that removes more air from the room than air is allowed into the room. Air is allowed into the room through a gap under the door (typically about one half-inch high). Except for this gap, the room should be as airtight as possible, allowing no air in through cracks and gaps, such as those around windows, light fixtures and electrical outlets. Leakage from these sources can compromise or eliminate room negative pressure. Because generally there are components of the exhausted air such as chemical contaminants, microorganisms, or radioactive isotopes that would be unacceptable to release into the surrounding outdoor environment (indeed, the original purpose of the negative-pressure room), the air outlet must, at a minimum, be located such that it will not expose people or other occupied spaces. Commonly it is exhausted out the roof of the building. However, in some cases, such as with highly infections microorganisms in biosafety level 4 rooms, the air must first be mechanically filtered or disinfected by ultraviolet irradiation or chemical means before being released to the surrounding outdoor environment. In the case of nuclear facilities the air is monitored for the presence of radioactive isotopes and usually filtered before being exhausted through a tall exhaust duct to be released higher in the air away from occupied spaces. Monitoring and guidelines In 2003, the CDC published guidelines on infection control, which included recommendations regarding negative pressure isolation rooms. Still absent from the CDC are recommendations of acute negative pressure isolation room monitoring. This has led to hospitals developing their own policies, such as the Cleveland Clinic. Commonly used methods for acute monitoring include the smoke or tissue test and periodic (noncontinuous) or continuous electronic pressure monitoring.  Smoke/tissue test  Uses smoke or tissue paper to assess room pressurization. A capsule of smoke or a tissue is placed near the bottom of the door, if the smoke or tissue is pulled under the door, the room is negatively pressurized. The advantages of this test are that it is cost efficient and easily performed by hospital staff. The disadvantages are that it is not a continuous test and that it doesn't measure magnitude. Without a measure for magnitude, isolation rooms may be under or over pressurized, even though the smoke/tissue test is positive. A 1994 CDC recommendation stated TB isolation rooms should be checked daily for negative pressure while being used for TB isolation. If these rooms are not being used for patients who have suspected or confirmed TB but potentially could be used for such patients, the negative pressure in the rooms should be checked monthly .  Continuous electronic pressure monitoring  Uses an electronic device with a pressure port in the isolation room and an isolation port in the corridor to continuously monitor the pressure differential between the spaces. The advantages of this type of monitoring are that the test is continuous and an alarm will alert staff to undesirable pressure changes. The disadvantages of this monitoring are that pressure ports can become contaminated with particulates which can lead to inaccuracy and false alarms, the devices are expensive to purchase and install, and staff must be trained to use and calibrate these devices because the pressure differentials used to achieve the low negative pressure necessitate the use of very sensitive mechanical devices, electronic devices, or pressure gauges to ensure accurate measurements .

Description Lords of Creation was not set in a single genre but was designed to allow players to play their characters through scenarios in settings varying from fantasy to science fiction to modern espionage. Characters gained powers and skills as they progressed, including magical abilities and high tech cybernetics. Their progression leads to demigod status, the character becoming a \\"Lord of Creation\\" with the ability to create their own pocket universe. The game broke the fourth wall, encouraging players who had advanced their characters to Lord of Creation status to then in turn take the role of gamemaster, refereeing the game in their character's pocket universe. The game came in a box containing the rulebook, the Book of Foes (containing statistics for creatures to fight, historical figures and examples of other Lords of Creation), and dice. Three adventure modules were published for the game: The Horn of Roland was an introductory adventure, the beginning of which is set in a science fiction convention and eventually leads to the Bermuda Triangle. The Yeti Sanction was set in the 1980s (modern day at the time of publication) and involved the characters tracking down the kidnapped Secretary of State. It also came with a GM screen and the scenario included expanded rules for cars, vehicle modification, vehicular combat, and chases. Omegakron was set in the future, after a nuclear war in the city of Akron, Ohio. This module also came with a pad of blank character sheets for the game. Two other adventure modules were announced, The Tower of Ilium and The Mines of Voria, but were never released. Reception The game was reviewed in Steve Jackson Games Fantasy Gamer issue #6.

It belongs to the Atikamekw of Opitciwan band of the Atikamekw Nation.Government of Canada, Aboriginal Canada Portal - Obedjiwan 28  Geography  Route 1046 north of Obedjiwan Forest road 0212 en route to Obedjiwan Obedjiwan reserve is situated on the north shore of Gouin Reservoir, at (direct line) south of Chibougamau, north of Wemotaci and northwest of La Tuque. The reserve is located between Lake Kamitcikamac (west) and Wopisiw Bay (East). In front (south side), there is the tip Martel Kiwam jutting into the lake Mamette. The reserve is an enclave within the City of La Tuque. It is the most isolated Atikamekw reserve in Quebec. It is accessible by a long gravel forest road of , which reaches towards the east Quebec Route 167 linking Saint-F√©licien to Chibougamau. Hence the distance by road to reach Chibougamau is . From Obedjiwan, Forest road 1045 reaches westward Forest Road 1009, built in the north-south axis to circumvent the Gouin Reservoir to the west; this road goes up to Chapais. The road distance between Obedjiwan and La Tuque is 319 km (198 miles), with a forest road bypassing the Gouin Reservoir on the east side. Toward West, the distance Obedjiwan-Senneterre is . In this context of distance, the aircraft is a mode of transportation widely used. Etymology The word Obedjiwan, written in the standardized Atikamekw spelling as Opitciwan, comes from the roots oba or obe meaning \\"strait\\", and djwan meaning \\"running\\". So, it can be translated as \\"current of the strait/narrows/pass\\". The name, first attributed to the lake, has undergone many spelling variations. In 1825, when the Hudson's Bay Company set up a post, they called it Waupatchinauganiskau, which is understood to be the original form of the toponym. In 1871, explorer John P. Bignell visited the place and made mention of the name Obidjouan. In 1904, the Fifth Report of the Geographic Board of Canada called it Obiduan and this remained the accepted form until 1964. Other variations included Obijuan and Wabijiwoine. History The area of the upper Saint-Maurice River had long been the homeland of the Atikamekw indigenous people. Lake Obedjiwan (a lake at the headwaters of the Saint-Maurice River that was inundated during the construction of Gouin Reservoir) was located along important canoe routes to Lac Saint-Jean via Lake Necouba (Lac Nicabau) and to James Bay. In the 17th century, and perhaps since prehistoric times, the shores of this lake were a gathering and trading place for the Atikamekw, as well as other indigenous people of surrounding areas, where they engaged in social, economic, and cultural interaction. The Atikamekw procured wheat, flour, and perhaps firearms from the Hurons, in exchange for moose or beaver skins. Map of the planned Indian Reserve of Obijuan (Obedjiwan) in 1914 In 1825, the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) and the King's Posts Company established trading posts on Lake Obedjiwan, that quickly attracted indigenous hunters not only from the area, but also from the eastern James Bay and the upper Ottawa River regions. In 1840, the Hudson's Bay Company deserted Lake Obedjiwan and settled at Kikendatch Lake (now Kikendatch Bay at the outlet of Gouin Reservoir). Yet in 1911, the HBC transferred its Kikendatch Post back to Lake Obedjiwan, causing the Atikamekw also to return to the area. The HBC wanted to move away from competing dealers who undermined its trade at Kikendatch while the Atikamekw liked to avoid Europeans who became more and more numerous in the south. At that time, there was still no real settlement although the Oblates built a chapel in 1916, which was located on the left bank of the Saint-Maurice River opposite of the HBC Post, separated by the Obedjiwan Narrows. Atikamekw, HBC, Lake Obedjiwan The area experienced a great change when the dam at La Loutre was constructed in 1917. The reservoir forming behind the dam flooded not only hundreds of lakes, including Lake Obediwan, but also the old settlement and its archaeological sites. A new village, 3 kilometers (2 miles) west at the current location, was not actually built until 1925 following arduous negotiations with the Commission des eaux courantes. On December 31, 1941, the Quebec Government proclaimed the Lands and Forests Act that provided for the reservation of lands for the benefit of \\"Indians\\". On January 14, 1944, an area of in the geographic township of Toussaint was transferred from the Government of Quebec to the Government of Canada, and was officially established as the \\"Obiduan Indian Reserve\\" on March 21, 1950. It was renamed to \\"Obedjiwan Indian Reserve\\" on January 23, 1964.Natural Resources Canada - Legal Surveys Division, Historical Review - Obedjiwan In 2002, the Atikamekw of Opitciwan initiated claims with the government of Canada in order to get compensated for the land and the goods lost in the flooding, the delay in the creation of the reserve, and the inadequate size of the reserve created.

It was developed and published by Changyou.com. Blade Wars is inspired by martial arts and takes place in a fantasy universe where three playable races, the Abyssals, Humans, and Immortals battle for dominance in PVP encounters.  Gameplay  The game features F2P martial arts and uses an isometric view and employs a control scheme similar to the one used in RuneScape and the Diablo game series. The battle system is based on a dynamic algorithm that factors in a player's level, the time between attacks and the enemy's position. Players are able to feign attacks or dodge an opponent's strikes. Skill combinations can be customized to result in powerful attacks, which generate extra damage during a battle. The game incorporates many of the features found in Changyou's previously released title, Dragon Oath. Mounts, trading, guild battles and daily events are included in Blade Wars. Unlike Dragon Oath, Blade Wars uses a 2.5D graphics engine, mixing 2D and 3D graphics into an isometric view. The game allows players to use strategy in customizing the fighting system and encourages skilled players to challenge each other for supremacy. After choosing one of the five classes available (Knight, Assassin, Shura, Warlock, or Warrior), players will be able to dive and explore a visually stunning world filled with challenges and fierce wars.  Development and release  Promotion at E3 2010 Originally released in China in 2007, Blade Wars received an English adaptation and was launched on American and British markets in 2010.  Reception  Blade Wars received an award in 2009 from the Chinese gaming site Wangyou for Original Title of the Year.

Google, Inc., 640 F. Supp. 2d 1193 (N.D. Cal. Jul. 30, 2009), is a case in which Jenna Goddard (\\"Plaintiff\\") alleged that she and a class of similarly situated individuals were harmed by Google (\\"Defendant\\") as a result of clicking allegedly fraudulent web-based advertisements for mobile subscription services (\\"MSSPs\\"). The United States District Court for the Northern District of California held that the action was barred by Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act (\\"CDA\\") and dismissed the complaint without leave to amend. Facts and procedural history While on Google's search results page, Plaintiff clicked on advertisements that led her to allegedly fraudulent websites. She then entered her cell phone number on the allegedly fraudulent sites to download ringtones, an action for which she was unknowingly charged. Plaintiff filed a lawsuit against Google on April 13, 2008, claiming that she was an intended third-party beneficiary of Google's AdWords Content Policy that Google failed to adequately enforce by aiding and abetting the fraud sites.Goddard v. Google, Inc., No. 08-2738, 2008 WL 5245490, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 101890 (N.D. Cal. Dec. 17, 2008). Google asserted that each of Plaintiff's claims was barred by the CDA, which prevents a website from being treated as the \\"publisher or speaker\\" of third-party content. The court rejected Plaintiff's \\"artful\\" pleading and dismissed her complaint with leave to amend in a decision issued on December 17, 2008. In her amended complaint, Plaintiff alleged that \\"Google's involvement in creating the allegedly fraudulent advertisements was so pervasive that the company controlled much of the underlying commercial activity engaged in by the third-party advertisers.\\"Goddard v. Google, Inc., 640 F. Supp. 2d 1193 (N.D. Cal. Jul. 30, 2009). She further asserted that Google \\"not only encourages illegal conduct, but collaborates in the development of the illegal content and, effectively, requires its advertiser customers to engage in it.\\"  Section 230(c) of the CDA  Protection for \\"good samaritan\\" blocking and screening of offensive material. Protection for private blocking and screening of offensive material. (1) Treatment of publisher or speaker‚ÄîNo provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.  Decision  The court relied on Carafano v. Metrosplash.com, which found that the CDA provides \\"robust\\" immunity for internet service providers and websites where courts have adopted \\"a relatively expansive definition of 'interactive computer service' and a relatively restrictive definition of 'information content provider.'\\" Therefore, a website operator is not liable as an \\"information content provider\\" merely by augmenting the content of online material generally. Rather, the website must contribute \\"materially ... to its alleged unlawfulness.\\" A website does not so contribute when it merely provides third parties with neutral tools to create web content, even if the website has knowledge that third parties are using such tools to create illegal content.  Developer liability  Plaintiff alleged that Google's Keyword Tool is not a \\"neutral tool\\" because when a potential advertiser enters the word \\"ringtone\\" into Google's Keyword Tool, the tool suggests the word \\"free.\\" According to Plaintiff, this suggestion is \\"neither innocuous nor neutral\\" because Google is aware of the \\"mobile content industry's unauthorized charge problems.\\" The court rejected Plaintiff's argument that the Keyword Tool materially contributes to the alleged illegality and thereby establishes developer liability. The court cited Carafano v. Metrosplash.com, where it ruled that \\"if a particular tool 'facilitates the expression of information,' it generally will be considered 'neutral' so long as users ultimately determine what content to post, such that the tool merely provides 'a framework that could be utilized for proper or improper purposes.'\\" Thus, like the menus in Carafano, Google's Keyword Tool is a neutral tool that merely provides options to advertisers. Plaintiff further alleged that Google effectively requires advertisers to engage in illegal conduct. The court held that Plaintiff's use of the word \\"requires\\" is inconsistent with the allegation that Google \\"suggests\\" words to the advertisers. The court referred to the Ninth Circuit ruling in Fair Housing Council of San Fernando Valley v. Roommates.com, LLCFair Housing Counsel of San Fernando Valley v. Roommates.com Inc., 521 F.3d 1157 (9th Cir. 2008) (en banc). where CDA immunity was denied because the website forced subscribers to disclose protected characteristics and discriminatory preferences as \\"a condition of using its services.\\" The court thereby concluded that Plaintiff's reasoning failed to disclose a \\"requirement\\" of any kind or suggest the type of \\"direct and palpable\\" involvement that otherwise is required to obviate CDA immunity. Contract claims in light of Barnes v. Yahoo! Plaintiff alleged that she and similarly situated individuals were intended third-party beneficiaries of Google's Advertising TermsGoogle's Advertising Terms. which include a Content Policy requiring that mobile subscription service advertisers display certain information about their products, including whether downloading the products will result in charges to the consumer. In Barnes v. Yahoo!, Inc.Barnes v. Yahoo! Inc., No. 05-36189 (9th Cir. Jun. 22, 2009). the court addressed the immunity of Yahoo! against Barnes' claim that it was either negligent in undertaking to remove, or breached an oral contract to remove, offensive and unauthorized content posted about the plaintiff by her ex-boyfriend on one of Yahoo!'s public profile pages. The court found that claims alleging that a website negligently undertook to remove harmful content are barred by the CDA. However, the court noted that certain promissory conduct by a defendant may remove it from the protections of the CDA even where the alleged promise was to remove or screen third-party content. Barnes implies that when a party engages in conduct giving rise to an independent and enforceable contractual obligation, that party may be liable not as a publisher or speaker of third- party content but instead under contract law. Here, however, there was no allegation that Google ever promised Plaintiff or anyone else that it would enforce its Content Policy. Also, even if Google had promised to enforce its Content Policy, Plaintiff would not be a third-party beneficiary of that promise: Google would be the promisor and the allegedly fraudulent MSSP would be a promisee. Thus, the court also rejected Plaintiff's contract claim. Holding Federal Judge Jeremy Fogel reasoned that \\"a plaintiff may not establish developer liability merely by alleging that the operator of a website should have known that the availability of certain tools might facilitate the posting of improper content.‚Äù The court held that Plaintiff's claims treat Google as the publisher or speaker of third-party content, but she failed to substantiate the \\"labels and conclusions\\" by which she attempted to escape the scope of the CDA. Further, the court emphasized that the CDA \\"must be interpreted to protect websites not merely from ultimate liability, but from having to fight costly and protracted legal battles.\\" For these reasons, the court dismissed the Plaintiff's complaint without leave to amend.

Early life On 11 November 1962, a 22-year-old man who joined the Syrian (St. Mary's) Monastery in Wadi Natroun in Egypt was ordained as a monk, with the name \\"Missael\\" after St. Missael the Anchorite, where Pope Shenouda III (117th Pope from 1971 - 2012) and Metropolitan Pachomious (the Patriarchal locum tennis in 2012) were fellow monks. Soon after his fellow monk Fr Antonious was ordained as Bishop Shenouda by Pope Cyril VI, Fr. Missael was ordained as a priest on 1 November 1967, and later a hegumen on 17 May 1969 by Bishop Shenouda. It is known that Fr Missael served for a period of four years as secretary of Pope Cyril VI. After the death of Pope Cyril VI, Bishop Shenouda was enthroned as his successor in 1971, becoming Pope Shenouda III. He appointed Fr. Missael as his first secretary. Ordination as Bishop and being sent to the United Kingdom Pope Shenouda III called his secretary to be ordained as a General Bishop, ordaining him on 25 May 1980; Bishop Missael was sent to the United Kingdom, becoming the first bishop from the Coptic Orthodox Patriarchate to reside there. During his time as General Bishop, Bishop Missael consecrated St. Mary & St. Antony's Coptic Orthodox Church in 1985 and established St. Mary & St. Mark's Coptic Orthodox Centre in 1989 - both in Birmingham. On 26 May 1991 Bishop Missael was ordained as the first diocesan bishop for the Diocese of Birmingham by Pope Shenouda III. This was the first diocese established by the Coptic Orthodox Patriarchate in all the lands of immigration (including Europe, America, Australia). In 2006 the Diocese of Birmingham was renamed the Diocese of the Midlands in the United Kingdom. Bishop Missael is based at St. Mary & St. Mark's Coptic Orthodox Centre in Birmingham, and oversees the diocese, which has around 11 churches and communities.

He has significantly contributed to the establishment of comparative history as a research field in East-Central Europe. Hroch defined three chronological stages in the creation of a nation: * Phase A: Activists strive to lay the foundation for a national identity. They research the cultural, linguistic, social and sometimes historical attributes of a non- dominant group in order to raise awareness of the common traits‚Äîbut they do this \\"without pressing specifically national demands to remedy deficits.\\" * Phase B: \\"A new range of activists emerged, who sought to win over as many of their ethnic group as possible to the project of creating a future nation.\\" * Phase C: The majority of the population forms a mass movement. \\"In this phase, a full social movement comes into being and movement branches into conservative- clerical, liberal and democratic wings, each with its own program.\\" Hroch's definition of nation: \\"Now the 'nation is not, of course, an eternal category, but was the product of a long and complicated process of historical development in Europe. For our purposes, let us define it at the outset as a large social group integrated not by one but by a combination of several kinds of objective relationships (economic, political, linguistic, cultural, religious, geographical, historical), and their subjective reflection in collective consciousness. Many of these ties could be mutually substituable - some playing a particularly important role in one nation-building process, and no more than a subsidiary part in others. But among them, three stand out as irreplaceable: #a 'memory' of some common past, treated as a 'destiny' of the group - or at least of its core constituents; #a density of linguistic or cultural ties enabling a higher degree of social communication within the group than beyond it; #a conception of the equality of all members of the group organized as a civil society.\\" Books * Social preconditions of national revival in Europe, 1985, English translation of Die Vork√§mpfer der nationalen Bewegungen bei den kleinen V√∂lkern Europas, Praha, 1968, . * In the National Interest.

At first instance he was likewise found not guilty by reason of insanity as his case fell under the M'Naghten Rules. This would entail a possible stigma and a treatment plan. His defence team appealed arguing such automatism was no form of 'insanity' but fell within the class of automatism such as a spiked drink which could show a complete lack of mens rea, outwith the realms of normal mental health, to make him guilty. The court ruled that violent sleepwalking with no external triggers was considered insane automatism. Thus the appeal was heard, argued, the law and its consequences judicially considered. The appeal was dismissed. Facts On 2 June 1988 Burgess attacked his friend Miss Katrina Curtis. She had fallen asleep on a sofa and woke up when Burgess, while allegedly sleepwalking, hit her over the head with a bottle. He subsequently picked up a video tape recorder and hit her on the head with it, giving her cuts and bruises. He put his hands around her throat, and when she said, \\"I love you Bar,\\" it appeared that he came to his senses, and he called for an ambulance. Judgement On 20 July 1989 the Crown Court found Burgess not guilty by reason of insanity on a charge of wounding with intent. He was ordered to be detained at a psychiatric hospital. Under section 12 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1968, Burgess appealed the decision. Appeal The defendant brought in psychiatrist Dr. d‚ÄôOrban and neuropsychiatrist Dr. Eames for medical evidence. The prosecution called in neuropsychiatrist Dr. Fenwick who contended that the incident was not run-of-the-mill sleepwalking, but perhaps a hysterical dissociative state. The judge, Lord Lane said, \\"We accept of course that sleep is a normal condition, but the evidence in the instant case indicates that sleep walking, and particularly violence in sleep, is not normal.\\" It was found that the violent action was due to an internal, organic cause, rather than an external one. Thus, the appeal was dismissed. Implications The sleepwalking in this case was violent and had a possibility of recurrence, so it could be considered a form of insanity.

She spent her childhood between Barbizon and Paris, receiving her musical education from her mother and family friends including Charles Lamoureux and Camille Chevillard. With her sisters she formed a piano trio which gave its first concert in Paris on 25 February 1895. She was the daughter of painter Ferdinand Chaigneau and Louise Deger, the twin sister of the cellist Marguerite and the sister of pianist Th√©r√®se, with whom she played as the Trio Chaigneau. In 1910 she married the son of violinist Joseph Joachim, Hermann Joachim, an officer in the German army, and was the mother of the singer Ir√®ne Joachim. The Chaigneau home welcomed many artistic visitors and was also considered close to the Dreyfusard cause, with Georges Picquart among other visitors to the home. The Trio Chaigneau played in London and Edinburgh and, with assistance from Joachim, undertook a tour of Germany in 1905. Their repertoire was both the Austro-German classics ‚Äì Beethoven, Brahms, Mozart ‚Äì and modern French composers. Apart from a few appearances in 1920, the Trio ended at the start of the First World War. Suzanne Chaigneau was stranded in Berlin during the war, and her husband died of tuberculosis in 1917. However she was able to continue with musical activity which brought her into contact with Wanda Landowska and Carl Flesch. Although she was able to send her daughter back to France in 1918, she herself was only able to return around 1920. Back in Paris she taught the violin, and founded the Institut moderne du violon with Lucien Capet in 1924. She also became a music correspondent for the Berliner Tageblatt, signing her articles as 'S Francoeur'. In 1926 and 1927 Chaigneau spent time in Chicago with the Yanker family to teach her violin method.

The controversy involved the mislabeling of wines from vintners in southern France which were falsely sold to American distributors E & J Gallo Winery as Pinot noir. The mislabeling resulted in a French court convicting twelve people for fraud. Background Pinot noir wine is considered particularly difficult to make well. American law requires that wine sold as being from a single varietal must be at least 75% composed of the grape in question, and within the European Union, the requirement is a minimum of 85%. Accordingly, many American winemakers add less expensive but more robust Merlot and Syrah to improve the mainstream appeal of inexpensive Pinot noir. California wine brands often sell Pinot noir from France, Italy, Chile, and Germany, because it is less expensive to produce there than locally. As a result of the blending and importation practices, wine sold as Pinot noir often does not have the characteristic taste of the grape, and can easily be confused by consumers and experts for other varietals. Languedoc has been known for centuries for producing simpler and cheaper wine, which has sometimes been passed off by wine merchants as more expensive wine from Bordeaux or Burgundy. The French Appellation d'Origine Contr√¥l√©e (AOC) system was created in the 1930s to prevent the practice of mislabeling or diluting expensive wines with cheaper ones. The fraud The American producer E&J; Gallo received a shipment of bulk wine sufficient to fill 18 million bottles, sold by wholesaler Sieur d'Arques as Pinot noir from the Languedoc-Roussillon wine region of France, which was actually a mix of Merlot and Syrah. Sieur d'Arques in turn had bought the wine from Ducasse Wine Merchants, a wine broker, which had bought less expensive Merlot and Syrah from at least eight agricultural cooperatives in the Carcassonne area. According to the Guardian, French authorities believe that Claude Courset, owner and general manager of Ducasse Wine Merchants, earned approximately 7 million euros from the scam to pass off \\"cheap plonk\\" as Pinot noir from January 2006 through March 2008. Gallo had sold the wine under the 2006 vintage of its Red Bicyclette label, at an approximately $8 retail price per bottle, as being 85% Pinot noir. Fake Pinot noir was also sold to Constellation Brands, and possibly other American brands. Prosecution The scheme was discovered during an audit of Ducasse Wine Merchants. French investigators were suspicious that the firm was buying Pinot noir wine at 40% less than the going rate, in quantities that exceeded the historical production level of the region. On February 17, 2010, 12 people from the Languedoc-Roussillon region of France were convicted by a court in Carcassonne in connection with the fraud, including the head of Ducasse, Claude Courset (described as the \\"kingpin\\" of the scheme), executives at Sieur d'Arques, and several cooperatives. Aftermath The scandal, described as the largest in French winemaking in recent years, was a public relations \\"nightmare\\" that hurt the credibility of the Red Bicyclette brand, and of French wine production generally, at least in the United States. Pinot noir had gained some recognition and popularity among American consumers, in large part due to a conceit in the 2004 independent film Sideways that it was superior to Merlot wine. As a result, consumers had been willing to pay more for the supposedly superior grape. The British press used the occasion to scoff at American consumers for their supposed lack of sophistication in wine. In March, 2010, a wine writer for the San Francisco Chronicle coined the name \\"Pinotgate\\" to describe the scandal. Gallo denied any prior knowledge of the fraud and was not accused of complicity. He has been accused by some of not sufficiently overseeing the quality and authenticity of wine purchased from suppliers. A class-action lawsuit was filed against Gallo in connection with selling the mislabeled bottles.

They are commonly known as starburst lichens. Taxonomy The genus was circumscribed by Susan Meyer in 1985 as a segregate of Parmeliopsis. In a previous study of Parmeliopsis, Meyer noted a group of species (represented by P. aleurites and P. placorodia) that would be better accommodated in a separate genus. This had been previously noted by other lichenologists: in 1932, Vilmos Gyelnik proposed the section Pallidifera to include the grey species of Parmeliopsis; in 1936 Johannes Hillmann proposed section Rectoconidia to contain species with short and straight conidia. Meyer created Imshaugia on the basis of its emergent and partly marginal pycnidia (they are immersed and laminal in Parmeliopsis), its short, ampulliform (flask-shaped) or bifusiform (tapering at both ends) conidia (these are long and curved in Parmeliopsis), and the presence of Cetraria-type lichenan in its cell walls rather than isolichenan as in Parmeliopsis. The generic name honours Henry Andrew Imshaug, \\"in recognition of his contributions to lichenology.\\" Imshaugia species are commonly known as \\"starburst lichens\\". Description Imshaugia lichens are foliose with a mineral-grey to whitish- grey thallus and a whitish to light brown lower surface. They grow as small rosettes, comprising small lobes measuring 1‚Äì2 mm wide. Pseudocyphellae and soredia are absent from the thallus, but isidia may be present. The upper cortex is paraplectenchymatous (a cell arrangement where the hyphae are oriented in all directions), measuring 10‚Äì20 Œºm thick, and covered by an epicortex with pores. The apothecia are Lecanora-type, resembling large, concave brown discs. Ascospores are colourless, ellipsoid, and number eight per ascus. Conidia have a short bacilliform shape with a swelling towards one end, and measure 3‚Äì4.5 Œºm long. The phycobiont in Imshaugia is green algae ‚Äì Trebouxia in I. aleurites, and Myrmecia in I. placorodia. The thallus contains thamnolic acid and atranorin. Habitat and distribution Imshaugia placorodia, photographed in the Black Hills of South Dakota. Scale bar is 5 mm Imshaugia grows most commonly on the bark and wood of conifers, and prefers woodland habitats that are open and well-lit. They have also been recorded on hardwoods and wood fences. The South American species I. sipmanii, however, is saxicolous. Imshaugia placorodia has been noted to display a preference for the bark of the tree species pitch pine (Pinus rigida) and Jack pine (Pinus banksiana). The type species, Imshaugia aleurites, is widely distributed in northern North America, having been recorded from the tree line in the Arctic south through all of the boreal region and most of the temperate region.

The city is mentioned first in 1350 and existed until 1600, when the city together with Lyck√• lost its city charter in favor of the newly fortress city Kristianopel. During the 14th century, the Danes re-conquered Blekinge. Avask√§r's history is not very well known since the King Valdemar IV of Denmark (1320‚Äì137) is said to have destroyed all the documents from this period. During the Middle Ages, Avask√§r was one of Denmark's smallest cities, located only six kilometers from the Swedish border. The city suffered from numerous depredations and fires during the regular Swedish- Danish wars of the 15th and 16th centuries. In 1451, King Charles VIII of Sweden (1408-1470) and King Christian I of Denmark (1426‚Äì1481) met in Avask√§r to resolve a conflict. Denmark and Sweden had been at war since 1449 over which country had the right to Gotland. No significant resolve was reached as a result of this meeting. During the Nordic Seven Years' War, the town was burned down by Swedes on 15 September 1563. The city was rebuilt, but its heyday was over. In 1598, Sigismund III Vasa (1566‚Äì1632) arrived with his fleet to Avask√§r and traveled from there to Kalmar to assert his right to the throne of Sweden (see War against Sigismund). The following year, King Christian IV of Denmark decided to found a better fortified town named Kristianopel, and the name Avask√§r receded from history.

Omaha Tribe, 442 U.S. 653 (1979), was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States held that in a land dispute, 25 U.S.C. ¬ß 194. applied only to individuals and not a state, that federal law governed the tribe's right to possession, but that state law was to be used in determining how that applied to the natural movement of a river's boundaries.. Background In 1854, the Omaha Tribe and the United States entered into a treaty that provided for the tribe to have a reservation in Nebraska, bounded on the east by the center line of the Missouri River. In 1867, a survey by the Federal General Land Office established the boundaries. During the intervening years, changes in the river's course occurred. leaving a good deal of land from the survey on the Iowa side of the river. Non-Indian farmers had also occupied the land in question over those same year. On April 2, 1975, the tribe dispossessed the farmers with the assistance of the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) and the State of Iowa, Wilson, and others filed suits to obtain title to the land in Iowa claimed by the tribe. District Court The multiple lawsuits were consolidated into one action in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Iowa. The trial court found for the non-Indian defendants, using the state law of Nebraska to determine the issue of the movement of the river, rejecting the position of the United States and the tribe that 25 U.S.C. ¬ß 194 controlled the issue. Circuit Court The tribe then appealed the trial court's decision to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals. The appeals court reversed the judgment of the trial court, holding that 25 U.S.C. ¬ß 194 did apply. The court stated that once the tribe made a prima facie case, the burden fell on both the non-Indian litigants to prove their case and that the trial court improperly put the burden on the tribe. The court further held that Federal common law governed, not state law as far as the movement of the river was concerned. The non-Indians appealed and the U.S. Supreme Court granted certiorari. Opinion of the Court Vacated and remanded. Justice Byron White delivered the opinion of the court. Justice White stated that first, 25 U.S.C. ¬ß 194 did in fact apply to the case as to the individuals and corporations but not to the State of Iowa, and that the defendants had the burden of proof once the tribe established their prima facie case. He also stated that the Circuit Court was correct that federal law governed, but was in error by arriving at a federal standard that was independent of state law. Concurring Opinion Justice Harry Blackmun issued a concurring opinion, in which he discusses the term \\"white person\\" in 25 U.S.C. ¬ß 194 as being applied to corporations and any non-Indian.

Under Merrifield, Loyola Marymount went through a period of rapid expansion in which thirteen new buildings were constructed on the main campus. Biography=Early life Fr. Merrifield was born in Los Angeles on November 14, 1928. He graduated from Inglewood High School. Fr. Merrifield received his bachelor's degree in physics from California Institute of Technology in 1950. He went on to obtain a master's degree in physics from University of Notre Dame in 1951 and his doctorate in physics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (M.I.T.) in 1962. Career Donald Merrifield entered the Society of Jesus in 1951 and was ordained a Roman Catholic priest in 1965 at Blessed Sacrament Catholic Church, Hollywood. He taught physics at the University of San Francisco, Santa Clara University and Loyola University of Los Angeles before becoming president of Loyola in 1969. He also worked as a consultant at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California from 1962 until 1969. Loyola Marymount University Fr. Merrifield was appointed as the 11th President of the Loyola University of Los Angeles in 1969. Instead of elaborate inauguration celebrations, he asked that celebrations be kept simple so extra funds could be spent on minority scholarships. A strong advocate for interfaith relations, Merrifield had Rabbi Alfred Wolf give the invocation at his inauguration. When Loyola University and nearby Marymount College merged and assumed the name Loyola Marymount University, Fr. Merrifield was selected to remain president of the university. The academic vice president of Marymount College, Sister Renee Harrangue, R.S.H.M., Ph.D., was appointed Provost. Under Fr. Merrifield, thirteen new buildings were constructed on Loyola Marymount's Westchester neighborhood of Los Angeles. The thirteen buildings constructed during Merrifield's tenure as president include the Von der Ahe Communication Arts Building, the George Page Baseball Stadium, Doolan Hall, Gersten Pavilion, Burns Fine Art Center, the Laband Art Gallery, the Leavey Faculty Center and the Loyola Apartments. Fr. Merrifield also oversaw the expansion of Loyola Law School's campus in Pico-Union, near downtown Los Angeles. Merrifield and the university commissioned internationally known architect Frank Gehry to design the new campus, which was needed to accommodate increased enrollment. He also emphasized increased minority enrollment in the university's admissions process through scholarships, recruitment drives and financial aid. Loyola Marymount added Latino and African American studies programs to its curriculum during his time in office. Merrifield also helped to form the Loyola Marymount Mexican American Alumni Association in 1981. He worked closely with the brothers of the Missionaries of Charity to benefit the homeless of Los Angeles. Merrifield stepped down as president of Loyola Marymount in 1984 and was succeeded by James N. Loughran, S.J. However, he remained at the university as its chancellor until 2002. Later life Father Merrifield was assigned to the Jesuit community in Honolulu, Hawaii, in 2003. While living in Hawaii Merrifield worked with Oahu's Hispanic population, a prison ministry, and the Catholic community in the MƒÅnoa-Punahou area. He continued to be actively involved in university and student life in Hawaii. He served on the board of governors for Chaminade University of Honolulu. He also became involved with the Newman Center at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, where he led retreats for students. Merrifield provided breakfast for dozens of homeless at Ala Moana Beach Park twice a week, using his own money. The breakfasts gradually became known as \\"Fr. Don's Kitchen,\\" inspiring Honolulu area parishes, namely St. Pius X and Sacred Heart, to offer breakfasts to approximately 360 homeless people at parks around the city. Last years He moved to an assisted living facility in for elderly Jesuits in Los Gatos, California in 2008. Father Merrifield died from a heart attack at Good Samaritan Hospital in San Jose, California, on February 25, 2010, at the age of 81.

A Dutch expedition under the command of Boudewijn Hendricksz attacked the island of Puerto Rico, but despite besieging San Juan for two months, was unable to capture it from Spain. Background The Twelve Years' Truce brought recognition of the Dutch Republic by Spain, while its end saw Dutch assistance from France and England, and the start of the Thirty Years' War. The Estates General sought an aggressive commercial expansion into the New World, which included the formation of the Dutch West India Company, and the financing of privateers to prey upon Spanish and Portuguese shipping. Battle On 24 September 1625, 17 Dutch ships arrived at San Juan de Puerto Rico, whose Spanish governor ‚Äî naval and military veteran Captain General Juan de Haro y Sanvitores ‚Äî had been in office less than a month. Nevertheless, he got ready to receive the enemy as best he could preparing El Morro's battery to close the main entrance to the San Juan Bay, and sending his predecessor, Juan de Vargas, to nearby Boquer√≥n with militia to hinder any landings in the Escambr√≥n Inlet. Cannon were placed at Boquer√≥n and Goat's Creek, and trenches dug. Hendricksz implemented a bold plan. At 1:00 P.M. the next day the entire Dutch fleet sailed directly into San Juan‚Äôs harbor, led by his flagship. Both sides exchanged fire, but the fleet was soon past El Morro, with the Dutch flagship suffering only 4 dead and a few wounded. However, shoals prevented an immediate disembarkation of troops. The delay allowed Spanish civilians to flee inland over San antonio Bridge, while the governor marshaled his slender strength of 330 men within Castillo San Felipe del Morro. On 26 September, Hendricksz led 800 men ashore and occupied the empty city, making La Fortaleza his headquarters. The Dutch occupied El Ca√±uelo and the San Antonio Bridge, cutting El Morro off from supplies. The Dutch began digging siege trenches, and installing a 6 cannon on a height called \\"Calvary\\". Hendricksz demanded the surrender of the fort, \\"in the name of the States General and of his Highness the Prince of Orange, \\"threatening otherwise that \\"we will spare neither old nor young, woman nor child.\\" Haro responded with a counter offer, \\"if you will deliver the ships in which you came to me, I will let you have one to return with.\\" From that day onwards, a 21-day cannon duel started with El Morro. Yet, Puerto Rican militiamen were able to recapture San Antonio Bridge, and Capt. Andr√©s Botello's partisans regained control of the Bayam√≥n River, while burning El Ca√±uelo. This allowed supplies to reach El Morro once again. By then the Dutch siege trenches had reached El Morro's glacis. On 4 Oct., Hero started ordering sorties of 80 men in 3 parties, with Juan de Am√©zqueta personally leading a sortie on 5 Oct. Hendricksz again called upon de Haro to capitulate on 21 October, \\"surrender, or we burn the town.\\" Hero responded with \\"We have enough courage and wood and stone to build again.\\" On 22 Oct., the Dutch started burning all buildings, over a 100 houses, including Bishop Balbueno's palace and library, and the city archives. Capt. Am√©zqueta led a sortie from El Morro, while Capt. Botello led one from San Antonio Bridge, which drove the Dutch from their trenches, as they retreated to their ships. Aftermath The Dutch finally fled on 2 November, leaving behind one of their ships and over 400 dead. Yet Spain learned she must strengthen Puerto Rico's defenses, and properly man them, to prevent future invasions.
