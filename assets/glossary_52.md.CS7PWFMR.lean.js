In the latter part of the century, seeking excitement, two scions of the family, Ernst Anton (b. 1680) and Maximilian (b. 1668), joined the Habsburg military and served in the border campaigns against the Ottoman Empire. Eventually, the brothers acquired distinction in such actions as the Battle of Lugos and the Uskok War they came to the notice of such commanders as Prince Eugene of Savoy, General Claudius Florimund Mercy, and the Louis, the Duke of Baden. The brothers achievements which continued in the military careers of their sons; by the latter third of the eighteenth century, the descendants of both brothers had acquired the title of Freiherr in the county of Moravia. In 1722, the titles of both brothers were converted from a Bohemian dignity to a Hungarian one. Two brothers In 1695, the two brothers joined Habsburg service under Count Friedrich Veterani in the seven cavalry regiments of 6500 men and 800 infantry at Lugos against Sultan Mustafa II. The Ottoman army included about 85,000 men (Janissaries, Spahis, and Tatars). Although initially Veterani's force drove the Turks back, Veterani was captured and beheaded on the battle field, and Ernst and Maximilian were wounded. D'Elvert, Christian, Petrasch, die Freiherren von, in: _Biographisches Lexikon des Kaisertums √ñsterreich_ 22 (1887), p. 103. =Ernst Anton= After the Treaty of Karlowitz (26 January 1699), Ernst Anton joined Count √îttingen in Smyrna; afterward he traveled to the Barbary states, the island of Sardinia, and to France, where he was in 1703 when the War of the Spanish Succession broke out. He joined the imperial army, in the same regiment of cuirassiers in which he had served earlier. He advanced up the grade of ranks to lieutenant colonel in the regiment Sch√∂nborn, via the patronage of Field Marshal Count Mercy, who instructed him to transport supplies to the besieged Panƒçevo, an exceptionally dangerous mission. On 16 April 1717, he embarked toward Petrovaradin, having previously received the sacraments, given the church 200 florins, and had the blessings of the a priest. He successfully delivered the supplies, and on the return was waylaid by the Turkish fleet which far outnumbered his own vessels. The powder in his ship ignited and exploded, and most of his crew were killed. Severely wounded himself, he was captured and brought to Belgrade, where the local Pasha treated him well. Eventually though, he was sent to Edirne where he was imprisoned in irons, and subsequently transported to Constantinople. There, he languished in one of the prisons, awaiting for his rescue or exchange. Mercy and Eugene of Savoy sent Colonel Baron von Neipperg to conclude a peace between Austria and Venice, and in the course of negotiations, Ernst Anton was freed when Mercy removed some Hungarian settlers from a contested border region. Following his release, he remained in Mercy's service. He was promoted to lieutenant field marshal in 1734 and served in Eugene of Savoy's campaign against the French. In one notable action, he moved under the guns of Mainz with 2,000 men to observe the enemy and report on the enemy movement, and to relieve Count Wallis. He had a son, Ernst Gottlieb. =Maximilian= Fortress of Gradisca, which Maximilian eventually captured. Maximilian joined the imperial army as a common cavalryman in the cuirassiers Gondola. He was badly injured at Lugos; this wound never healed and in later life made it difficult, or impossible, for him to mount a horse. In five years, he became an officer, but he fell into the hands of insurgents, who tried to persuade him to join their own party. By 1716, during the Uskok War he was a colonel and commander of the fortress of Slavonski Brod in Slavonia. He outwitted the contingent guarding Gradisca fortress, lured them into an ambush, then burned the city Gradisca to the ground. Lichard, Daniel, Petrasch, Maximilian Freiherr von in: _Biographisches Lexikon des Kaisertums √ñsterreich_ , vol, 22, p. 105. Like his brother, Maximilian became a favorite of Prince Eugene. When attacking Derlent, his old wound broke open and prevented him from mounting his horse, so he directed the attack from a litter. In 1718, he was stationed on the border along the Sava river to Belgrade, where he defended the fortress of Osijek against the attack of Claude Alexandre de Bonneval. In 1722 he received a barony from the Empress of Hungary. Eventually he retired to his estate near Breslau, where he died at the age of 56 after several weeks of suffering. He had married Maria Anna, Countess of Becker, and had a son, Joseph von Petrasch. Maximilian's city home in Olomec. Plan of Fortress at Slavonski Brod, where Maximilian was military commander. =Descendants= Joseph Joseph, Maximillian's son, was a scholar and a soldier. Born at Slavonski Brod in Slavonia 19 October 1714, he was the only son of the Maximilian from his marriage to Maria Anna Countess Beckers. He was educated by a canon of Trnava, Mathias Schupanschik, who taught him the first elements of the Latin, poetics and rhetoric; a lieutenant-colonel name Hay√ü taught him the mathematical sciences in the Spanish and Italian; then he came, probably because his father obtained a position in Moravia, to Olomouc, where he completed his philosophical studies at the Jesuit college and earned the Doctor philosophy when only 16 years old. He began the study of law at Louvain; subsequently, his parents sent him on a journey to Holland, England, Scotland, Ireland, France and Switzerland, the so-called European Grand Tour which took him to various learned institutions and libraries for close look at the greatest works of art, literature and science, and where he was encouraged by eminent men of science and reason to the path of Enlightenment. Schlossar, Anton, \\"Petrasch, Josef Freiherr von\\", in: _Biographisches Lexikon des Kaisertums √ñsterreich_ 25 (1887), pp. 516-517. Upon his return, barely 20 years old, he entered the imperial army and made adjutant of Prince Eugen some campaigns on the Rhine. He later received a company in one of the Danubian regiments, but further promotion was closed to him, once peace between Austria and France had been negotiated. He left the army, went traveling again, this time to the German universities. His mother's serious illness called him home, where he arrived three days before her death. At a young age, he found himself suddenly in possession of a considerable fortune, land, and title. He immediately resumed his journey in Germany. In W√ºrzburg, where he remained for a long time, he became acquainted with Anne von Hettersdorf. They married and he returned to Olomouc. Eventually they had three daughters. He continued his lifelong-learning, and founded the Society of Anonymous Scholars in the Austrian Lands, of which he was president until 1758. He died at Neuschlo√ü, his estate in Moravia, on 15 May 1772. Ernst Gottlieb Ernst Gottlieb, was son of Ernst Anton, had been born in Teschen, Austrian Silesia, in 1708. Like Joseph, he also enjoyed a good education; in 1728, at the age of 20, he became a cornet in the Cuirassiers Schmerzing, under the command of the Grand Duke Francis Stephen of Lorraine, who later to become Emperor Franz I. In the Turkish war he was proven as a brave soldier, was captain and last colonel. He inherited a title from his father, as hereditary master of Pehlin, a village in the County S√°ros. In 1760 he was captain the Arcieren-Garde (a guard unit of the French-Comte). The educated and informed baron soon gained the favor of the Empress Maria Theresa. Petrasch one who organized the illuminations and fireworks on the occasion of the second marriage of the Archduke with Josepha of Bavaria in the Schwarzenberg Garden. As an imperial favorite, he was given the castle Holitsch, and made master of Prerau. The Empress extended his father's barony to an Hungarian barony 30 January 1767. General Petrasch married Elizabeth von Fritz, a favorite maid of the Empress Maria Theresa, and they had a daughter, who married the baron Bretton, and a son, Franz, born in 1746 at the family estate in Prerau. Ernst Gottlieb died in Vienna on 30 June 1792. Vehse, Eduard, \\"Petrasch, Earnst Anton\\", in: _General German Biography_ 25 (1887), p. 101.

It is also significant as the home of William Connor, a prominent regional lumber baron, and as the home of his son Seldon, a general in the American Civil War and three-term Governor of Maine. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. Description and history The Connor-Bovie House is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, three bays wide, with a side gable roof, clapboard siding, and granite foundation. An ell extends to the rear, joined to a structure that probably served once as a carriage house. The bays of the south-facing main facade are delineated by paneled Doric pilasters, and the windows are framed by Italianate molding. The main entrance is sheltered by a portico, supported by paneled Doric columns, with a porch above. Both the main entrance and the doorway to the porch have flanking sidelight windows. The house was built 1856-68 by William Connor, one of the proprietors of the main lumber mill in Fairfield, and a major area landowner. Connor's son Seldon (1839-1917), served as a brigadier general in the Union Army during the American Civil War, and was Governor of Maine 1876-78.

While much has been written about him, particularly during the renaming controversy regarding Robertson Road, little of it has been documented. He has been described as a pioneer, weaver, foreman for the Rideau Canal, stone mason, mechanical engineer, storekeeper, farmer, major landowner, lumberman, pathmaster, surveyor of roads, Highway Commissioner, magistrate, councillor, warden of Nepean Township , agriculturalist, benefactor to his community, and an entrepreneur in his lifetime. He was born in Perthshire, Scotland in 1797 and became a silk weaver by trade before emigrating to Canada in 1827. That same year he purchased a partially cleared homestead in what would later become Bell's Corners. The Rev. J. L. Gourlay in his 1896 History of the Ottawa Valley described Robertson thusly: Robertson continued to work on the canal system until 1834 as well as farming. After the canal was finished, he began storekeeping and branched out into lumbering in the Township of Nepean and on the Bonnechere River. The first fair in the County of Carleton was held in Bell‚Äôs Corners in 1836 on land donated by John Robertson. He took a prominent and leading role for many years in the affairs of Nepean Township. He was pathmaster in 1837 collecting money for roads and supervising construction. On December 17, 1838, Robertson purchased 100 acres of lot 9, concession II, Ottawa front from John D. McKay. Then in September 1839, he received the first crown patent for all 200 acres of the adjacent lot 8. By 1855, he owned at least 1,100 acres in the Bell‚Äôs Corners area. The 1879 Belden map of the area also shows that he owned all of lot 35, concession V, Rideau front on the other side of what would later become Robertson Road where Westcliffe Estates is now located. Robertson and his wife had a number of children, among them sons Thomas and Ebenezer. Although Robertson sold various parcels of land over the years to others, what remained in the family was passed on or sold to Thomas. Thomas McKay Robertson is considered the first male white child born in Bytown. He established a store in 1841, which did the largest business in the area. While Robertson was well known for his farming, the Canada Directory of 1857-58 listed him as a Lt. Col. in the Carleton Battalion as well as a \\"dealer in dry goods, hardware, groceries, produce, &c.;\\" In 1842, Robertson was surveyor of roads in Nepean, then Highway Commissioner. He was a magistrate for nine years in the Township. In 1848 when Nepean commenced to run its own affairs alone there were 169 ratepayers in the Township entitled to vote, and John Robertson was elected Town Warden. In 1850, when Nepean Township was formally incorporated John Robertson was elected Councillor, a position he held for some years. John Robertson was one of the founders of the Bell‚Äôs Corners Union Cemetery in 1853. He was a very religious man and one who believed in education. Gourlay wrote: On March 18, 1868, John Robertson wrote an article published in The Canadian Farmer detailing his farming methods and their effect on crop yields and livestock production. Gourlay: His first wife died in 1869. He later remarried. However, the great fire of August 1870 destroyed his entire property. Gourlay wrote: In September 1880, John Robertson, then aged 83, wrote for his grandson, Ebenezer Robertson, a practical guide for all farming activities, with particular emphasis placed on the economics of farming. There were 280 pages of advice, wrapped in old Montreal newspapers. It was purchased in 1959 by the Manuscript Collection, Canadian History Department, Metropolitan Toronto. John Robertson died on 3 January 1884 at the age of 87. He is buried in the Bells Corners Union Cemetery.

It was located on Vine Street. At the time it was established, the California Laundry was one of the few laundry businesses in the country in which each machine was driven by an individual motor, eliminating the possibility of a breakdown which would cripple the entire plant. The machinery used in the California Laundry was the largest single shipment of laundry apparatus ever sent to the Pacific coast. Location The owners acquired the entire block on which the plant was located. Situated just south of Santa Monica Boulevard, the property had a frontage of of Vine Street. Parking was available on Vine Street and Eleanor Avenue. History Established in 1921, the laundry, representing an investment of $225,000, was an important addition to the industrial section of Hollywood. The machinery used in the California Laundry was the largest single shipment of laundry apparatus ever sent to the Pacific coast, and was bought at an expense of $126,000, not including the boilers and water heat controlling machines. Initially, 70 people were employed. For the first three months, they worked without phone connections. Expecting that the plant would have to be enlarged, the company owned the property just west of their initial building, allowing for expansion. The business was directed by Henry Newby and D. N. Childers. Newby, the president, was associated with banking institutions in Pasadena, California for twenty- five years. He resigned as chairman of the National Bank of Pasadena when he became assistant manager of the Hotel Alexandria, of Los Angeles. He was a director of the Troy Laundry Company, operating the Troy Laundry at Pasadena. Childers, the vice-president and manager, resigned his position as manager of the laundry of the Hotel Alexandria, a position that he had held for two years, to start up the California Laundry. Before becoming manager of the Hotel Alexandria‚Äôs laundry, Childers was superintendent of the San Bernardino Steam Laundry at San Bernardino. The construction of the California Laundry plant had been under his direct supervision. Charles Greenberg, a Hollywood attorney, was secretary. J. A. Henley, Roy A. Henley, Frank G. Hogan, and L. J. Killian were on the Board of Directors. Operations The laundry operated in a rotary fashion. Each of the drivers of the 26 trucks deposited his bundles in bins, from which they were taken to the marking and sorting rooms. Here all silks, woolens, and fancy pieces were removed to be washed by hand. The plant operated 10 washers. Among the other machinery were two large flat work ironers, an handkerchief ironer, two drying tumblers, nine pressing machines, and a curtain dryer. The clothing was washed in revolving machines, in filtered water with pure soap, and rinsed five times. The wringers were centrifugal. The thermostatic control heater kept the water at all times less than 180 degrees, while the water filtering tanks removed the elements harmful to linens and other materials. The room next to that in which these tanks were located on the second floor was the store room, which contained barrels of starch, automobile tires, paper boxes, and almost a ton of twine. There was a large dryer, made especially for bath towels, which dried them by a hot air process. The flat work was protected in the mangles by canvas belts and aprons. Men's shirts were mended and the cuffs turned if worn along the fold. Stockings were dried and shaped at the same time on metal forms. A stiff collar required more steps in the process of being laundered than any other article. Two tanks, each of 1400 gallons capacity, contained soap flakes with the appropriate amount of water. These 2800 gallons lasted only two days at the most. The rough-dry work was done in a different part of the building, and the accounting for this department were kept separately. One person was employed for placing new satin ribbon of different colors in ladies' garments, and tying blankets with ribbon bows. Architecture and fittings The one- story plant building measured in size, and was of reinforced concrete construction. There was a mezzanine floor on three sides. The ceiling measured in height, and the sides were largely made up of windows. The all white exterior was surrounded with lawn, flowers, and shrubs. A pergola, in length, reached from the southern extremity of the building to Romaine Street and was intended as a dining area for employees. On two sides of the building, there was a wide concrete driveway. The interior of the building was finished in white, with the exception of the steel rafters high up in the center of the building, these having been painted a light green. The fixtures were also painted white. There was no overhead belt or shaft in the entire plant, as every machine was motor driven. The electrical work was under the floor. All the pipes which ran through the plant had an asbestos covering. The rough dry department occupied a space in the rear of the building. In one corner of the plant was a boiler room, with all condensation trapped back to the boiler. A reinforced wall, inside the building and against the rear wall, made an enclosure and above this was an additional story for the water softening plant, as well as the soap and bleach making equipment. The marking room, measuring , was on the mezzanine floor running along the west side of the building. It employed an elevator to bring the work from the first floor to the marking room. It also contained a system of chutes. The mezzanine floor also contained a storeroom, ; across one wall of it, lockers with shelves were used for smaller supplies. A dining room and kitchen were also situated on that floor, running across the east side of the building. The plant had three furnished offices. On the first floor was a public office, opening on Vine Street; situated on the mezzanine floor above was a general office and the private office of Newby and Childers. A dressing room for men employees opened into a bath room equipped with shower baths on the west side of the building. There was a large locker room, a clinic, and a dining room.

In 2015, Kiesel Guitars split from Carvin Corporation, taking the guitar and bass portions of Carvin. History Carvin Guitar's model V220, custom built for Craig Chaquico of Jefferson Starship Lowell Kiesel founded the L. C. Kiesel Company in San Diego, California in 1946, to manufacture guitar pickups. By 1947, the company manufactured steel guitars in Gothenburg, Nebraska. Around 1948, it returned to Southern California‚Äîand, in 1949, moved to Baldwin Park, California, where the company name changed to Carvin Corporation, after Kiesel's two eldest sons, Carson and Gavin. Starting in the 1970s, Mark Kiesel took over the guitar department and started offering custom instruments made to order to allow customers to choose from a range of available body shapes, woods, colors, electronics, and other features. In 1995, Jeff Kiesel started working for the company, and in 2011 he began to help with design and instrument development. Carvin Guitar's JB200C Jason Becker Tribute Guitar, at the 2014 NAMM Show In 2015, Carvin Corporation split its business units, and Kiesel Guitars was founded to take over the guitar and bass manufacturing, as a wholly separate company. The original Kiesel name and logo was chosen to honor founder Lowell Kiesel. The new company continues to build electric, acoustic electric, MIDI, synth, semi hollow, chambered, headless guitars and basses along with necks, bodies, kits and a full parts department under the Carvin Guitars name as well as new Kiesel name. Kiesel Guitars opened up sales globally following the name change. The company employed over 50 people and produced almost 4,000 custom made instruments per year. It is run by President Mark Kiesel (Lowell Kiesel's middle son) and Vice President Jeff Kiesel (Mark's son). Jeff Kiesel's two children also work for the company when not attending school full-time. Example of a Kiesel Guitar's 4x3 headstock design In January 2015, Kiesel Guitars won Revolver's Best of Show award at the winter NAMM Show, for their headless guitar model, the Vader. At the 2016 Winter NAMM, Super NAMM Awards were won from Guitar Aficionado for their 70th anniversary K-series model, and from Guitar World for their 24-fret bolt-on Aries model. Notable artists Jason Becker has been a long time endorser of Carvin Guitars, and Kiesel offers three tribute models in his honor. The JB200C is based on the original DC200 models that Jason played, while the newer JB24 \\"Numbers\\" guitar is based on Jason's original Peavey custom model with the numbered fretboard markers. The JB100 entry level Jason Becker signature guitar was released in 2017. Allan Holdsworth was an endorser, and Kiesel has several models based on Holdsworth's designs, including headless and MIDI synth variants. Frank Gambale's model is a semi-hollow carved top, available with MIDI synth. Greg Howe's has 24-fret bolt-on signature models. Neil Zaza's signature is based on the Carved Top model line, featuring his preferred control layout. Craig Chaquico has a signature thinline acoustic/electric model. Lee McKinney of Born of Osiris has signature six and seven string models, based on the DC600 model line. Bassist Brian Bromberg has a series of basses based on a body of his design, while Roy Vogt has a signature 6 string model based on the Vanquish model. Chris Letchford of Scale the Summit has a headless multiscale signature series, with a \\"set through neck\\". Other endorsers include Anna Sentina, Johnny Hiland and Michael Hermes.

As a musicologist he was considered \\"the leading French pioneer in the field of early music, both in the way it should be performed and in respect for the original scores of 16th, 17th and 18th century composers.\\" His research and writings, especially his book The Secrets of Early Music, or the search for its interpretation (1964), is credited as the catalyst for the revived interest in French baroque music by the classical music world during the 1970s. He was named a Chevalier of the L√©gion d'honneur by the government of France. Life and career Born in Paris, Geoffroy-Dechaume studied at the Paris Conservatoire from 1923-1931 where he was a pupil of Eug√®ne Gigout (organ) and Georges Caussade (composition). From 1922-1937 he served as organist of Notre Dame de Pontoise and from 1937-1939 he taught on the faculty of the University of Caen Lower Normandy. He then took a position at the Conservatoire √† rayonnement r√©gional de Poitiers where he led a highly regarded early music group, the Collegium Musicae Antiquae. From 1962 until his retirement he was professor at the Schola Cantorum de Paris. Geoffroy-Dechaume was the resident harpsichordist at the Bath International Music Festival during the 1960s. The festival notably used a score he had prepared for a revival of Jean-Philippe Rameau's 1733 opera Hippolyte et Aricie. He also prepared scores for broadcasts by the BBC, performances at the Aix-en-Provence Festival and the English Bach Festivals, and for concerts given by the Orchestre National de France.

The church was built over the site of an ancient church titled San Pietro in Foro (St Peter of the Roman Forum). History A church was present at the site, which included the old Roman forum by 809, but it was rebuilt after a fire in 1174. In about 1583, Duke Ranuccio I Farnese had invited the Jesuits into the duchy, and ceded them the church. They razed the ancient structure and replaced it with the present church with construction spanning from 1585 and 1587. The belltower dates to the 17th century. In 1607, the Jesuits founded a seminary at this site. However, in 1768 the order was expelled from the duchy.Papal suppression of the Jesuit order occurred in 1773. While the Jesuits returned some decades after the Napoleonic wars, they remained briefly until 1848 at the church of San Pietro. Since 1893, San Pietro was made a parish church. In the early decades of the 1900 the church underwent further restoration work, including of the present fa√ßade.

The pixel value is computed as a convolution : p'_u=\\\\mathbf{d} \\\\ast G where \\\\mathbf{d} is the derivative kernel and G is the pixel values in a region of the image and \\\\ast is the operator that performs the convolution.  Sobel derivatives  The derivative kernels, known as the Sobel operator are defined as follows, for the u and v directions respectively: : p'_u = \\\\begin{bmatrix} +1 & +2 & +1 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ -1 & -2 & -1 \\\\end{bmatrix} * \\\\mathbf{G} \\\\quad \\\\mbox{and} \\\\quad p'_v= \\\\begin{bmatrix} +1 & 0 & -1 \\\\ +2 & 0 & -2 \\\\ +1 & 0 & -1 \\\\end{bmatrix} * \\\\mathbf{G} where * here denotes the 2-dimensional convolution operation. This operator is separable and can be decomposed as the products of an interpolation and a differentiation kernel, so that, p'_v, for an example can be written as : \\\\begin{bmatrix} +1 & 0 & -1 \\\\ +2 & 0 & -2 \\\\ +1 & 0 & -1 \\\\end{bmatrix} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1\\\\ 2\\\\ 1 \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\begin{bmatrix} +1 & 0 & -1 \\\\end{bmatrix} Farid and Simoncelli derivatives Farid and Simoncelli.H. Farid and E. P. Simoncelli, Differentiation of discrete multi-dimensional signals, IEEE Trans Image Processing, vol.13(4), pp. 496--508, Apr 2004.H. Farid and E. P. Simoncelli, Optimally Rotation-Equivariant Directional Derivative Kernels, Int'l Conf Computer Analysis of Images and Patterns, pp. 207--214, Sep 1997. propose to use a pair of kernels, one for interpolation and another for differentiation (compare to Sobel above). These kernels, of fixed sizes 5 x 5 and 7 x 7, are optimized so that the Fourier transform approximates their correct derivative relationship. In Matlab code the so called 5-tap filter is k = [0.030320 0.249724 0.439911 0.249724 0.030320]; d = [0.104550 0.292315 0.000000 -0.292315 -0.104550]; d2 = [0.232905 0.002668 -0.471147 0.002668 0.232905]; And the 7-tap filter is k = [ 0.004711 0.069321 0.245410 0.361117 0.245410 0.069321 0.004711]; d = [ 0.018708 0.125376 0.193091 0.000000 -0.193091 -0.125376 -0.018708]; d2 = [ 0.055336 0.137778 -0.056554 -0.273118 -0.056554 0.137778 0.055336]; As an example the first order derivatives can be computed in the following using Matlab in order to perform the convolution Iu = conv2(d, k, im, 'same'); % derivative vertically (wrt Y) Iv = conv2(k, d, im, 'same'); % derivative horizontally (wrt X) It is noted that Farid and Simoncelli have derived first derivative coefficients which are more accurate compared to the ones provided above. However, the latter are consistent with the second derivative interpolator and, therefore, are better to use if both the first and second derivatives are sought. In the opposite case, when only the first derivative is desired, the optimal first derivative coefficients should be employed; more details can be found in their paper.  Hast derivatives  Derivative filters based on arbitrary cubic splines was presented by Hast.A. Hast., \\"Simple filter design for first and second order derivatives by a double filtering approach\\", Pattern Recognition Letters, Vol. 42, no.1 June, pp. 65--71. 2014. He showed how both first and second order derivatives can be computed more correctly using cubic or trigonometric splines. Efficient derivative filters need to be of odd length so that the derivative is computed for the central pixel. However, any cubic filter is fitted over 4 sample points, giving a centre that falls between pixels. This is solved by a double filtering approach giving filters of size 7 x 7. The idea is to first filter by interpolation so that the interpolated value between pixels are obtained, whereafter the procedure is repeated using a derivative filters, where the centre value now falls on pixel centres. This can easily be proved by the associative law for convolution : p'_u=\\\\mathbf{d} \\\\ast (\\\\mathbf{k} \\\\ast G) = (\\\\mathbf{d} \\\\ast \\\\mathbf{k}) \\\\ast G Therefore the convolution kernel for computing the derivative \\\\mathbf{k_d} using an interpolating kernel \\\\mathbf{k} and a derivative kernel \\\\mathbf{d} becomes : \\\\mathbf{k_d}=\\\\mathbf{d} \\\\ast \\\\mathbf{k} Also keep in mind that convolution is commutative, so that the order of the two kernels does not matter and it is also possible to insert a second order derivative as well as a first order derivative kernel. These kernels are derived from the fact that any spline surface can be fitted over a square pixel region, compare to Bezier surfaces. Hast proves that such a surface can be performed as a separable convolution : p(u,v)=\\\\mathbf{u}^T MGM^T \\\\mathbf{v} = M^T \\\\mathbf{u} \\\\otimes \\\\mathbf{v}^T M \\\\ast G where M is the spline basis matrix, \\\\mathbf{u} and \\\\mathbf{v} are vectors containing the variables u and v, such as : \\\\mathbf{u}=[u^3, u^2, u,1]^T : \\\\mathbf{v}=[v^3, v^2, v,1]^T The convolution kernels can now be set to : \\\\mathbf{k}=\\\\mathbf{u}^T M = (M^T \\\\mathbf{v})^T :\\\\mathbf{d}=\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{u}^T}{\\\\partial u} M = \\\\left(M^T \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{v}}{\\\\partial v} \\\\right)^T : \\\\mathbf{d^2}=\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 \\\\mathbf{u}^T}{\\\\partial u^2}M = \\\\left(M^T \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 \\\\mathbf{v}}{\\\\partial v^2} \\\\right)^T The first order derivatives at the central pixel are hence computed as : D_u=\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{u}^T}{\\\\partial u}M \\\\ast \\\\mathbf{u}^T M G M^T \\\\mathbf{v}\\\\ast M^T \\\\mathbf{v}= \\\\mathbf{d} \\\\ast \\\\mathbf{k} \\\\otimes (\\\\mathbf{k} \\\\ast \\\\mathbf{k})^T \\\\ast G and : D_v=\\\\mathbf{u}^T M \\\\ast \\\\mathbf{u}^T M G M^T \\\\mathbf{v}\\\\ast M^T \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{v}}{\\\\partial v}= \\\\mathbf{k} \\\\ast\\\\mathbf{k} \\\\otimes (\\\\mathbf{d} \\\\ast \\\\mathbf{k})^T \\\\ast G Likewise, with the second order derivative kernels are : D^2_u=\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 \\\\mathbf{u}^T}{\\\\partial u^2}M \\\\ast \\\\mathbf{u}^T M G M^T \\\\mathbf{v}\\\\ast M^T \\\\mathbf{v}= \\\\mathbf{d^2} \\\\ast \\\\mathbf{k} \\\\otimes (\\\\mathbf{k} \\\\ast \\\\mathbf{k})^T \\\\ast G and : D^2_v=\\\\mathbf{u}^T M \\\\ast \\\\mathbf{u}^T M G M^T \\\\mathbf{v}\\\\ast M^T \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 \\\\mathbf{v}}{\\\\partial v^2} =\\\\mathbf{k} \\\\ast \\\\mathbf{k} \\\\otimes (\\\\mathbf{d^2} \\\\ast \\\\mathbf{k})^T \\\\ast G The cubic spline filter is evaluated in its centre u=v=0.5 and therefore : \\\\mathbf{u}=\\\\mathbf{v}=[(0.5)^3, (0.5)^2, 0.5, 1]^T=[0.125, 0.25, 0.5,1]^T Likewise the first order derivatives becomes : \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{u}(0.5)}{\\\\partial u}=\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{v}(0.5)}{\\\\partial v}=[3 \\\\cdot (0.5)^2, 2 \\\\cdot (0.5), 1, 0]^T = [0.75, 1,1,0] ^T And in a similar manner the second order derivatives are : \\\\frac{d^2 \\\\mathbf{u}(0.5)}{ u^2}=\\\\frac{d^2 \\\\mathbf{v}(0.5)}{d v^2}=[6 \\\\cdot (0.5), 2, 0, 0]^T=[3,2,0,0]^T Any cubic filter can be applied and used for computing the image derivates using the above equations, such as B√©zier, Hermite or B-splines. The example in below in Matlab use the Catmull-Rom spline to compute the derivatives M = [1,-3,3,-1; -1,4,-5,2; 0,1,0,-1; 0,0,2,0] * 0.5; u = [0.125;0.25;0.5;1]; up = [0.75;1;1;0]; d = up'*M; k = u'*M; Iu = conv2(conv(d,k), conv(k,k), im,'same'); % vertical derivative (wrt Y) Iv = conv2(conv(k,k), conv(d,k), im,'same'); % horizontal derivative (wrt X)  Other approaches  Steerable filters can be used for computing derivatives W.T.

Mariupol had come under attack multiple times in the past year in the course of the War in Donbass, including in May‚ÄìJune 2014, when the city was under the control of pro-Russian forces; and the September 2014 offensive. On 24 January 2015, the Mariupol city council and regional police said the city was subjected to indiscriminate rocket fire from the long-range Grad systems, killing at least 30 and injuring 128. The Ukrainian officials said the rebels and the Russian military were responsible. According to Ukrainian intelligence, the attack was ordered by full-time Russian military commanders. in 2018, the Bellingcat open-data investigative group revealed evidence that officers and equipment of Russian forces were directly involved in the attack. The rebels denied the attack, but their leader, Alexander Zakharchenko, had announced an offensive against Mariupol later that day. According to a spot report by the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine, the Grad and Uragan rockets originated from the areas controlled by the pro-Russian forces. United Nations political chief Jeffrey D. Feltman said the attacks \\"knowingly targeted civilians,\\" violated international humanitarian law, and could amount to war crimes. The attack on Mariupol came 11 days after the deadly Volnovakha bus attack, when a rocket strike targeted a government checkpoint in the town of Volnovakha, hitting a passenger bus which resulted in the death of 12 civilians. Government officials attributed the incident to the separatists, but the rebels denied carrying out the attack. Background Military and political events in Mariupol between 2014-2015 Mariupol and Battle of Debaltseve were high-stake arenas for pro-Russian and Ukrainian forces as both cities are vital transport hubs, described as a \\"gateway to a land-bridge\\" to Russian- annexed Crimea, and strategically crucial to the pro-Russian objective of opening up and linking areas under their control with a view to securing the entire Donetsk and Luhansk regions. On 22 January, pro-Russian rebels tried to attack Ukrainian positions on North-East of the city but failed. The next day, Alexander Zaharchenko vowed to fight until he reached the border of the Donetsk Oblast. Separatists reportedly began a tank offensive, and also conducted attacks near the west of the city. The village of Talakovka was reportedly shelled hard by separatists, but Ukrainian forces were \\"holding on\\". The shelling was confirmed by Andriy Lysenko, but said the separatists were still incapable of shelling the city itself because Ukrainian forces had not led them get close enough. Dmitry Tymchuk, a military blogger, reported on Facebook that a convoy of DPR tanks and APCs were advancing towards the city. January 24 events A charred civilian vehicle from Mariupol after the attack. Exhibition in Kyiv. On 24 January, a major escalation took place after a rocket attack killed many people. Mariupol city authorities said that a Grad rocket hit a residential area in the city, and killed 20 people. Video footage showed that cars, buildings, and apartment flats were in flames as a result of the attack. The attack appeared to come from a multiple rocket launcher. One resident told Agence France-Presse on the telephone that the rebels had managed to seize Mariupol Airport, although rebels made no comment about that alleged airport seizure. The airport is located some 20 kilometers behind the front line. The rebels denied any involvement in the attack. The rocket attacks came a day after the rebels rejected a peace deal and announced they were going on a multi-prong offensive against the government in Kyiv to vastly increase their territory. Despite rebel denials, Donetsk rebel leader Alexander Zakharchenko said that his forces had started an offensive on Mariupol, and rejected further talks with Kyiv; Zakharchenko said that \\"Today an offensive was launched on Mariupol. This will be the best possible monument to all our dead.\\" Zakharchenko also stated that it is a provocation as DPR militants do not have mentioned artillery systems and according to his sourced the shelling was conducted from Staryi Krym. The death count also rose to 27 people, with several more injured. Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk called for an urgent meeting at the UN Security Council. A Ukrainian military checkpoint was also hit in the attack, killing one soldier. The city council urged citizens of Mariupol not to panic and said that \\"all units are on fully battle-ready. Security measures in the city have been strengthened.\\" The General Secretary of NATO Jens Stoltenberg condemned the attack, urging Russia to stop supporting the rebels. President Petro Poroshenko considered the attack a \\"crime against humanity\\", and cancelled his trip to Saudi Arabia. He also vowed to deliver a \\"full victory\\" over the rebels. According to OSCE observers \\"Grad\\" and \\"Uragan\\" rockets were used in this attack, originating from villages Oktyabr (19 km NE) and Zaichenko (15 km NE), both controlled by separatist forces. Later, pro-Russian rebels said they were not going to storm Mariupol and the offensive was only to strengthen positions around the city. The next day, President Poroshenko vowed to calm the recent fighting in the strategic port city. Speaking at an emergency meeting at the Ukrainian Security council, he said that the Minsk Protocol signed on September 5th was the only solution to end the conflict. He said intercepted radio conservations prove that pro-Russian rebels were behind the attacks, but the conservation hadn't been confirmed independently yet. Russia denied involvement in the attack, saying it was a result of Ukrainian forces shelling residential areas indiscriminately. Petro Poroshenko said Ukrainian forces killed most of rebels involved in the shelling, and put the rebel casualties at 110. Six Grad missile launchers were also destroyed according to him, and that the SBU captured the artillery gun spotter back to Kyiv for questioning. Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) published a detailed timeline of the rocket attack. Aftermath On 27 January, Azov Battalion members started training outside Mariupol should a rebel attack occur. Two of its members were killed in an attack on a checkpoint near the city the next day. On 1 February, the villages of Talakovka and Pavlopol near Mariupol city were heavily shelled by pro- Russian rebels, according to Ukrainian forces. On 3 February, separatists reportedly tried to attack Mariupol, but according to Ukrainian forces they claimed they destroyed two enemy tanks and a group of insurgents near the city. On 4 February, Ukrainian SBU reported that they successfully completed a special operation to liquidate the detachment of Russian Army which conducted this attack. On 10 February, the National Guard and the Azov Battalion launched an offensive on the town of Novoazovsk and quickly managed to capture the towns of Shyrokyne, Pavlopil, Kominternovo and Oktyabyr. Ukrainian forces managed to push the separatists back to Sakhanka, where the rebels were fighting back. However, fighting continued in the area and by late April, Deutsche Welle reported that pro-Russian militants had set up positions in the centre of Shyrokyne. International reactions The attack was condemned in a public statement by the High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Federica Mogherini. The condemnation by the United Nations Security Council was vetoed by Russia on the ground that the condemnation sought to blame Alexander Zakharchenko's announcement of beginning of the attack on Mariupol as being irresponsible and to condemn separatist forces who, according to Russia, are \\"self-defense forces\\". The attack and \\"provocative statements by self-defense leaders\\" were eventually condemned by UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. The attack was also condemned by NATO.

Life Makeblijde was born to a patrician family in Poperinge, County of Flanders, on 24 March 1565.S. S. Hoogerhuis, \\"Makeblijde, Lodewijk\\", De Nederlandse en Vlaamse auteurs van middeleeuwen tot heden met inbegrip van de Friese auteurs, edited by G.J. van Bork & P.J. Verkruijsse (Weesp, 1985), 368‚Äì69. His father, Lodewijk senior, was to be mayor of the town from 1571 to 1600.L. Loosen, S.J., (ed.), Lodewijk Makeblijde (1565‚Äì1630). Hymnen en gezangen (Zwolle, 1964), pp. 3‚Äì44 =Education= Lodewijk junior studied at the Jesuit college in St Omer (1579‚Äì1584), going on to study philosophy at the Jesuit house of studies (\\"Anchin College\\") in Douai (1584‚Äì1586), without matriculating at the University. In 1586 he applied to Francis Coster to be admitted to the Society of Jesus, and he started the novitiate at Tournai on 4 October 1586. During his novitiate, under novice master Jan van den Berg (Latinized \\"Bargius\\"), Makeblijde would have been expected to go through the Spiritual Exercises of Ignatius of Loyola thoroughly, to meditate for one hour each day, and to experience practical work in the hospitals, infirmaries, catechism classes and kitchens attached to Jesuit houses. In 1587 Makeblijde suffered a hernia that was not cured until 1593. On 5 October 1588 he made his vows as a member of the order, and in 1589 he began teaching at the Jesuit college in Bruges, being transferred to Ypres the following year. He taught at Ypres from 1590 to 1595, receiving the lower orders from Petrus Simons, bishop of Ypres, in 1593. In 1595 he was sent to the Jesuit house of studies in Leuven to study theology, again without matriculating at the university. He was taught dogmatic theology by Leonard Lessius and exegesis by Martin Del Rio and Cornelius a Lapide. Fellow students in Leuven were Heribert Rosweyde and Jan van Gouda. His ordinations as subdeacon (May 1597), deacon (September 1597) and priest (December 1597) were by Mathias Hovius, Archbishop of Mechelen. =Teacher and catechist= In 1597 his first work was published in Leuven by Jan Maes: Cort onderwijs van acht oeffeninghen (Short instruction of eight exercises), a collection of prayers and teachings for the young. He preached in Poperinge at Christmas 1599 and again in 1609, and dedicated his Berch (1618) to the magistrates of the town. In 1600 he was sent to Bergues (now in France) as rector of the new Jesuit school that was being established there with the help of the town council, the local Benedictine abbot and the bishop of Ypres. The college formally opened in 1601, with a Jesuit community of six priests, two scholastics and four brothers. During his time as rector at Bergues, Makeblijde regularly travelled to Dunkirk on Sundays to preach. In 1604 Makeblijde became rector of the Jesuit college in Ypres. He took his final vows in Lille on 22 September 1605. From 1605 to 1607 he was attached to the Jesuit house in Antwerp, where Carolus Scribani was rector, and the theology professors were his Leuven classmates Heribertus Rosweyde and Jan van Gouda. In Antwerp Makeblijde was not involved with the school, but with preaching. He had a reputation for being able to explain things clearly to children, and was involved in the production of the Mechelen Catechism (published in Antwerp by Joachim Trognaesius in 1609). =Missionary= From 1611 to 1630 he worked on the Holland Mission, based in Delft where there was a clandestine church in the brewery De drie Haringhen. His catechism classes had to be stopped in 1617, and the schout (sheriff) of Delft raided his secret evening sermons five times that year, but without capturing Makeblijde. In June 1619 he was arrested, but was ransomed for 600 guilders. In 1621 the head of the Jesuit mission in Holland, Marcus van den Tempel, was captured by the magistrates of Leiden and expelled from the Republic. Makeblijde replaced him as head of the Mission just as the work was made harder by new laws against Jesuit missioners. The States General of the United Provinces passed a law on 26 February 1622, proclaimed in Delft on 13 March, giving Jesuits six days to leave the Republic. Makeblijde went into hiding. The worst period of persecution, by schout Jan Vockestaert, ran from 1621 to 1629. Makeblijde himself was replaced as head of the Mission in 1629, due to ill health caused by gall stones. He died at Voorschoten in Holland on 17 August 1630. Commemoration From 1955 to 2008 there was a secondary school in Rijswijk named the Lodewijk Makeblijde College (since amalgamated to St Stanislas College, Delft).

The name of the installation is taken from a color of horse known as a blue roan, though the live animal color is actually closer to gray. The horse sculptures were created and set up by artist Jim Dolan of Belgrade, Montana, who previously had created other complex outdoor sculptures over the past 30 years, including a herd of elk placed upon the lawn of a bank in Bozeman, and a fly fisherman sculpture in Ennis. He also donated four of his sculptures at Montana State University (MSU), and installed a flock of geese in the terminal of Bozeman Yellowstone International Airport. Background Dolan spent 15 months and his own money to create, transport and install the horses as a gift to the people of Montana. When he moved to Montana from California in 1966, he intended to live there permanently and be an asset to the state: \\"I always knew that someday I‚Äôd have a specific project ... I decided [in 2013], on my 64th birthday, this is what I would do.\\" The horse sculptures were installed on Kamp Hill on land donated by Dean Folkvord of Wheat Montana on a patch of unfenced acreage that is not suitable for farming. Folkvord came up with the idea of using Kamp Hill when Dolan stopped into the Wheat Montana Bakery for coffee and expressed frustration to Folkvord about his difficulties finding an appropriate site for installing the horses he was creating. Development and Installation Bleu horses installation as seen from Highway 287 The sculptures are realistic enough to appear live from a distance, but are intended to be somewhat \\"impressionistic.\\" To emphasize the elegance of the horse, the legs of the horse sculptures are one-third longer than those of real horses, and they average high at the withers. Dolan said, \\"They're symbols of horses and what horses mean to Montanans. But at first sight, I want people to believe they are real horses, just for a second.\\" They are posed in a variety of realistic positions from foals suckling mother's milk, to alert steeds, to supine equines. According to Dolan, \\"I tried to place the horses the way I see the horses living in their natural environment according to their nature.\\" Twelve of the horses have their heads placed on ball bearings so they are able to move and one can move its head and neck. Each horse is painted blue with accents of black and white to give their forms a sense of depth. They have manes and tails made of polyester rope that has been unraveled and attached so it moves realistically in the wind. The 4,000 feet of rope needed for the horses was unraveled by hand by the employees at Reach, Inc., a supported workplace for people with developmental disabilities. Dolan said, \\"They really enjoyed doing it, and when I told them what the ropes were for, they felt like they were involved in something bigger than just the job. So those people, they‚Äôre part of this, too.‚Äù The horses were permanently placed on the land by having long stakes welded to their hooves and placed into holes created with a jackhammer. A tractor was used to place each sculpture in its precise location. In December 2013, three of the sculptures were stolen off the hill but recovered near Townsend a day later. People driving along U.S. 287 can take a dirt road that goes around the back of the herd to view them at closer range. To view the horses from the highway, cars can pull over to the shoulder of the road at the bottom of the hill, and it is possible to walk along the highway to a vantage point at a former pulloff midway up the hill that is now closed to parking.

Plot  The movie starts off with a flashback that's being narrated by Urvil (Tanuj Virwani). It is the flashback and a series of events from his past that has defined his today. The flashback starts off with a fashion show organised by his event management agency in Phuket, Thailand. And after completing the event successfully, Urvil and his colleagues go drinking to celebrate. It is here that his friends challenge him to speak to a rank stranger (Sunny Leone) for a few thousand rupees. An attempt to win the bet gets him introduced to the stranger who, in turn, introduces herself as Celina. What follows after that, is unlimited liquor drinking by the two of them, which ultimately lands them up in bed together. But, the very next day, when Urvil gets up, he finds out that Celina has already left the room, without leaving any details of her whereabouts. And when Urvil comes back to his home in Pune, he is welcomed by his beautiful and dutiful wife Simran (Nyra Banerjee). Things are absolutely smooth between the couple, until one day Urvil accidentally spots Celina in the same mall wherein he has gone for shopping with his wife Simran. That very sight of Celina freshens up his 'one night stand' with her, which, in turn, gets translated into his desperation to meet her again. Thereafter begins his unending quest to hunt down Celina from the length and the breadth of the world. Amidst all this, Urvil gets extremely busy with his company's big- budget event of a product launch. It is here where he gets introduced to his rich client Adhiraj Kapoor (Khalid Siddiqui) and his family, which takes the daylights out of Urvil.

Urvil loses interest in his job and wife and stalks Celina/ Ambar. His colleague David (Ninad Kamat) advises him to forget Celina in order to save his marriage but he ignores his advice. Urvil tails Ambar continuously. Being fed up, she asks him to leave her alone and forget whatever happened between them as 'one night stand' but he refuses to do so and Urvil haunts him so much that he reaches their home and embarrasses Ambar. He rapes Simran, uttering Celina's name. She picks up a fight with him and on the pretext of dropping him to his office, she races their car in the busy street asking Urvil to confess as to who is Celina and about their affair. He is terrified due to the rashly driven speeding car and admits to Simran about the illegitimate affair with Celina. She drops him on the road-side and tells him that it's all over between them. He returns home and begs her to pardon him for his folly but Simran is firm in refusing. Ultimately, Ambar calls Urvil to a spot on the highway to inform him that he should forget whatever happened between them and leave her alone. Urvil blames her for his marriage turmoil but she retorts that he was himself responsible. When Urvil threatens her that he would reveal the secret to Adhiraj, she informs him that she would do so herself irrespective of the consequence. She leaves him alone brooding about his future.

The airport features a asphalt runway aligned 04/22. The airport is owned by Tronrud Engineering and is part of Eggemoen Aviation & Technology Park. The airport is situated midway between H√∏nefoss and Jevnaker. Construction of the airport commenced by Luftwaffe in 1943 and opened in September 1944. Amongst the largest airports in the country, it never filled its role as a military transit airport. During the Second World War it variously was home to Junkers Ju 88, Ju 87, Ju 52 and Messerschmitt Bf 109 aircraft. Eggemoen's largest task was as a central facility after the war for disposal and reuse of German aircraft. From 1946 to 1952 the airport was home to √òstlandske Flyselskap. It featured the Royal Norwegian Air Force's pilot school from 1951 to 1952. Since it has only seen negligible military use. Ringerike Municipality bought the airport in 1986. It was proposed used as the main general aviation airport for Eastern Norway, but a municipal referendum canceled the plans. Tronrud bought the airport in 2000 and it reopened in 2013 with the runway extended to its original length. History =Second World War= The Norwegian Army Air Service started in 1938 to look into suitable sites for a second airport in Eastern Norway, which could supplement Kjeller Airport. In addition to what would become Haslemoen Airport, it considered three sites in Ringerike: Hensmoen, Marig√•rdsmoen and Veme. Despite the lack of an airport, there was already an aviation club, Ringerike Flyklubb, based at Hvalsmoen.√òstlund: 288 They encouraged the military to consider building an airport at Eggemoen. However, the plans did not come any further before the German invasion of Norway set in on 9 April 1940.√òstlund: 289 Luftwaffe soon took an interest in the airport plans and planning started in 1941. However, construction did not commence before 1943. A forest area was expropriated from Egge Farm and 200 Norwegians were hired to cut down the forest. Under the command of Erwin Keller, further construction was carried out by a combination of Organisation Todt, prisoners of war and Norwegian contractors.√òstlund: 290 The plan for construction was extensive and was planned as one of the largest airports in Norway.Hafsten: 315 This included a runway, a dummy runway on the other side of the Randsfjorden Line, a taxiway and hardened aircraft shelters, among others.√òstlund: 291 The airport was completed in September 1944, by which time it had received an runway. It also had landing lights and an instrument landing system, as well as a Lorenz radar.√òstlund: 292 The air base was activated on 29 September 1944 with the arrival of the first aircraft to be stationed there. This was the 1. Staffel of Fernaufklarungsgeschwader 120 which had been at V√¶rnes Air Station. Initially there were four Junkers Ju 88s, later increasing to six. The squadron carried out reconnaissance. It was relocated to Lista Air Station on 25 December, the same day 20. Staffel of Transportgrupfe 20 was allocated to Eggemoen. It operated twelve Junkers Ju 52 transporters and remained at Eggemoen until the end of the war on 8 May 1945. For a short period in 1945 there was also a squadron of Messerschmitt Bf 109s stationed at Eggemoen. The airport was also used for stop-overs for a wide variety of German aircraft, typically for refueling.√òstlund: 293 The airport's intended use was as a stop- over for large numbers of aircraft in transit. This happened only once, in late 1944, when ninety Junkers Ju 87 Stukas refueled at Eggemoen. During early 1945 the Wehrmacht designated Eggemoen as a site to fly out senior officials should Germany surrender. Air defenses were installed, with 88 mm guns installed at V√•g√•rd and Gundersby, as well as smaller guns at the airfield itself. The Gundersby gun was dismounted and sent elsewhere. A wooden dummy was placed in its place, and Allied intelligence never discovered this. Following the surrender on 8 May 1945, Eggemoen became a major transit station for Luftwaffe aircraft. In the airport's busiest period ever, it was the site for reallocation of aircraft. Some were to be retained in Norway and used by the Royal Norwegian Air Force, others sent to Germany for destruction and some allocated to the Royal Air Force.√òstlund: 295 =Norwegian Armed Forces operations= After the aftermath died out, there was little military activity at Eggemoen. The airfield was kept in use, with √òstlandske Flyselskap establishing a base there in 1946. They remained there until moving to Fornebu in 1952. Activities were mostly centered on air taxi and a pilot school. The Royal Norwegian Air Force moved its pilot school to Eggemoen in 1951. The training was contracted to Wider√∏e, who operated the air force's aircraft. This was a short-term role for the airport, as the school was moved to V√¶rnes on 3 June 1952.Arheim: 235 Eggemoen Base was expanded significantly from 1952 to 1954, and became the home for Engineering Company.Torbl√•: 159 This role was kept until 1963, after which it became used for engineering training.Torbl√•: 164 The airfield was little used, and surrounding it were built a series of training fields.Torbl√•: 200 A 1988 commission considered Eggemoen as a potential site for a new main air station for fighter aircraft in Eastern Norway. Although it had sufficient area for construction, an air station would have to be built on both sides of the Randsfjorden Line. The proximity to H√∏nefoss and Jevnaker would incur high noise pollution. Investments would be high as the entire runway would have to be rotated ten degrees.Ministry of Defence: 30 =Civilian revival= Due to its proximity to Oslo, north- northeast of the capital, Eggemoen was considered as a possible location of a new airport.Ministry of Transport and Communication: 85 A 1970 commission evaluated Eggemoen and found that it had insufficient area for Norway's main airport and that it had too many hills around it to meet runway safety standards.Ministry of Transport and Communication: 88 Eggemoen was the most expensive of the seven alternatives,Ministry of Transport and Communication: 104 in part caused by the high investments needed to ground transport.Ministry of Transport and Communication: 100 and also had the smallest surrounding communities around it, complicating the settlement of airport workers.Ministry of Transport and Communication: 114 This also reflected in its general isolation from the population centers in Eastern Norway.Ministry of Transport and Communication: 121 The airport was found to be advantageous in terms of air corridors,Ministry of Transport and Communication: 92 and low impact of noise pollution.Ministry of Transport and Communication: 110 The municipality bought part of the runway in 1986 and established a civilian operation of the airport. he airport was shrunk by placing an asphalt airfield measuring on the northern part of the concrete runway. By the 1990s the only operators left at the airfield were the aviation clubs. With Gardermoen having been selected as the new main airport and the decision being made to close down Fornebu, a political debate arose in the early 1990s of where the general aviation airport for Eastern Norway should be located. The government proposed in 1994 that three airports share this role, Kjeller, Eggemoen and Rygge. Within two years Eggemoen was proposed as the main general aviation airport for Eastern Norway. State funding of NOK 50 million was offered. Traffic was estimated to increase from 6,000 aircraft movements per year to 40,000 in 1999 and 51,000 in 2010. A unanimous Jevnaker Municipal Council opposed the plans, as they would receive most of the noise pollution. With a vote 22 against 21, Ringerike Municipal Council voted in favor of a referendum concerning the airport. Held on 6 March 1996, tt had a turnout of 36 percent, of which 66.2 percent voted against the proposal for Eggemoen. This was confirmed in Ringerike Municipal Council, where with one decisive vote the approval was discarded. Tronrud Engineering bought the airfield in two transaction, in 2000 and 2005, along with the rest of Eggemoen Base. Work started on converting the facility to an industrial park centered on the airfield. Although civilian aviation authorities proposed an runway, instead the full length of . The aerodrome was eventually closed in 2009 for a complete renovation. Tronrud Engineering hoped that the investments would allow aerospace industries to relocate to Eggemoen. Air Service Vamdrup, a provider of air maintenance, established its Norwegian division at Eggemoen in May 2014. Facilities H√∏nefoss Airport, Eggemoen is situated at Eggemoen, located east of H√∏nefoss and west of Jevnaker. The airfield is part of Eggemoen Aviation & Technology Park, which is owned by Tronrud Engineering. The aerodrome features an asphalt runway measuring , aligned 04/22. It is limited to aircraft smaller than a maximum take-off weight of , carrying less than ten passengers and is limited to 15,200 aircraft movements per year.

He is considered a pioneer of Dutch sports journalism. Biography He was a versatile athlete; He did speed skating, football and billiards. His greatest passion, however, was cycling. Up to the age of 40 he was an employee at the Nederlandse Spoorwegen, he wrote sports articles for a number of daily and weekly newspapers, but from the turn of the century he spent his spare time writing about the sports that he exerted. From the early 1920s he worked full-time as a journalist and was the Hague sports correspondent for several magazines and newspapers, including \\"Sports\\", \\"Sports World\\", \\"Sporty\\" and \\"Panorama\\", for many years. His articles were of a biting style. In 1928, he wrote the book \\"De Wielersport begint\\" (The Cycling Begins), which portrays the beginnings of racing in the Netherlands. In the following year he wrote \\"Te midden der kampioenen\\" (Among the Champions) about the multiple world champion Piet Moeskops and his special discipline Sprint (cycling). In 1941 he published the Sports Psychology works \\"Werk Mysterieuze Krachten in de Sport\\" (Mysterious Forces at Work in Sport). He noted that \\"the muscles that provide the power, have no value without the will of the spirit\\". the latter two books are considered classics of cycling literature and are still widely read today. It was due to Van den Bergh's initiative, that in 1936 the first four-piece Dutch national team appeared at the 1936 Tour de France. They were helped by having the support of his Flemish colleague Karel Van Wijnendaele, and the failure of the Italian driver because of the Second Italo-Abyssinian War. As the driver Theo Middelkamp said to Van den Bergh: \\"But Joris, I have never seen a mountain.\\" Mahi started and won a heavy mountain stage and finished 23rd overall. Van den Bergh himself however didn't go to France, but instead focused on reporting the event from home, on the basis of articles in other Belgian newspapers, telex and telephone conversations with the racers. Van den Bergh went to the 1939 Tour de France, 1948 Tour de France and 1949 Tour de France acting as the team leader at the tours. In 1939 he was driven there by his Chauffeur. Van den Bergh's real love however was track cycling, and his affinity and knowledge of road cycling were significantly lower. From this period dates the anecdote that Van den Bergh thought cyclists have it easier than their companions in the hot, narrow cars where they couldn't feel the cooling wind. Also he fell victim to the miscalculation, that the Italian racer Fausto Coppi was nothing more than \\"een mannetje met een tip bristle\\" (\\"a male with a chicken breast\\"). In the 1930s, Van den Bergh took the view that a Europe under German leadership was \\"not a bad idea\\" which caused bad blood among his colleagues. Also in August 1942 he took part in the NSB a meeting about Nazi occupation of the Netherlands. Sports journalists gathered in ValkenburgAdriaan Venema: \\"Schrijvers, uitgevers-en hun collaboratie. Part 4: Uitgevers en boekhandelaren \\". Amsterdam 1992 p. 289 (Dutch) and praised this meeting in the magazine \\"De Nederlandsche Journalist\\" (The Dutch Journalist) as a \\"historic moment\\". His enthusiasm was based on a speech by the Secretary of State for education and arts, , which had highlighted the importance of sports journalism. In 1944 however he published the brochure \\"De post in de vloeiweide\\" (The post in the rolling meadow). In it he described the attack by \\"rogue of the SS\\" on a radio station for Dutch resistance near Breda, where nine Dutch people including one child were killed, and eight more people were executed the next day. Van den Bergh, knew some of the people that were killed, and made it no secret that he now hated the Germans.

Goddess History Poleramma Boundary protector as god personified as feminine. The principal deity is Poleramman, and her name may vary according to the regional emphasis. Poleramma is worshiped as a village guardian goddess to protect the village. The shrine is usually kept outside the village, quite frequently on the banks of the irrigation tank. Sometimes the shrine has a makeshift nature and appears crudely built with mud and stones. Although Poleramma does not enjoy the permanent basis of temple premises, there is nothing to doubt bhaktas devotion towards Mother. In the rural setting Goddess Poleramma is considered the goddess of smallpox, more in the nature of Mother Muthu Mariamman of Tamil Nadu. But then again, Mother also oversees cattle disease, drought, and general health welfare. At community festivals of goddess goat is killed and eaten.

On the first day the pot is taken from the tree and carried throughout the village which is accompanied by the beating of drums. When it is carried past each house the people come out and bow in worship before it. The aadi calls upon the elders to witness, calling each one by name and announces the various vows that have been made to Poleramma. Thereafter a goat is taken for blessing, killed and eaten later at a communal meal. Once again similar procession takes place and the pot is carried around the village, food being collected at each house. The temple is also purified with various ceremonies. The stone image is bathed and some offerings are placed before her. The procession now goes to the water where the royal staff and the snake's hood s have been kept in water over night. These are taken and carried to the temple after a goat has been offered. After placing all this beside Poleramma in the temple, the ceremonies of the first day is complete. On the second day there are still some more processions about the village and the food is offered in front of the house of another shepherd. On the third day the procession starts earlier and more food is collected. After some rituals the merry-making takes place. The villagers bring their decorated carts and oxen and form a procession to go around the temple. After the procession of carts, the people bring sheep, goats, and chickens which are offered to Poleramma for blessing. This ends the ceremonies of the third day. The fourth day is the greatest day of the festival. It has the most revolting features of any part of the ceremonies. A huge heap of boiled cholam, kaffir corn, is poured out before the goddess and the animal to be killed is brought. Several rituals are performed after this. When Poleramma's worship is over, a goat is offered to Potu Razu, and some of the food is poured before him. Prayers are offered to him in order to guard the village and this brings the ceremonies to an end.

During his journalistic career, he served as editor of The Sun News-Pictorial, and editor-in-chief of The Herald and Weekly Times and Queensland Newspapers. From 1992 to 2015, he was the official historian of the Australian Olympic Committee.  Early life  Gordon was born 9 November 1925 to Harry Gordon, a dockworker, and his wife, Marjorie. As a child, he was taught to tap dance by his mother and to box by his father. He was educated at Elwood Primary School and Melbourne High School, a selective all-boys school. He was a high school middleweight boxing champion.  Career  = Journalism = Gordon began his journalistic career as a teenager, working as a copyboy for The Daily Telegraph when he was 16. He began working at The Sun News-Pictorial in 1949 as a general reporter. In 1950, at the age of 24, he was sent abroad to cover the Korean War from the front-line. In addition to his own newspaper, his war reports were published in the Adelaide Advertiser, The West Australian and The Courier-Mail. Shocked by the edits made to his reports by the United States' censorship teams, he developed a system of flying to Japan when he had a particularly good story, and dictating his report to a friend who would take a copy to the AAP-Reuters office in Tokyo for direct transmission to Australia; this avoided the reports being censored. In 1968, he was appointed Editor of The Sun News-Pictorial. He used his newspaper to head a campaign titled 'Declare War on 1034' to reduce car-related fatalities; the number is a reference to the number of road deaths in Victoria in 1969. The campaign was successful and in 1970 the state government introduced a mandatory seatbelt law requiring car users to wear seatbelts; this was the first such law in the world. He was Chairman of the Australian Associated Press in the 1980s. = Olympic Games = As a journalist, he covered every Olympic Games between 1952 and 2012: his first Olympics being the Helsinki Games, and his last the London Games. In 1992, he was appointed the official historian of the Australian Olympic Committee. He wrote a history of Australia's participation in the Olympics. It was titled Australia and the Olympic Games and it was published in 1994. In 2003, he authored The Time of Our Lives: Inside the Sydney Olympics : Australia and the Olympic Games 1994‚Äì2002 and in 2014 From Athens With Pride: The Official History of the Australian Olympic Movement, 1894 to 2014. Gordon played a major role in the naming of streets around the 1956 Melbourne and 2000 Sydney Olympic precincts. The streets were named to honour significant Olympic athletes.  Later life  He was a member of the Australian Football Hall of Fame selection committee from 1996 to 2008. He was hospitalised two weeks before his death because of respiratory issues. He died in January 2015, aged 89.  Personal life  Gordon married Dorothy Scott in 1951. Together, they had three children; Sally, Michael and John, who all followed Harry into the media (Michael into journalism, John as a news and sports cameraman, and Sally as make-up artist for film and television).

Oberholzer is celebrating his 60th birthday with his family (NB in some settings it is his 50th birthday being celebrated). Preparations are well under way. Anna, Oberholzer's daughter, is rehearsing a song written especially for the occasion with Kati, the household cook. Aunt Berta and her husband Fritz arrive first. Anna and Kati have scarcely restarted their rehearsal when the arrival of Aunt Paula with Uncle Gustav and Aunt Lisa with Uncle Heinrich disturbs them again. After the greetings, Anna and Kati want to perform their song, but another arrival interrupts them, that of Oberholzer's brother Alexander, the black sheep of the family, with his wife Iduna. Alexander has become the director of a travelling circus and calls himself Obolski; he has much with which to regale. His wife Iduna tells of her father's talents as a clown. In a dream scene, Anna's aunts appear as the circus's big cats in an arena. The uncles, acting as clowns, make the audience laugh. Iduna rides a horse and Anna swings on a trapeze. Anna decides to run away with the circus. Robert cannot understand the actions of his beloved, but this does not change her mind. The men of the party dance around Iduna and shower her with compliments. Iduna confides in Anna that behind the glamour of the circus there is also a darker side, and that she craves a more permanent existence. Anna recognises that she is perhaps not made for the travelling life. Her father is so delighted with her change of mind that he finally gives his approval for her engagement to Robert.  Musical highlights  Das Feuerwerk was Paul Burkhard's most successful work. The song O mein Papa (Oh my father) became particularly famous; an English-language version by Eddie Fisher \\"Oh! My Pa-Pa\\" made it to Number One in the US in 1954. Further well-known songs were *\\"Ich hab‚Äò ein kleines s√ºsses Pony\\" (\\"I have a sweet little pony\\") *\\"Ich sag‚Äò es gern durch die Blume\\" (\\"I'm happy to say it among the flowers\\") *\\"Ein Leben lang verliebt\\" (\\"A lifetime in love\\") *\\"Die Welt ist gross und weit\\" (\\"The world is great and wide\\") The work, which was published under the genre of musical comedy, is reminiscent both in music and subject of American musicals and therefore marks a departure from the traditional operetta in German theatre entertainment of the 1950s. Film adaptations Director Kurt Hoffmann filmed the musical comedy in 1954 with Lilli Palmer, Romy Schneider, Karl Sch√∂nb√∂ck and Claus Biederstaedt in the main roles.

The escalation archetype is common for situations of non-cooperative games where each player can make own decisions and these decisions lead to the outcome for the player. However, when both player try to maximize their output (at the expense of the other one) they can get into a loop where each player will try harder and harder to surpass the opponent. While it can have favourable consequences it can also lead to self-destructive behaviour.  Structure  = Elements of archetype = Escalation archetype system can be described using causal loop diagrams which may consist of balancing and reinforcing loops.  Balancing loop  Balancing loop is a structure representing negative feedback process. In such a structure, a change in system leads to actions that usually eliminate the effect of that change which means that the system tends to remain stable in time.  Reinforcing loop  Balancing loop is a structure representing positive feedback process. This reinforcing feedback causes that even a small change in the system can lead to huge disturbances, e.g. variable A is increased which leads to an increase of variable B which leads to another increase of A and so there might be an exponential growth over time. = Escalation archetype as balancing loops = The image below shows escalation archetype as two balancing loops. When X makes an action, it leads to a change in results of X relative to results of Y. Y then makes action to equalize the situation and the result again changes the balance and induces another action by X. As this repeats actions done by X and Y are bigger and bigger to keep up with other's actions and results. Escalation archetype as two balancing loops displayed as causal loop diagram = Escalation archetype as reinforcing loop = The causal loop diagram below shows escalation archetype as a single reinforcing loop. It can be read simply as that more action done by X creates bigger results of action done by X. The bigger results of X, the bigger difference between X and Y results. The bigger difference means more action by Y and more action by Y leads to bigger result of Y. The bigger result of Y leads to a smaller difference between X and Y, but the smaller is this difference, the bigger will be the action of X and it starts all over again. Escalation archetype as one reinforcing loop displayed as causal loop diagram The image below simplifies reinforcing loop and shows general idea of what happens. Increased activity of X leads to an increase of threat for Y which leads to an increased activity by Y. Increased activity by Y leads to increased threat for X which creates another potential for activity of X to grow. Escalation archetype simplified as one simple reinforcing loop displayed as causal loop diagram  Examples  = Arms race = A well known example of escalation archetype is the arms race. The idea is that in the arms race two (or more) parties are competing to have the strongest army and weapons. An example is the race in producing nuclear weapons by the United States and the Soviet Union that was an important factor in the Cold War. Over the time, each party can get temporarily a slight advantage, but then the other one produces or obtains in other way more weapons and gets the advantage on its side, temporarily. In the end, both parties have great military power that is very threatening not only to them but also to non-aligned parties. = Picking apples in an orchard = The escalation archetype can turn up in situations like picking apples in an orchard. Imagine a big apple orchard with a wealthy crop. An owner of such plantation cannot pick the whole harvest himself because there are simply too many trees. Therefore, he employs gatherers to do the work for him. He tries to figure a way how to measure the work they do so that he can reward them fairly. As he is suspicious that workers would work slowly he is hesitant to link the wage only to hours worked and he comes up with an idea. He divides workers into two groups and declares that the group which will harvest more apples will get a bonus to their regular wage. Both groups start harvesting apples with passion and energy. First group X collects a pallet a little bit sooner than the second group Y. Therefore, the Y group motivates those who were a little bit slacking to increase their pace. Now Y is a little bit better so they not only catch up but even finish the second load before X group. The X comes with an idea that they should assign roles to their members ‚Äì some will pick apples from the upper part of trees using ladders while some will collect those that are in the lower part of trees, other will load packs and one person will organise the work and help where necessary. This advantage enables X group to outrun the other again. While Y adapts the model of X, they make some changes and tweaks and soon they are the leading party. This improving of processes continues in several iterations until both parties are exceptionally effective in harvesting apples on the orchard. The owner can be really happy with the situation as containers are quickly being loaded with apples. Should everything continue this way, the orchard could be harvested in few hours with group X beating the group Y by a tenth of a percent. He could reward only the winning team or both teams because they were almost equally hardworking. However, due to the fact that one group was always a little bit behind, the situation in the middle of day is bad for one of the groups which is slightly behind, let's say it is group Y. Now, they can continue working like up to that moment and they would finish second with a loss of a tenth of a percent. Or they can come up with another idea that would enable them to increase their production output. They have an idea that harvesting topmost apples is slower that harvesting the rest of them. Because of that they decide to skip these apples and only collect the others. This way, the situation escalated into a trouble. While Y could win the competition now, there will be considerable amount of apples left on trees. Or if both groups are instructed not to leave a single apple in the orchard they will have to stay much longer to finish these apples thus the owner will have higher costs for their wage. Of course the owner could set a condition that none team could leave a tree that until it is fully harvested. That would help in some way to break the escalation archetype unless workers realize they are not punished for some other undesirable behaviour, for example being careless of tree condition after the harvest. As can be seen in this example, the escalation archetype might bring positive results (faster harvesting) but it is necessary to monitor behaviour of the affected system to ensure long-term prosperity. = The attention fight = To avoid naming in this example of escalation archetype occurrence, behaviour of imaginary persons Amy, Betty, Cecile and Danielle is described. Amy, Betty, Cecile and Danielle want to become famous celebrities with a lot of money, loving husband and amazing children. They already have many friends and everybody in the town knows each one of them. They all work hard to be best in their field of expertise and soon they are known to the whole country. They know of each other and try to work harder to become more famous than each other. This is when escalation archetype comes into play. They become the most famous celebrities in the country and each one of them realizes that to draw more attention than others they need to be unique and very special. As Amy starts to work even harder than before Betty notices that Amy's fame is growing more than hers and starts to work harder than Amy. This is noted by Cecile and she does what must be done - starts working more than anyone else. But there is also Danielle whose ambitions are not even slightly smaller, she wants to be the most famous celebrity and so she starts working even harder than anyone else. As Amy notices her effort is not sufficient, she does what is obvious - starts to work more than she was. Now this cycle could repeat continuously until Amy, Betty, Cecile or Danielle dies of overwork. In the meanwhile some of them could start taking drugs with the presumption that it could boost their productivity and ability to concentrate or with the aim to get rid of depressions from working all the time. Another solution presumed by them as feasible would be some way of elimination the opponents - by false accusation or by pointing to their faults. Or if they found it impossible to be better by simply working more, they could try to figure out some way how to attract attention by qualitative change instead of quantitative. This way Amy could say something shocking in TV. The issue is that due to escalation archetype being in place unfortunately. Betty could simply follow by saying something even more shocking or controversial. Then, Cecile would feel threatened and so she will come up with an idea that she could make controversial photographs. Then Danielle will try to surpass everyone and will do some action that will attract attention of media and public. And they would escalate this to extreme situation (as the behaviour can develop exponentially). While at the beginning the competitiveness was beneficial for both Amy, Betty, Cecile, Danielle and public, in the long term many issues raised. What could be a meaningful solution for these ladies? They could have set some limits themselves in their minds, for example how much time they are willing to work to achieve their desire to be a famous celebrity and what is alright to do and what is not. If they are not able to do so, there has to be some mechanism from outside to stop them - e.g. family or friend giving them an advice, as it would be difficult to set legal boundaries in this area. = Competing children = Tendency of parents to compare their children creates nourishing environment for escalation archetype. Parents tend to compare their kids with other children and among own kids. This creates pressure on children as they are expected to perform well. Imagine a family with two kids named, for example, Lisa and Bartolomeo. Their parents are very much children-focused and hope their kids will get proper educations and live what they consider successful lives. They invest significant portions of both their family budget and time into both children and hope that this investment will pay off in the form of Lisa and Bartolomeo being successful in school and later in life. Lisa and Bartolomeo are usual children with some hobbies who study diligently but without extreme passion. They simply do what they got to do. Their results are good but not perfect. So their parents come and start the escalation archetype by telling the kids that the one with better marks will go on special holiday of their choice. As both Lisa and Bartolomeo like travelling a lot, they start to study hard. To satisfaction of their parents children's marks get soon better which is very positive outcome. Yet a problem arises. As they both study really hard to keep pace with the other one, something might go wrong. For example, when Bartolomeo is very creative and skillful painter but not so talented in studying usual subjects like math or languages. Sooner or later he will reach his limits. Then to keep up the good marks he will have to abandon his painting hobby and his talent will be wasted. Or he will try to sustain great marks and then Bartolomeo will start cheating during exams. However even when no negative effect happens there will be a difficulty how to reward children after Bartolome finishes second very closely. Should their parents appreciate only Lisa's effort or acknowledge also Bartolomeo's achievements. When they reward only Lisa, Bartolomeo could easily become demotivated and then it would be impossible to make use of positive effects of escalation archetype. On the other hand, rewarding both could mean the same and for both children as they realise that their extra effort does not have necessarily mean better outcome. There is also an alternative version of how competition amongst children can be affected by escalation archetype. When all parents motivate children to improve in comparison to their peers, they will all study harder and harder while the differences amongst participating kids will remain relatively stable (and if teachers increase requirements they will even retain their marks). Under such simple circumstances most children might benefit from the competition nevertheless children with weaker intellectual skill may become isolated when they are no longer able to pursue others. Reversely in another alternative scenario where all children are demotivated to study for some reason, their results are worse and worse (and if teachers decrease requirements they will retain their marks while being less educated) and downward spiral is working in a way that situation gets worse and worse.  Risks and opportunities  The dangers of systems with escalation archetypes are various. First, it might be difficult to identify the existence of archetype at the first sight. Then the behaviour of the system might look desirable at first and therefore requiring no immediate action. Another risk is a possibility of exponential growth within such structure. Finally the system might have different outcome in short term and long term. Escalation archetype comes with a possibility to make a big change in the system with a little input or a small action done at the beginning (due to the fact that it behaves like reinforcing loop).  Solution and optimization  To remove downward or upward spiral effect of escalation archetype there is a change in the system necessary which breaks the ongoing pattern. That change is typically switching the actors from non-cooperative game mode to cooperative game behaviour so that they stop escalating their actions to keep with others and rather find mutual solution and movement.

The first written mention of the cemetery dates from 1555, when a privilege was issued to Polish Jews permitting burial in the area. Many distinguished representatives of the Lublin Jewish community are buried there. Many of them have monumental and richly decorated matzevot headstones, but there are also matzevot without ornaments, which are evidence of modesty. In 1939 the cemetery probably held up to 3,000 matzevot. During the German occupation of Poland in 1939 and the start of the Holocaust, many of the matzevot were demolished or were used for street paving. The matzevot of several significant figures, however, remain. In the 1980s, the Association for the Preservation of the Jewish Heritage in Lublin (Towarzystwo Opieki nad PamiƒÖtkami Kultury ≈ªydowskiej) began to put the cemetery in order and to make a detailed inventory. Between 1988 and 1991 several antisemitic acts of vandalism took place, as a result of which 40 further matzevot (Macewy) were destroyed. Currently, the Old Jewish Cemetery in Lublin provides some of the last surviving physical evidence of the centuries-old presence of Jews in the city.

She successfully sued the Canton, Oklahoma schools regarding the right of students to obtain an education. Early life Viola Sutton was born 12 February 1930 to Arapaho Chief and Mennonite pastor Harry Arthur Sutton (10 July 1907 ‚Äì 16 May 1978) and Sallie Blackbear Sutton (17 April 1912 ‚Äì 8 July 1988) on her grandmother's allotment near Geary, Oklahoma. Around 1938, the family left Geary and returned to the Canton area where Sutton's father had an allotment which he inherited from his grandmother, Red Face. She was raised on the family allotment with her siblings: Cora Mae Sutton Scabbyhorse Querdibitty (5 September 1932 ‚Äì 16 September 2010), Patricia AnnJordan (1970), p 28 Sutton Walker (April 1935 ‚Äì 9 November 1997), Nancy Ruth Sutton (1937), Lavonta Sutton Kenrick (1939), former Arapaho chief William Ray \\"Billy\\" Sutton (21 December 1940 ‚Äì 10 January 2015), Charlene Sutton Lime (11 January 1943 ‚Äì 26 July 2013), Arthur Warren Sutton (1945‚Äì1945), Wilda Jean Sutton Allen Gould, (1947), Georgia Mae Sutton Roberts (2 May 1948 ‚Äì 16 November 2010), former Arapaho chief Allen D. Sutton (1950), Ava Dushane Sutton Benson (1954), and Marcella Dawn \\"Marci\\" Sutton Armijo (1967). Sutton attended school in Canton and then the Concho Indian Boarding School. Concho was a vocational training school based on a military-style discipline model. While the students did study the same curriculum as public school students by the time Sutton attended, it was a working farm and the students were expected to care for the livestock and cultivate the gardens. The purpose of boarding school education was to teach girls \\"life skills,\\" such as cooking and cleaning, and Christianity, to rid children of their pagan beliefs. Frustrated by insistence that she be trained for domestic work, Sutton abandoned further education and moved to Chicago as part of the Bureau of Indian Affairs Relocation Program. She found work at the Speigel Company which was operating as predominantly a mail-order clothing and home accessory company. Activism As the 1960s emerged, a growing sensitivity to minority rights was born, spurred by Supreme Court decisions such as Brown v. Board of Education, Gideon v. Wainwright, Loving v. Virginia and legislation including the Voting Rights Act of 1957, the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and the Fair Housing Act if 1968. Into this turbulent time, a pan-Indian movement developed predominantly with the goals of having the US government return native lands, right social ills, and provide funds for cultural education. The Red Power Movement and American Indian Movement were both born out of this pan-Indian awakening, and Viola was involved from the beginning. She had returned from Chicago and married Donald Hatch, a union organizer. Hatch opened senior and youth centers, worked with the homeless and VISTA volunteers, and urged political involvement by native peoples. She became involved in both local and national level organizations for Indian rights. Hatch also worked as a field operative for Oklahomans for Indian Opportunity (OIO), an organization developed by LaDonna Harris (Comanche) under the federal Office of Economic Opportunity programs. The creation of the OIO was the first effort in the state of Oklahoma for the western plains tribes in the state to work with the Five Civilized Tribes. Field operatives, like Viola, began organizing tribal Head Start Programs, programs to deal with high Indian drop-out rates, native economic development programs and tribal human services.Philip (1995), p 222-224 =National Indian Youth Council= In 1961, a conference with over 800 participants was held in Chicago, Illinois with educators and anthropologists, and frustrated Native Americans from 13‚Äì20 June which produced a \\"Declaration of Indian Purpose: the Voice of the American Indian\\" ‚Äì a policy created for Indians by Indians. They delivered the policy to President John F. Kennedy, but went on to form the National Indian Youth Council (NIYC) in Gallup, New Mexico later that summer, to translate words into actions. The founding members of NIYC ‚Äì Herbert Blatchford, Navajo Nation; Gerald Brown, Flathead Indian Reservation of Montana; Sam English, Ojibwe; Viola Hatch, Arapaho of the Cheyenne-Arapaho Tribe of Oklahoma; Joan Nobel, Ute; Karen Rickard, Tuscarora; Melvin Thom, Walker River Paiute Tribe of the Walker River Reservation, Nevada; Clyde Warrior, Ponca Tribe of Indians of Oklahoma; Della Warrior, Otoe-Missouria Tribe of Indians of Oklahoma; and Shirley Hill Witt, Mohawk ‚Äì included 3 members from Oklahoma. Although NIYC claimed to have hundreds of members, a core group of ten to fifteen people shaped the organization. Viola has continued to serve on the board from the inception through 2015. The goals of the National Indian Youth Council from the beginning were to honor and preserve the customs and lives of Native people. Their focus includes preserving traditional religious practices and sacred sites; elimination of barriers to full political participation by native citizens; promotion of public education for tribe members which honors Indian contributions to the overall culture and respects positive image reinforcement of native traditions, customs and people; employment training and placement; protection of treaty rights, including tribal sovereignty, hunting and fishing rights and environmental conservation; and promoting international coordination and support for protection of the rights of indigenous people throughout the Western Hemisphere. =American Indian Taskforces= When Nixon was elected in 1968, Indian activists were unsure of what his policies would be, in spite of campaign promises. They remembered the termination policies of his Republican predecessors and demanded a clear policy proving that self-determination had arrived. The president-elect requested that native leaders compile a document briefing him on policy, their desires and solutions, needs, and priorities. From January to February, 1969 a task force met and prepared the document, which would become the basis of the Special Recommendations on Indian Affairs delivered by Nixon on 8 July 1970.Josephy (1999), p 79 After completion of the report, the task force which was composed of \\"many of the best known Indian leaders in the country,\\" including HatchJosephy (1999), p 93 one of only six women on the task force, met in Washington, DC in November 1969 to present their ideas. On 10 November, they met with Vice President Spiro Agnew and on 12 November, they presented the statement to Congress. Their recommendations were that Indians needed to be involved in their own governance, be consulted, be allowed to design and implement processes, and be able to express their grievances and propose legislative and policy solutions. They asked for their sovereignty to be respected, for state governors to be required to honor treaties and federal statutes, and they asked for Congress to establish a system of redress so that if federal programs, which were designed for the benefit of Native Americans, were not in fact benefiting them, there would be mechanisms to obtain justice.Josephy (1999), pp 95‚Äì100 A second task force, also created in 1968, by the American Indian Policy Review Commission was charged with review of federal Indian law and policy to make recommendations of obsolete laws for repeal, consolidations of redundant provisions, or amendments of existing provisions to provide conformity throughout the US Code. Hatch, Frances Wise, Roberta Black and numerous other native leaders reported on the failures of the Department of Justice and the FBI to respond and/or investigate civil rights abuse claims by Indians against state and local law enforcement officers. The task force concluded its work in 1976 and made a full report to Congress. From June through August, 1974, a task force of Indian law students, Indian lawyers, and tribal representatives, assessed how tribal legal systems could be utilized to strengthen tribal governing bodies and implement judicial decisions. There were only three participants from Oklahoma on the task force‚ÄîHatch was the sole tribal representative and two Cherokee Nation student participants, Robert Steven Lowery and David Ricketts-Kingfisher. Seventeen reservations were visited with the goal of determining how to best implement the newly passed Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act. As administration of a wide range of government services which had previously been carried out by federal agencies were to become the responsibility of the tribes, the report was a first step in determining tribal readiness to do so. The analysis was an important one, as previously the federal government had been responsible for the complexities of overlapping jurisdictions of Indian Affairs. As tribal governing bodies moved to assume those roles, they had to be aware of state, federal, and municipal implications, as well as treaty provisions.Parker (1975), p 5 The report highlighted numerous deficiencies in tribal governing documents and tribal court systems and recommendations for eliminating those deficiencies.Parker (1975), pp 202-209 =American Indian Movement (AIM)= The American Indian Movement (AIM) was founded in 1968 by a group of Anishinaabe that included Dennis Banks, Mary Jane Wilson, George Mitchell, and Pat Ballanger. In 1969, while visiting the Occupation of Alcatraz, Banks, recruited John Trudell (Santee Sioux), who became AIM's primary spokesperson for the next decade and Russell Means (Oglala Lakota), who became AIM's primary strategist. As many as a dozen chapters sprang up in Oklahoma in the 1970s, led by Carter Camp (Ponca). The goals of the movement were self-determination of tribal people and development of a framework to address the critical issues ‚Äîracism, illness, poverty, high unemployment, sub- standard housing, inadequate educational opportunities, and abrogation of treaty agreements‚Äî facing them. On 12 September 1972, about forty to fifty Indians from the AIM movement, including Camp and Hatch, took over the office of the state Indian Education director, Overton James (Chickasaw) in Oklahoma City, to protest the way federal money for Indian education was allocated. In Oklahoma, about 150 school districts having 10 percent or greater American Indian enrollment, annually received $2 million from the Johnson-O'Malley subsidies. The activists claimed the funds were being spent on the general expenses of schools and not specifically for native students. Negotiations with the BIA broke down and the facility was occupied until 14 September, when a compromise was reached to freeze spending on Johnson-O'Malley funds for the fiscal year until an external audit of the expenditures could be undertaken. Partly because of her involvement with AIM, but partly through her work with the OIO, Hatch was sent a few months after the BIA incident to take charge of a situation which had developed in the schools at Hammon, Oklahoma. Because of long-standing prejudice against native students, lack of desire to preserve native heritage or even present it in a positive light, little support from administrators, high dropout rates, and improper use of Johnson-O'Malley subsidies in the Hammon Public School System, Cheyenne students and their parents were in favor of creating the Institute for the Southern Plains. Barney Bush (Shawnee) and other AIM activists came to the support of parents and students in their standoff and boycott of the Hammon Schools. Peggy Dycus (Sac & Fox) was in charge of running the Southern Plains School, but she had trouble obtaining utilities, or even a house to rent, as she had been branded as an AIM radical. The Hammon Public Schools were opposed to creation of the new school, as they were under pressure to keep up their own enrollment or lose both the Johnson-O'Malley funds and run the risk of being consolidated with another school district. The Institute's goal was to teach students in their own Cheyenne language, with teachers who were mostly Cheyenne and understood the cultural identity of their students. Hatch obtained a grant of $30,000 from the BIA, which enabled 65 students of all ages to enroll in the Institute. They graduated three students in 1974, before the institute was forced to close. =Wounded Knee= In January 1973, Dennis Banks began gathering AIM members for a major civil rights campaign to expose corruption on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, the poverty and broken treaties there, as well as several uninvestigated deaths. On February 28, 1973, about 150 activists, including Don and Viola Hatch, who were to hold a press conference that morning at Wounded Knee, woke to find that they were surrounded by Guardians of the Oglala Nation (GOONs), who had been sent by the newly elected president of the Oglala Sioux, Dick Wilson. The GOONs were soon joined by FBI personnel and some 60 members of the U.S. Marshals Special Operations Group brought in by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. The 71-day occupation of Wounded Knee had begun. The AIM activists were unprepared for armed conflict or a lengthy siege, and had to negotiate for food, clothing and arms to be smuggled in to the encampment. By 7 March 1973, 300 Marshals, 100 FBI agents, 250 BIA SWAT team agents, 150 GOONs and 150 non-Indian vigilantes had amassed to intercept and thwart any movement of goods or people into the compound. Nightly meetings were held by the activists to update them on what was happening and they would sing, drum, and pray. Don Hatch recounted Henry Crowdog, who adopted Hatch into his family, playing his guitar and singing Lakota songs. Eventually, electricity, water and food supplies were cut off by federal marshals and national guardsmen, in an attempt to break the standoff. Under heavy gunfire, Frank Clearwater, a Cherokee, and Buddy LaMonte, an Oglala Lakota, were killed. On 7 May 1973, the occupation ended when federal officials agreed to investigate the Wilson regime, abuses on the reservation, and treaty violations. In 1998, Viola returned to South Dakota on the 25th anniversary of the event to participate in the Commemoration of Wounded Knee. Two days of festivities were held, honoring those who had been there in 1973 ‚Äî those who had passed on and those who were still living ‚Äî renewing ties and holding educational meetings. =Hair-length and school appearance protest= On 20 September 1972, Viola's son, Buddy Hatch, was expelled from the fifth grade by his school principal because his haircut did not meet the school dress and appearance code. Hatch filed a civil rights lawsuit claiming that the hair-length rules of the school \\"violated their parental rights to raise their children according to their religious, cultural, and moral values\\". The United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit determined that hair length was not a constitutionally protected federal question and \\"should be handled through state procedures\\". Like other challenges before it, Hatch's case, arguing for free speech and free exercise of religion, failed because the law requires proof that a clearly established tenet of the religion exists, not just a preference or custom. However, the 10th Circuit did remand the case back to the lower court to further evaluate the allegations of violations of the Establishment Clause and whether the Hatch's son was dismissed without proper hearing in violation of due process. Disciplinary measures taken by schools cannot interfere with the right of a child to obtain an education per the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The case was resolved with Hatch claiming victory in setting a \\"fairness\\" precedent for students. =Repatriating Native remains= In 1989, the National Congress of American Indians (NCAI) held a conference to request that the Smithsonian Institution return and repatriate nearly 19,000 remains from Native Americans. Tribal representatives acknowledged that while anthropological studies of the skeletal remains could provide important and beneficial scientific information, once measurements and samples have been completed, they wanted the remains returned to their proper resting places. Hatch was vocal about tribal repatriation of ancestors and worked with other Indian leadership to secure the passage of the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act of 1990. =Walk for Survival= In the midst of her federal trial, Hatch continued her activism, organizing the Women's Healing Walk for Family and Mother Earth from Los Angeles, California to St. Augustine, Florida. The walk took place from 11 February ‚Äì 11 July 1996 and was made in remembrance of the Indian prisoners that were incarcerated at Fort Marion Prison in Florida. Between 1875 and 1878, 72 Cheyenne, Kiowa, Comanche, Caddo and Arapaho leaders and their families were interned in the prison and by the 1880s they were joined by hundreds of Apaches as prisoners of war. Two years after George Armstrong Custer's defeat at the Battle of Little Bighorn, the first prisoners were finally allowed to leave. The walk was the first such commemoration of the native prisoners by Indian people and also focused on cleansing rites to protest nuclear dumping and desecration of burial mounds and other sacred sites. The closing ceremony at the Wind River Indian Reservation in Wyoming featured the Arapaho Sundance. =Bear Butte Defenders= In May 2002, the City of Sturgis, and a group of private businessmen, submitted an application to Governor William Janklow for community development funds to build a sports complex and shooting range about 4 miles north of Bear Butte, a sacred place used for thousands of years by the Arapaho, Cheyenne, Sioux, and 30 other tribes for ceremonial purposes. Janklow approved the application and authorized funds of $825,000 from Housing and Urban Development (HUD) funds without obtaining consultation from the tribes or verifying that the proposal met requirements of the National Historic Preservation Act for National Historic Landmarks, or the National Environmental Policy Act. In 2003, the Northern Cheyenne, Rosebud Sioux, Crow Creek Sioux, Yankton Sioux tribes and Defenders of the Black Hills filed for an injunction in a Rapid City, South Dakota U.S. District Court to halt the project and the spending of federal funds for it. Viola and her husband Don were among the coalition of defenders to protect Bear Butte and participated in the demonstrations. In December 2003 HUD funds were returned and in January 2004 the project was abandoned. In February 2006, a long-term planning meeting of the Intertribal Coalition to Defend the Bear Butte, met in Sturgis, South Dakota with international partners, tribal members and leadership, and other supporters to develop strategies to protect the sacred site. Hatch and her husband attended as representatives for the Southern Cheyenne and Arapaho tribes. A Mato Paha Preservation Fund was organized as were several meetings and celebrations to educate tribes throughout the Great Plains region regarding preservation efforts. =Longest Walks= On the 30th anniversary of the original Longest Walk, a five-month walk from San Francisco, California to Washington, DC, a walk was sponsored by Dennis Banks to raise environmental awareness. The original walk began on 11 February 1978, with nearly 2,000 participants and ended in Washington DC on July 15, 1978. Almost two dozen people had walked the entire 2,700 miles in an event that had been planned by the AIM Movement to protest 11 pieces of legislation. More than 100 Native American tribes supported the walk and its goals of protecting tribal sovereignty, native land rights and indigenous water and environmental rights. For the 2008 walk, which traveled through Oklahoma from 3 May to 13 May, Viola served as the lead walker, Oklahoma coordinator, and hosted a benefit dance to honor Banks and her husband Don Hatch. In 2012, the Longest Walk III, walkers left Alcatraz Island on 18 December 2011 and arrived in Washington, DC on 18 May 2012. Hatch hosted the walkers at her home in Canton, Oklahoma on 1 April 2011. The third Walk, was focused on the plight of the 36-year incarceration of AIM member Leonard Peltier. The 2013 Longest Walk IV reversed the path of the previous walks and left Washington, DC on 15 July 2013 and arrived at Alcatraz Island on 21 December 2013. The purpose of the fourth Walk was to reaffirm tribal sovereignty and the spiritual relationships with native lands. Hatch and her family again supported the Oklahoma portion of the walk. Tribal Officer In 1982, Hatch was elected as vice chair of the Business Committee of the Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes. She also served on the business committee from 1982 to 1983, 1984 to 1985, 1988 to 1989, 1990 to 1991, and 1992 to 1993.Fowler (2002), pp 186-188 From 1987 to 1988 Hatch served as vice chair of the tribes. She was elected as treasurer for the 1989‚Äì1990 term and although not elected to the office, continued to serve as treasurer and sign tribal documents at the direction of the business council in 1990 and 1991. Hatch was elected and served as Tribal Chair from 1994 to 1995. =Tribal Taxation Authority= In 1988, Hatch, along with other members of the business council were sued by a consortium of oil and gas producers, who alleged that the Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes' 1988 statute imposing a severance tax on oil and gas production on all lands in the Tribal jurisdiction was invalid because it included allotted lands of tribal members. On 3 January 1994, the Tribal Supreme Court ruled that the \\"territorial jurisdiction encompasse[d] all allotted lands.\\" The oil and gas interests appealed the case to the U.S. Western District Court for Oklahoma in an action styled Mustang Fuel Corp. v. Hatch. The court upheld the right of the tribes to tax lands allotted in 1890 stating, \\"The allotted lands were validly set apart for use of the Tribes' members at that time and have continually been in federally protected status. Therefore, the Tribes can validly impose a tax on the valuable oil and gas development taking place on those lands as a source of revenue to fund tribal services within their territory\\". It was an important procedural victory for native people and has been used as a basis for other tribal disputes with oil and gas entities and tribal land use applications. =Gaming Ordinance= During Hatch's tenure as chair, the tribe submitted a tribal gaming ordinance, which was approved by the National Indian Gaming Commission (NIGC). Shortly thereafter, the Lucky Star Casino was built in Concho. By 2004, the tribe had expanded to a second casino in Clinton, Oklahoma and by 2015 their gaming enterprises encompassed 5 casinos. Indian Gaming has become a major income source to both the tribe and the state of Oklahoma. =Federal prosecution= In March 1995, Hatch was removed from office, as she, a former state senator, and two other past tribal officers, including Juanita Learned, of Cheyenne- Arapaho tribes were named in a 32-count federal indictment alleging they conspired to embezzle tribal funds. An audit by the Interior Department in 1992 had claimed that hundreds of thousands of dollars had been misused by the tribal business committee resulting in the near bankruptcy of the tribes. Hatch was one of the tribal chairs accused and had served as treasurer when the alleged discrepancies occurred. The actual indictment alleged that approximately $18,000 was falsely filed between January 1989 to December 1991. In July 1995, in a federal courthouse in the U.S. Western District Court at Oklahoma City, Hatch and the other tribe members were indicted on charges of embezzlement, conversion, and conspiracy. The alleged travel expenditure violations were based on $734 of federal funds spent by Hatch, which were investigated over a 3-year period at a cost of several hundred thousand dollars by the federal government. The embezzlement and conspiracy charges were dismissed for lack of evidence. Hatch was convicted of receiving funds for conferences she did not attend and sentenced to 12 months in prison.Fowler (2002), p 182 She was convicted of \\"conversion\\" which legally means that she had lawfully come into possession of the funds but then afterwards illegally used the funds. Her conviction was appealed to the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver, Colorado and overturned. According to court documents, while there were irregularities and a lack of oversight protections in the processing of travel expense claims, the government's allegations that Hatch ever possessed the funds were unsubstantiated. The government based its claim on the fact that as treasurer Hatch had access to tribal funds and a fiduciary responsibility over them; therefore, she had \\"ownership\\" of funds. However, the appellate court ruled that Hatch did not have sole discretionary use, as signatures of the business manager, the business committee chairman, and the comptroller were required for her to disburse any funds. The laxity of the business committee operations allowed overpayment of expenses, without any method of tracking double-payments, but did not constitute that Hatch knew overpayments were occurring or that she had discretionary authority over tribal funds. Her sentence, along with those of the others accused, was vacated by the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals. Personal life In addition to her activism, Hatch volunteered as a cultural and heritage speaker for schools, libraries and other organizations. She served on the Southern Arapaho Language Advisory Board and is an honored elder board member of the Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribe. She participated in Women of All Red Nations and the Arts & Crafts Cooperative. Hatch was involved with Bob Dotson's production at KWTV News of the documentary Till It's Here No More. Hatch traveled to international indigenous rights meetings and participated in the United Nations Forum in Geneva, Switzerland which developed the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. She met with the Ambassador to the European Union for the Sacred Sites meeting in a trip to Ireland and Northern Ireland. On 5 June 1954, she married Donald Vernon Hatch (9 November 1929 ‚Äì 7 August 2013). The couple had four children.

Enolates are a common building block in chemical syntheses and are typically formed by the addition of base to a ketone or aldehyde. Modified Aldol tandem reactions allow similar reactivity to be produced without the need for a base which may have adverse effects in a given chemical synthesis. A representative example is the decarboxylative aldol reaction (Figure \\"Modified aldol tandem reaction, decarboxylative aldol reaction as an example\\"), where the enolate is generated via decarboxylation reaction mediated by either transition metals or organocatalysts. Key advantage of this reaction over other types of aldol reaction is the selective generation of an enolate in the presence of aldehydes. This allows for the directed aldol reaction to produce a desired cross aldol. Transition metals have been used to mediate the modified aldol tandem reaction. Allyl Œ≤-keto carboxylates can be used as substrate for palladium-mediated decarboxylative aldol reaction (Figure \\"Palladium-mediated decarboxylative aldol reaction with allyl Œ≤-keto carboxylates\\"). The allyl group can be removed by palladium, following decarboxylation reaction selectively generates the enolate at the Œ≤-keto group, which could further react with aldehyde to generate aldols. Using decarboxylation reaction to generate enolate is a common strategy in biosynthetic pathways such as polyketide synthesis, where malonic acid half thioester can be converted to the corresponding enolate for Claisen condensation reaction. Inspired by this, a modified tandem aldol reaction has been developed using the malonic acid half thioester as the enolate source. A copper based catalyst system has been developed for efficient aldol generation at mild conditions (Figure \\"Decarboxylative aldol reaction with malonic acid half thioester\\").

Life Hennell was born in Manchester in 1802. She was the eldest daughter of the Unitarian family of James and Elizabeth Hennell (born Marshall). Her mother had been born in Loughborough in the East Midlands in 1778 and had the maiden name of Marshall. Her father was born in 1778 and he had become a partner in the Manchester merchants of Fazy & Co. Sara's younger sisters included the writers Sara and Caroline Hennell. The sisters are considered to be the basis for the fictional Meyrick family in George Eliot's 1876 novel Daniel Deronda. In 1836, Charles Bray married her sister Caroline. After his sister's marriage to Bray, an enthusiastic skeptic, her brother Charles Hennell reviewed the evidences for Christian beliefs with the aim of parrying his brother-in-law's arguments. The result of the examination was that he became a sceptic himself, and in 1838 published an Enquiry concerning the Origin of Christianity in defence of his conclusions. Sara also increasingly became a skeptic too. In 1841 Charles Bray published The Philosophy of Necessity and this included as an appendix written by Mary. This was titled An outline of the various social systems and communities which have been founded on the principle of co-operation and this was later made into a publication in its right in 1844. The new version had a lengthy preface that described British social conditions.J. M. Scott, ‚ÄòHennell, Mary (1802‚Äì1843)‚Äô, rev. C. A. Creffield, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 24 Jan 2015 Hennell also wrote an entry for Ribbons in the Penny Cyclopaedia. The entry drew on the expertise she had gained from her family's involvement in the manufacture of ribbons. Her uncle, Samuel Hennell, manufactured ribbons in Coventry as did the family of Charles Bray. Hennell died in Hackney in 1843 from tuberculosis.

In 1981, Csuri obtained funding from local investor Robert Cranston Kanuth to commercially exploit computer animation technology created by Ohio State University's Computer Graphics Research Group (CGRG). CCP and CGRG shared a single facility on campus. Csuri initially recruited six CGRG researchers to join the company: Wayne Carlson, Michael Collery, Marc Howard, Bob Marshall, Don Stredney, and Ed Tripp. Soon to follow were president James Kristoff (MetroLight), animator Maria Palazzi (ACCAD), John Berton, and Julian Gomez (Sun, Apple, NASA), creator of the animation system Twixt. The suite of production tools developed by CGRG for character animation, procedural effects, modeling, and rendering ultimately saw use in approximately 800 groundbreaking animated television and advertising projects. Paul Sidlo (RezN8) joined the team as creative director and launched the design department, which was staffed by Ron Tsang, Paul Conley, Steve Martino (Blue Sky), and John Weber. CCP shut down late in 1987 following the collapse of promising initial efforts to license its software, which ran only on expensive mainframe computers. By the late '80s, computer animation production had begun to switch from mainframes to cheaper desktop computers with 3D graphics capabilities, such as SGI workstations running retail software like Alias Wavefront. This change not only launched many new competing production houses, but also rapidly eliminated the market for mainframe-based graphics products. CGRG, renamed the Advanced Computing Center for Art and Design (ACCAD), remains in operation.

Christine Sophie von G√§hler, n√©e von Ahlefeldt (1745 ‚Äì 18 July 1792) was a Danish noble and courtier, known for her love life and unconventional life style, known in history as one of the Three Graces of the Danish royal court. Life She was born to colonel noble Henrik von Ahlefeldt (1711-1765) and Frederikke Marsilia Krag (1724-1756). In 1762, she married the officer noble Peter Elias von G√§hler. Her spouse had no title other than that of General, and she was thereby known by the female form of this title, Generalinde ('literary: Generaless'). From 1767 onward, her spouse made a successful career as court official, and she was from that point an active participator in court life. =Court life= Christine Sophie von G√§hler was a leading profile of the royal court of King Christian VII of Denmark, where she attracted attention with her beauty, her vivaciousness, sarcastic wit and humorous temper. Together with the baroness Anna Sofie B√ºlow and countess Amalie Sofie Holstein, she became known as one of the Three Graces of the Danish royal court. She was a leading figure of the court and well regarded by both the King as well as the Queen: she was regarded as socially indispensable at the card games played by the king and his favorites Enevold Brandt and Christian Frederik Holstein, as well as by queen Caroline Matilda of Great Britain, when she enjoyed outings with her ladies-in-waiting during her summers in the countryside, during which they were escorted by their admirers while their husbands were left at home. She became known for her lovers, whether there was truth in these rumors or not, though she always referred to her spouse in public. Contemporary chronicles claim that she had an affair with Claude Louis, Comte de Saint-Germain because she needed his financial assistance to both her spouse and her true lover, and the letter writer Luise Gramm claim that her good relation to Struensee once made the queen jealous. August Fjelstrup: Damerne ved Karoline Mathildes Hof, 1909. As a person, she comes across in her correspondence as a free-minded and tolerant person who disliked gossip and plots who had the ability to be civil and see the good also in people she disliked.August Fjelstrup: Damerne ved Karoline Mathildes Hof, 1909. She is described as the female courtier perhaps most favored by the queen and almost always in her company at card games, masked balls and outings, a friendship that was established at least from 1767 onward.August Fjelstrup: Damerne ved Karoline Mathildes Hof, 1909. In 1770, she accompanied the king and queen upon their tour through the Duchies, during which she corresponded with her spouse.August Fjelstrup: Damerne ved Karoline Mathildes Hof, 1909. At that trip, she accompanied the queen in the informal dinners and outings she enjoyed with Struensee and their closets friends.August Fjelstrup: Damerne ved Karoline Mathildes Hof, 1909. In 1771, she was given the order of the queen because of their close friendship. She was also present with the queen at Hirschholm Palace during the summer of 1771. Christine Sophie von G√§hler was decorated with the Ordenen de l'Union Parfaite (1765) and the Order of Mathilde, Mathildeordenen (1771). =Fall of Struensee= In connection to the fall of the queen's lover Struensee, Christine Sophie von G√§hler and her spouse were both arrested and imprisoned on the night of 16‚Äì17 January 1772, after which their home was searched. At her arrest, she showed no fear but calmly commented that she was glad to accompany her spouse in prison.August Fjelstrup: Damerne ved Karoline Mathildes Hof, 1909. Her son commented, that he was not worried about his father, as he had surely been very careful, but that he was very worried about his mother.August Fjelstrup: Damerne ved Karoline Mathildes Hof, 1909. The reason for her arrest was that her close relationship with the queen, the good contact she had with Struensee, and the favors she had enjoyed because of it, made her and her spouse suspected to be involved in the queen's crime, and she was also suspected of having been given political documents for safe keeping; her spouse was arrested because of his political career under Struensee.August Fjelstrup: Damerne ved Karoline Mathildes Hof, 1909. However, nothing incriminating was found. During interrogation, she claimed never to have been involved in state affairs, and that she had also advised her spouse to defer from it, but that they had needed his salary from his career under Struensee.August Fjelstrup: Damerne ved Karoline Mathildes Hof, 1909. =Later life= She was freed and released in May of that year, officially cleared, though she was warned that she was worthy of a punishment for her \\"foolish and unwise behavior\\". Her spouse was, however, deprived of all his offices and the couple were expelled and also banned from residing in any of their estates. They were therefore forced to leave Denmark, and settled in Itzehoe in Germany. One of her admirers, general major J. F. Classen, aided them economically by granting them a yearly income. She became a widow in 1783. In 1792, she married count Carl Alexander von der Goltz, but died during her wedding night.  References  * Nordisk familjebok, G√§hler, Peter Elias von, 1904‚Äì1926. * v.

It has an Indo-Pacific distribution . It is closely related to two other species of white spotted groupers in the genus Epinephelus. Description The whitespotted grouper is a moderately deep- bodied fish growing to a maximum length of about . There are three to five rows of teeth in the lower jaw. The dorsal fin has eleven spines and about sixteen soft rays and the anal fin has three spines and eight soft rays. The pelvic fins are short and the caudal fin is rounded. The top edge of the opercular cover is only slightly convex and the posterior edge curves at an acute angle. The head, body and dorsal fin are dark brownish-grey, spotted with large white blotches. In large adults, over about , the white patches tend to merge into wavy bands or mottling. Distribution The whitespotted grouper is found in shallow water in the Indo-Pacific region. Its range extends from the coast of East Africa and the Persian Gulf eastwards to Japan, China, Indonesia, Australia, Fiji and Tonga. Ecology The whitespotted grouper is a demersal, shallow-water, reef-associated fish. It is generally found in rocky areas, or near where coral is growing in deep lagoons, or on outer reef slopes or channels, often near or in caves. It is not a schooling fish and is usually seen singly. It feeds on small fish and crustaceans, with crustaceans making up the greatest part of its diet. Little is known about its reproduction and life history. Status The whitespotted grouper has a wide range and is common in places and uncommon in others. The population trend for this fish is unknown but it is caught in artisan fisheries throughout its range. The fish is found in a number of protected areas and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as being of \\"least concern\\". Parasites As all fish, the whitespotted grouper has many parasite species. The diplectanid monogenean Pseudorhabdosynochus bacchus is a parasite of the gills. Other parasites include copepods and species of Haliotrema (Monogenea) on the gills and the opecoelid digenean Cainocreadium epinepheli in the caeca. Taxonomy The whitespotted grouper was first formally described as Holocentrus coeruleopunctatus in 1790 by the German naturalist Marcus Elieser Bloch (1723‚Äì1799) with the type locality not given but thought to be Indonesia. This species is closely related to other species of grouper marked with white spots Epinephelus ongus, Epinephelus summana, and Epinephelus corallicola.

Early life Happel received his PhD in engineering from RWTH Aachen University. Career In 1974, Happel became CEO of GEA Group, a small family business established by his father in 1920 with approximately 100 million EUR revenues. Over the next 25 years, he transformed GEA into a global system supplier and introduced machinery and plants for the food processing industry, power industry, air-conditioning and refrigeration industry. After making over 70 acquisitions, GEA had over 200 subsidiaries in 60 countries. In 1989 he took his company public at the Frankfurt stock exchange, but kept the majority of the voting stock in the family. By 1999, Happel had increased GEA's revenues to over ‚Ç¨2.6 billion, as well as its net earnings proportionally. In 1999 he merged his controlling stake with Germany‚Äôs MG Technologies, remained the largest shareholder of the combined businesses and, once MG Technologies merged into GEA Group AG, sold his dominant stake to institutional investors in 2006. GEA Group AG is the largest listed German machinery manufacturer and is broadly diversified. In 2018, it accounted for revenues of approximately EUR 4,8 bn and employed approximately 18,600 people. He served as a member of the supervisory board at Commerzbank from May 1993 until April 2013. As of February 2020, Forbes estimated his net worth at US$2.8 billion.

Life and work  He was probably related to the sculptor Hans Leinberger, who also lived in Landshut, but the relationship is unclear. It appears certain that he took his first lessons from Leinberger, however, then was apprenticed to Hans Wertinger, the court painter for Duke Louis X. After that, he travelled to Regensburg, where he studied with Albrecht Altdorfer and had a hand in creating the woodcuts for the \\"Triumphal Procession\\" of Emperor Maximilian I. Around 1520, his style is noticeable in a panel painting, \\"The Conversion of Saint Paul\\", in the Bishopric of Naumburg- Zeitz. In 1522, he appears in Leipzig, where he created the \\"Epitaph for Valentin Schmidburg\\" (a medical doctor who had also served as a city counselor and syndic), which is now in the Museum der bildenden K√ºnste. A year later, he was made a citizen of Leipzig. The next record of him is in 1530, when he was served legal process on charges of abusing his wife. Two years later, he was banished by George, Duke of Saxony for being a Lutheran. He then went to Magdeburg, where he created 125 woodcuts for the \\"Low German Bible\\" of Johannes Bugenhagen; printed by Melchior Lotter. The last confirmed record of him comes from 1537, when he was a registered participant at the Easter Vigil in Leipzig. It is assumed that he died no later than 1545, in either Leipzig or Magdeburg. He also created woodcuts for the first part of the Luther Bible (1523), the title page and some illustrations for the so-called \\"Emser Testament\\" (1527) and the title and two folios for the Gustav Vasa Bible (1541). His few surviving artworks include a depiction of the Turkish Siege of Vienna in Merseburg Cathedral (1529) and \\"Fall and Redemption\\" (1535), now in the Germanisches Nationalmuseum of Nuremberg. A \\"Crucifixion\\" at the Church of L√∂ssen in Schkopau was lost in 1975, during the Communist regime.

Research interests  Hebert's research is published in several scholarly books and 35 different professional journals. =Music competition in Japan= In 2012, Hebert published Wind Bands and Cultural Identity in Japanese Schools,Hebert, David (2012). Wind Bands and Cultural Identity in Japanese School. Dordrecht: Springer Press a book that identified the world's largest music competition and documented the experiences of its participants. With more than 14,000 competing wind bands and widely admired performances, Japan is an especially important nation for instrumental music education, and Hebert's ethnographic and historical monograph has been described in the journal Music Education Research as \\"the most comprehensive information about concert (wind) band participation in any country.\\" According to a review in the British Journal of Music Education, \\"David Hebert delved deep under the surface of the seemingly everyday where he discovered anomalies and cultural specifics that are unlike anything found in the West ... His book performs the remarkable: a call to explore new ways of doing high school band programmes differently.\\"Norman Stanfield (2014). Wind Bands and Cultural Identity in Japanese Schools. \\"British Journal of Music Education\\", 31(1), pp.103-105. A sociologist with Tokyo Metropolitan University has said that this book \\"can serve as an important reference and inform the decisions of those attempting to advance changes to the educational system.\\"Nishijima, Hiroshi (2013). Wind Bands and Cultural Identity in Japanese Schools. \\"Social Science Japan Journal\\", 16(2), pp.337-340. The book also describes Japanese composers, and has been used for concert program notes by prominent conductors, such as Eugene Corporon, and Timothy Reynish (who describes it as \\"compulsory reading for anyone interested in Japanese music\\") This book helps to explain why music competitions are a global phenomenon.Hebert, David G. (2019). Competition in Music. SAGE International Encyclopedia of Music and Culture (Janet Sturman, Ed.), Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications, vol.2, p.610-613. =Music globalization, transculturation and hybridity= According to Roberta Pike, Hebert asserts that \\"research is needed to explore the role of culture in music education.\\"Roberta E. Pike, Japanese Education: Selective Bibliography of Psychosocial Aspects (Fremont, CA: Jain, 2007), p.83. From a global perspective, Hebert has examined how musical practices, technologies, and genres are adopted into new contexts, including educational and religious traditions within institutions.Hebert, D.

In V. Kurkela & L. Vakeva (Eds.), De-Canonizing Music History. Newcastle: Cambridge Scholars Press, p.178. In 2008 at Boston University, he taught a course on the topic of \\"Music Transculturation and Hybridity\\". Hebert's research on this topic builds on the scholarship of Bruno Nettl, Margaret Kartomi, Mark Slobin, Timothy Taylor, and Tina Ramnarine. He twice served as keynote speaker for conferences on Music and Globalization in Poland, and the resulting book Music Glocalization has been described as \\"highly original\\" and \\"the first comprehensive account of how the notion of ‚Äòglocalization‚Äô may be useful in rethinking nationality in music and the use of local musical traditions that serve as a means for global strategies.\\" In the book, Hebert collaborated with Polish musicologist Mikolaj Rykowski to introduce theoretical models and the term ‚Äòglocklization‚Äô, which combines the glocal concept with a Glock pistol, to indicate unbalanced forms of glocalization perceived as destructive to cultural heritage.Hebert, David & Rykowski, Mikolaj. (2018). Music Glocalization: Heritage and Innovation in a Digital Age. Newcastle: Cambridge Scholars, p.354. =Pluralism and music institutions= Hebert's work has also addressed the challenges of representing cultural diversity and embracing pluralism in music education, claiming for music a unique role in intercultural communication.Hebert, David (2010). \\"Ethnicity and Music Education: Sociological Dimensions\\".

Draves (2011). Sociology and Music Education. \\"Journal of Historical Research in Music Education\\", 33(1), pp.109. Extending in directions pioneered by his PhD mentor Patricia Shehan Campbell, Hebert has also written of \\"the challenges of multicultural teaching in music\\" and \\"the central role that ethnic identity plays in musical meaning and engagement.\\" His research in this area has often been in collaboration with Nordic scholars, including Eva Saether and Marja Heimonen.Marja Heimonen and David G.

Along with William Coppola and Patricia Shehan Campbell, he co-authored Teaching World Music in Higher Education as vol.7 of the Routledge World Music Pedagogy series. =Nationalism in music education= Hebert co-edited with Alexandra Kertz- Welzel (Professor and Chair, University of Munich), the 2012 book Patriotism and Nationalism in Music Education.Hebert, David and Kertz-Welzel, Alexandra (2012).Patriotism and Nationalism in Music Education. Aldershot, UK: Ashgate Press This book includes contributions by music education researchers from several continents, and according to History of Education, discusses \\"how music contributes to the creation of an emotional climate in schools, and its function in fostering the formation of particular loyalties, identities and dispositions.\\" Music psychologist John Sloboda described this book as \\"a 'must read' resource for anyone interested in this topic.\\"John Sloboda (2012). Patriotism and nationalism in music education: A review essay \\"International Journal of Education & the Arts\\", 13. According to a review in Fontes Artis Musicae, Hebert and Kertz-Welzel pose \\"challenging questions about the role of music teachers in propagating and inculcating patriotic sentiments\\", and the book is relevant beyond the sociology of music, to any \\"scholars engaged in researching comparative and political educational issues.\\"Veronica Jamset. (2013). Patriotism and Nationalism in Music Education. \\"Fontes Artis Musicae\\", 60(2), pp.123-125.

Finnish Journal of Music Education, 13(1), pp.6-11. =Historical ethnomusicology= Hebert's interests in global music historiography developed as he explored such topics as how European music was adopted in Japan, and how the American genres of jazz and rock music ironically struggled to gain acceptance in American schools.David G. Hebert (2011). \\"Originality and Institutionalization: Factors Engendering Resistance to Popular Music Pedagogy in the USA\\". Music Education Research International, 5, pp.12-21; David G.

In 2014 he produced a book with Jonathan McCollum (Washington College) entitled Theory and Method in Historical Ethnomusicology.McCollum, Jonathan and Hebert, David (2014) Theory and Method in Historical Ethnomusicology Lanham, MD: Lexington Books / Rowman & Littlefield Through use of \\"a broad spectrum of geocultural examples, the volume includes several engaging strategies for using and writing about history in order to understand the world's musics\\".Justin R. Hunter (2016). Theory and Method in Historical Ethnomusicology. \\"NOTES\\", 72(3), pp.534-537. Ethnomusicologists Keith Howard, Daniel M. Neuman and Judah Cohen contributed chapters. Hebert now edits a book series in this field with Jonathan McCollum for Rowman and Littlefield press, The Lexington Series in Historical Ethnomusicology: Deep Soundings. =Music technology, virtuality, and online music education= Hebert has also been active in researching the application of new technologies in online music education and research. Prior to becoming interested in \\"big data\\", he authored an article examining the challenges of educating music teachers in a fully online doctoral program (at Boston University).David G. Hebert (2008). \\"Reflections on Teaching the Aesthetics and Sociology of Music Online\\". International Review of the Aesthetics and Sociology of Music, 39(1), pp.93-103; David G.

Phillips, among others ‚Äì that led to further publications on projects in Europe and Africa that made use of the Internet to support intercultural music exchange.Ruthmann, Alex and Hebert, David (2012) \\"Music Learning and New Media in Virtual and Online Environments\\".

Hebert (2009). \\"On Virtuality and Music Education in Online Environments\\" (in Hungarian translation, by Mariann Abraham) ‚Äò‚ÄôParlando‚Äô‚Äô Vol. 48(4). as well as digital humanities and \\"big data\\" approaches with Danish computer scientist and computational musicologist Kristoffer Jensen.Kristoffer Jensen and David G. Hebert (2016). Evaluation and Prediction of Harmonic Complexity Across 76 Years of Billboard 100 Hits. In R. Kronland-Martinet, M. Aramaki, and S. Ystad, (Eds.), Music, Mind, and Embodiment. Switzerland: Springer Press, pp.283-296. ; Grund, C.M and Westney, W. (2010). Music, Movement, Performance & Perception: Perspectives on Cross-Disciplinary Research and Teaching within NNIMIPA - Nordic Network for the Integration of Music Informatics, Performance and Aesthetics. . =East Asian studies= Hebert has researched music in Japan, where he lived for about 5 years, and he often lectures for leading universities and conservatories in China. He has published several articles and book chapters on western music in Japan (and Korea), and developed International Perspectives on Translation, Education, and Innovation in Japanese and Korean Societies (Springer), the 25th anniversary proceedings of the Nordic Association for Japanese and Korean Studies. The journal Korean Studies notes that this book‚Äôs \\"chapters echo the broader theme that language and translation are a font of innovation in East Asian society. This is a provocative idea, and the book does identify some tantalizing evidence.\\" Hebert has also drawn attention to East Asian arts through the International Sociological Association.. Also see:  Philosophical orientation  Hebert claims that postmodernist discourse no longer offers an adequate explanation for contemporary musical practices, and that most music philosophy suffers from an ethnocentric orientation. Rather, he advocates a global-historical perspective: that humanity has recently exited a period of \\"digital prehistory\\" to enter a phase of \\"data saturation\\" through ubiquitous mass surveillance,Hebert, David and McCollum, Jonathan (2014). \\"Philosophy of History and Theory in Historical Ethnomusicology\\". In J. McCollum and D. G. Hebert, Eds., Theory and Method in Historical Ethnomusicology. Lanham, MD: Lexington Books / Rowman & Littlefield, pp.85-148 causing conditions he describes as \\"glocalimbodied,\\"David G. Hebert (2009). \\"On Virtuality and Music Education in Online Environments\\". Parlando, 48(4) [in Hungarian translation, by Mariann Abraham]. meaning that local and global forces converge to \\"stamp\\" the identities of individual actors suspended within a social structure shaped by participatory media. Hebert also argues that music, now most commonly consumed in digital form, may be understood as \\"content\\" in a \\"selfie-stick society\\". In his view, this new context results in music creation and consumption increasingly transcending earlier connections to space and time, engendering both a blurring and reactionary institutionalization of local genres and historical styles. Consequently, Hebert contends that music education policies and practices should be re- envisioned to emphasize individual originality and empowerment via a musicianship of \\"flexibility\\",Hebert, David (2009) \\"Musicianship, Musical Identity and Meaning as Embodied Practice\\" In T. Regelski & J. T. Gates (Eds.), Music Education for Changing Times: Guiding Visions for Practice. Dordrecht: Springer Press, pp.39-55. with inclusion of marginalized traditions, cultivation of both acoustic and digital competencies, and rejection of any ties to \\"aesthetic fundamentalism\\", techno-utopianism, militarism and nationalism.Hebert, David (2015) \\"Militarism and Music Education\\". Music Educators Journal, vol.101, no. 3, pp.77-84. Music scholars have noted that Hebert \\"believes music education will become more relevant and effective when it attends more completely to 'creative agency via technology and musical hybridity',\\" and that \\"Music learned in school should have some connection to the music the student engages with outside of school and that musicianship should be understood as an ‚Äòembodied practice situated in sociocultural contexts‚Äô.\\"Jeananne Nichols (2011). Music education for changing times: A review essay \\"International Journal of Education & the Arts\\", 12. An advocate for increased contemporary music, music technology, and popular music in schools, Hebert nevertheless warns that these should not be seen as panacea for poor teaching or inadequate funding and facilities, and that historical traditions ‚Äì including the heritage of \\"classical\\" art music ‚Äì still legitimately require ample space in school education. Hebert's work especially promotes the value of internationalism in teacher education,David G. Hebert, Tuovi Martinsen, and Keld Hosbond (2010). \\"Launching the Nordic Master of Global Music Program\\". Finnish Journal of Music Education, 13(1), pp.88-91; David G. Hebert and Eva Saether (2014). \\"Please Give Me Space: Findings and Implications from an Evaluation of the Glomus Intercultural Music Camp, Ghana 2011\\". Music Education Research, 16(4), pp.418-435. and emphasizes the importance of an international-comparative perspective for envisioning improvements to educational policies and practices.David G. Hebert (2012). \\"International Comparisons in the Improvement of Education\\". Signum Temporis: Journal of Pedagogy and Psychology, 5(2), pp.17-27. Criticism. While largely accepted, some of Hebert's conclusions have faced opposition from other scholars. His research in Japan controversially suggests that some important aspects of music history are inaccurately \\"remembered\\", and he has argued that similar issues may be found in common music history textbooks in the US and elsewhere.Hebert, David and McCollum, Jonathan (2014). \\"Philosophy of History and Theory in Historical Ethnomusicology\\". In J. McCollum and D. G. Hebert, Eds., Theory and Method in Historical Ethnomusicology. Lanham, MD: Lexington Books / Rowman & Littlefield, pp.85-148 Hebert asserts that music contests can have not only positive, but also negative consequences for participants and the musical traditions they display, and require careful design for desirable outcomes. Some music educators defend traditional pedagogies that Hebert and others claim need to be redeveloped or supplemented with new approaches.Mark Fonder \\"No Default or Reset Necessary ‚Äì Large Ensembles Enrich Many.\\"; See debate between Hebert and Kenneth Phillips in 2008, \\"Research and Issues in Music Education\\", 6. Robert Walker and Roger Scruton would disagree with Hebert's position regarding the value of popular music pedagogy.Robert Walker (2007). Music Education: Cultural Values, Social Change and Innovation. Springfield, IL: Charles C. Thomas. Vincent Bates has argued that a \\"cosmopolitan\\" perspective may already receive excessive emphasis in the field of music education,Vincent C. Bates (2014). \\"Rethinking cosmopolitanism in music education.\\". Action, Criticism, and Theory for Music Education 13(1): 310‚Äì27. while Thomas Regelski has suggested that \\"culture\\" ‚Äì a concept emphasized in much of Hebert's writings ‚Äì is a nebulous construct with questionable utility for the field.Thomas Regelski (2010). \\"Culturalism, Multi-Culturalism, and Multi-Musical Prosperity.\\". Finnish Journal of Music Education, 13(1), pp.95-98.  Musical activities  Primarily employed as a professor, Hebert continues to perform as a professional musician in various genres, and teaches a course in songwriting. A jazz trumpeter and classical bass baritone singer, in 2013-2015 he had occasional work as a professional chorus member (Edvard Grieg Kor) with the Bergen Philharmonic Orchestra, Bergen National Opera, and Berlin Philharmonic.(McCollum and Hebert, 2014, p.409) In the 1990s, Hebert performed as singer-songwriter with Portland, Oregon-based alternative rock band Post Impression, which shared stages with The Posies, Heatmiser and Everclear. He later played as a member of Zimbabwean band Maichi Maraire and Kubatana, Seattle-based Cuban salsa band Son de Cinco a Siete, and his own jazz groups. Moving to Tokyo, he performed as trumpeter and vocalist in the duo Jazz de Iitomo with Johnny Todd, jazz pianist/arranger and former bandleader for Don Ho. Together with Todd, he recorded an album for vocalist Midori Takamura and had a few appearances with Mika Todd from hit J-Pop group Minimoni.

The reaction is catalyzed by trifluoroacetic acid or Lewis acids such as ytterbium trifluoromethanesulfonate (Yb(OTf)3). The reaction is named for Paul Grieco, who first reported it in 1985.Larsen, S. D.; Grieco, P. A., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1985, 107, 1768.Greico, P. A.; Bahsas, A. Tetrahedron Lett. 1988, 29, 5855. The reaction process involves the formation of an aryl immonium ion intermediate followed by an aza Diels-Alder reaction with an alkene. Imines are electron-poor, and thus usually function as the dienophile. Here, however, the alkene is electron-rich, so it reacts well with the immonium diene in an Inverse electron-demand Diels‚ÄìAlder reaction. Researchers have extended the Grieco three-component reaction to reactants or catalysts immobilized on solid support, which greatly expands the application of this reaction to various combinatorial chemistry settings. Kielyov and Armstrong were the first to report a solid-supported version of this reaction, they found that this reaction works well for each reactants immobilized on solid support. Kobayashi and co-workers show that a polymer-supported scandium catalyst catalyze the Grieco reaction with high efficiency. Given the effectiveness of the reaction and the commercial availability of various Grieco partners, the Grieco three-component coupling is very useful for preparing quinoline libraries for drug discovery.

History The schloss was established in around 1400 by Wilhelm von Vlatten and was remodeled on numerous occasions over the centuries. The building c. 1860 In the 15th century, the property fell through marriage to Konrad Scheiffart von Merode-Bornheim. Wilhelm Scheiffart von Merode and his wife Agnes von Bylandt enlarged the house in the middle of the 16th century to the West Wing. At the end of the 16th century, the castle fell through marriage to Baron Johann Otto von Gymnich, whose family remained in possession of it until the 19th century. It then passed to Count Wolff- Metternich von Gymnich, and became known for a period as Schloss Gymnich. Just before the Second World War, the schloss was taken over by non-aristocratic owners, and since that time it has repeatedly changed hands. The sculptor R√ºckriem lived and worked here from 1963 to 1971, and several Can albums were recorded here in the late 1960s and early 1970s including Soundtracks and Tago Mago; the band moved out of the castle in late 1971. The building now houses the Museum of European Art. In 1982, the Landesmuseum Bonn excavated the site and unearthed the remains of an earlier fortress, measuring about by and dating to around 1350, and medieval pottery. This earlier structure is believed to have been demolished down to the foundation in 1400 to enable the construction of a new, larger building. Architecture The current two- storey mansion dates to the 18th century, and stands on a high basement. It has a heavy tiled hipped roof and dormers and Gothic brickwork. Around 1950, the greater part of the roof collapsed, and the building underwent extensive restoration. A number of rooms feature richly designed stucco ceilings in the Regency style, with allegorical figures and the arms of the former aristocratic owners commonplace. References  Literature  * K.H.

Early life  Pierre Lassonde was born in St-Hyacinthe, Quebec, the third child of four. He studied at the S√©minaire de Saint-Hyacinthe and graduated in 1967 with a Bachelor of Arts. He then attended the √âcole Polytechnique de Montr√©al, a school affiliated with the University of Montreal, graduating with a B.Sc in Electrical Engineering in 1971. He attended the University of Utah and received his MBA in 1973. He earned his CFA designation in 1983.  Career  After receiving his MBA from the University of Utah, he joined the Mining and Metals Division of Bechtel, based in San Francisco, California. In 1977, he accepted a position in the Strategic Planning Dept. of Rio Algom in Toronto, Ontario. He joined Beutel, Goodman & Company Ltd., a leading Institutional money management firm in 1980 as mining analyst and precious metal portfolio manager. There he managed the very successful Dynamic Gold Fund for a period of 10 years. In 1982, he co- founded, along with his business partner Seymour Schulich, Franco-Nevada Corporation, the first publicly traded gold royalty company. In 1985, Franco- Nevada acquired for US$2 million a royalty on a small mining operation in the heart of the Carlin gold belt of Nevada. Two years later, the property was acquired by Barrick Gold, who discovered the world class Goldstrike deposit. From inception to February 2002 when the company was sold to Newmont Mining for US$3.2billion, Franco-Nevada provided its shareholders a 36% annualized rate of return. Lassonde served as President of Newmont Mining Corp. from February 2002 to 2007 and Vice-Chairman in 2007. In 2008, Lassonde revived Franco-Nevada by joining forces with David Harquail and the rest of the original Franco-Nevada team to acquire Newmont‚Äôs royalty portfolio. The born- again Franco-Nevada became the largest mining IPO (Initial Public Offering) ever offered on the TSE (Toronto Stock Exchange) at that time. Lassonde holds the position of Chairman of the Board of the new Franco-Nevada. The success story continues, as the market capitalization of the company today is more than $17 billion (August 2018)https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/quote/fnv.to?ltr=1. In 1993, Lassonde led a group of investors in another start-up, Metallica Resources. The company was responsible for the discovery of the world-class El Morro deposit in Chile and the Cerro San Pedro mine in Mexico. In 2010, Metallica merged with Peak Gold and Newgold and later on with Western Goldfields Resources to create a leading mid-size gold-producing company. Lassonde is a leading shareholder and Director of the company. In 1995, Lassonde led another group of investors in the startup of Enghouse Systems Ltd, a provider of software to the telecommunication companies. The company had revenue of $220 million in fiscal 2014 and net income of $29.7 million. He is the second-largest shareholder and a Director of the company. The company is listed on the TSX and has a market capitalization of over $1.2B. Lassonde served as Chairman of the World Gold Council from 2005 to 2009. In addition, Lassonde authored in 1990 The Gold Book: The Complete Investment Guide to Precious Metals.  Philanthropy  Lassonde is an active and engaged philanthropist in both Canada and the United States in the fields of education, the arts and the community in which he lives.

A multifaceted musician, Brauneis instructed students in many musical subjects, including composition, conducting, guitar, harp, organ, piano, violin, voice, and theory. Considered Canada's first native musician to be trained in Europe, he was a highly influential teacher and figure in the classical music scene in 19th century Montreal. His most well known composition, The Royal Welcome Waltzes (1869), is still performed in concert and was recorded on disc by Symphony Nova Scotia in 1987. Life and career Born in Quebec City, Brauneis was the son of composer and bandmaster Jean-Chrysostome Brauneis I. He began his studies with his father, but went on to become the first native born Canadian to study music in Europe, where he resided from 1830-1833. After returning to Canada, he served as organist at Notre-Dame Church from 1833-1844, and then in the same position at Saint-Jacques Cathedral until 1857 when he was succeeded by Romain-Octave Pelletier I. In 1837 he founded the short lived 'Soci√©t√© de Musique', Montreal's first music society. For more than 30 years, Brauneis taught music at the Congregation of Notre Dame of Montreal in addition to teaching privately and at other schools. He began his teaching career teaching piano and organ, introducing his students to the great classical composers and the piano studies of Muzio Clementi, Johann Baptist Cramer, and Carl Czerny. In 1842 he began teaching singing, offering vocal lessons in the tradition of the German school of singing. He also taught lessons in guitar, harp, and violin performance in addition to giving instruction in music theory and composition. He also led a band in Montreal and worked as a piano tuner and seller of imported instruments. As a composer, Brauneis wrote mainly symphonic works, dances, and pieces for the piano and organ. His 1835 Mass with orchestral accompaniment was positively received with a complimentary review in La Minerve on 12 July 1835. In 1848 the publishing company Lovell & Gibson published his Marche de la St. Jean Baptiste and his The Montreal Bazaar Polka. In 1849 his The Monklands Polka was published by both Dubois Publishers and by Mead Brothers Publishers. In 1869 he self-published his most enduring work, The Royal Welcome Waltzes; a series of waltzes named after Canadian cities which are dedicated to Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn. Three of these waltzes were later published by the Canadian Musical Heritage Society in their first volume of Canadian music. Brauneis died in Montreal in 1871 at the age of 57.

Alpentore during the W√ºrm glaciation  Murnauer Moos with its alpentor During the W√ºrm glaciation, where several glaciers from different Alpine valleys met or flowed through narrow passages at the edge of the Alps, ice was piled up. Such bottlenecks had a significant impact on the level of the ice sheet which meant that it eventually flowed over low mountain passes and ridges and the glaciers were combined into a network of ice streams. Alpentore, through which particularly large masses of ice poured into the surrounding plains, were mainly located at the mouths of large longitudinal valleys such as Inn, Rhine or Salzach valleys. These glaciers penetrated up to 50 kilometres into the lowlands. Even valleys that appear rather insignificant today such as those of the Isar, Loisach and Ammer rivers, were able to produce large tongues of ice when their glaciers were fed by larger ones, such as the Inn Valley Glacier (e.g. via the Fern Pass). By contrast with such large glaciers, quite isolated valleys, such as those of the Iller or the Lech, could only produce much smaller glacial tongues. A further prerequisite for glaciers extending into the Alpine foreland are high mountains. East of the Salzach, glacier tongues hardly reached the edge of the Alps, because the mountains of the Low Tauern, unlike those of the High Tauern did not produce enough ice. So the alpentore were found mainly in the Bavarian Alpine Foreland. One of the few examples at the southern edge of the Alps was the comparatively small alpentor of today's Tagliamento valley.  Examples of Inn valley glaciers  The Walchensee In the Inn Valley (towards Rosenheim) the Inn Glacier was forced between the Wildbarren and the Kranzhorn at a height of about .

At the Walchensee and Kochelsee lakes a tributary of the Inn Glacier pushed through over the Kesselberg at a height of 1,400 m between the Jochberg and the Herzogstand. The Loisach Glacier, another tributary, flowed between the Wank and the Kramerspitz near Garmisch at a height of about 1,700 m. In present-day Murnau the ice stream reached a height of 1,200 m.

It is the highest peak of the range named after it, the Reichenspitze Group, and offers good, all-round views. Its neighbouring peaks, all linked by ar√™tes, are the 3,263-metre-high Gabler to the northeast, the Richterspitze (3,052 m) to the south and the 3,278-metre-high Wildgerlosspitze to the northwest.  First ascent  The mountain was first ascended in 1856 by a farmer from Prettau in the valley of Tauferer Ahrntal, whose name has been lost. He climbed from the southeast up the east face, a route that, today, is assessed near the summit as climbing grade UIAA III. The first touristic ascent took place on 16 July 1865 by Peter Haller from Gm√ºnd and foresters, Anton Peer and Josef Unterrainer of Sch√∂nachtal.Zeitschrift des Deutschen und Oesterreichischen Alpenvereins, Munich, 1870/71, Abteilung I, p. 113  Routes  An ascent of the summit may be launched from the Plauener Hut (2,373 m), the Richter Hut (2,374 m) or the Zittauer Hut (2,328 m).

The song was written by Madonna, Martin Kierszenbaum, Natalia Keery-Fisher, Mike Dean, Kanye West and Tommy Brown. It was produced by Madonna, Dean and West, with Charlie Heat serving as co-producer. The demo of \\"Holy Water\\" leaked on to the internet in late December 2014 and the final version leaked in February 2015, a month prior to the album's release. \\"Holy Water\\" is an electronica and technopop song, and it features minimalist bass stutter, ricocheting synths and \\"martial beats\\" in its instrumentation. Lyrically, the song talks about cunnilingus, where Madonna compares her vaginal fluids to holy water, juxtaposing Christian imagery with sexuality. \\"Holy Water\\" divided music critics; some deemed it a standout and one of the most scandalous tracks of Madonna's career, while others felt it was embarrassing and over the top. The song was included on the set list of her Rebel Heart Tour (2015‚Äì16). The performance contained dancers dressed as nuns, the singer gyrating around the cross while standing on a dancer and a reenactment of the Last Supper. It was target of controversies in Singapore, where Madonna excluded it from the setlist and was criticized by the Catholic Church.  Background and release  Natalia Kills (pictured) co- wrote \\"Holy Water\\" with Madonna. While working on Rebel Heart, Madonna enlisted a range of composers and producers to work with her. On April 9, 2014, she uploaded a picture of herself on her Instagram with Natalia Kills and Martin Kierszenbaum, hinting that they were working in some songs for the album, by posting: \\"Working the midnight shift with Natalia Kills. 2 girls on a couch... don't it taste like Holy Water? #artforfreedom #rebelheart #revolutionoflove\\". In the picture, Madonna was seen sitting with Kills in front of two microphones, and as noted by Keith Caulfield of Billboard, \\"[i]n the foreground is Martin Kierszenbaum, the founder and chairman of Cherrytree Records and senior executive of A&R; for Interscope Records\\". In an interview for Paper, Kills revealed that Madonna's dancers used to play Kills' songs during their rehearsals and workouts every week, which interested Madonna to collaborate with her. Together they wrote eight songs in one week, with Kills commenting about Madonna: \\"She writes incredible lyrics, sings beautiful melodies, but most of all she is so fucking funny\\". Later, Madonna played a lot of her unfinished songs from Rebel Heart for Kanye West, who agreed to work with the singer and ended up co-producing three of the songs on the record, including \\"Holy Water\\". On December 17, 2014, thirteen unfinished demos from Madonna's then-upcoming album leaked online, prompting the singer to rush-release six tracks from the album on the iTunes Store upon pre-order of the album three days later. A week later, over 14 new demos leaked online; among them \\"Holy Water\\" was also present. Later, on February 3, 2015, more than a month ahead of the album's release date, the finished version of the song leaked online.  Recording and composition  \\"Holy Water\\" was written by Madonna, Martin Kierszenbaum, Natalia Keery-Fisher, Mike Dean, Kanye West and Tommy Brown. It was produced by Madonna, Dean and West, and co-produced by Charlie Heat. Dean was also responsible for keyboards, drum programming, engineering and mixing. Demacio \\"Demo\\" Castellon also contributed to the track's engineering and mixing. \\"Holy Water\\" is an electronica and technopop song, and it features \\"a minimalist bass burble\\", \\"martial beats\\", and ricocheting synths in its instrumentation. \\"Holy Water\\" interpolates her own song \\"Vogue\\" during the track's bridge, with the singer commending \\"strike a pose\\" over a rhythmic base. She also offers \\"orgasmic gasps\\" throughout the track. Lyrically, the song talks about worshiping cunnilingus, with Madonna comparing oral sex to holy water, and as noted by Billboard Vanessa Grigoriadis, it was named after her lifelong obsessions, since it features \\"church-baiting innuendos,\\" \\"juxtaposing Christian imagery with frank sexuality\\". During the spoken chorus, she sings: \\"Kiss it better, kiss it better/ Make it better, make it wetter\\", and later she speaks, \\"If you like it please confess / Bless yourself and genuflect\\". In the hook, she claims: \\"Don't it taste like holy water?\\", before clarifying: \\"Yeezus loves my pussy best\\". Adam R. Holz of Plugged In noted that the song \\"finds Madonna returning to her longstanding habit of sexing up spiritual imagery\\".  Critical reception  Madonna standing on a dancer while twirling on a cross during the performance of \\"Holy Water\\" on the Rebel Heart Tour. \\"Holy Water\\" divided music critics. Spencer Kornhaber of The Atlantic called it \\"easily the catchiest moment of the album.\\" Annie Zaleski of The A.V. Club wrote that the track is a highlight, \\"a stern, grayscale technopop team-up with Natalia Kills.\\" Writing in The National, author Saeed Saeed named it \\"the most scandalous Madonna track this decade\\", declaring that \\"[t]he brooding bass- filled verse gives way to a poptastic chorus that uses hedonistic sound effects harking back to her 1990 'Justify My Love.'\\" Bradley Stern of MuuMuse also found it to be \\"the most shocking moment of sexploitation\\", declaring: \\"blasphemy has truly never tasted sweeter.\\" The Daily Telegraphs Andy Gill noted that the song \\"manages to be sacrilegious and ear-burningly naughty.\\" While reviewing Rebel Heart in Time Out, Nick Levine called it \\"a brilliantly ridiculous hymn to cunnilingus\\", where Madonna manages to \\"alternate between showing off, getting off and taking stock.\\" Amy Pettifer of The Quietus praised the track for being \\"rich with Nicki vibes, without Nicki actually making a second appearance\\", claiming: \\"Sex has always been one of M's favourite subjects, particularly when it's hand in daring hand with religion; here she performs a kind of erotic baptism while a Moroder-esque bass underscores her sermon. It's one of many strong choruses that take you somewhere unexpected.\\" She also praised the \\"Vogue\\" sample and defined the track as a \\"cunning turn from the Holy Madonna and Baby Yeezus.\\" Kyle Anderson of Entertainment Weekly wrote that Madonna sells the song, due to \\"the bass gurgles that remind[ed him] of classic Massive Attack or the reference to 'Vogue.'\\" PopMatterss Evan Sawdey enjoyed the sense of dirty fun that permeates \\"Holy Water\\", writing that \\"Madonna sounds very much at home with aggressive sentiments like 'Bitch, get off my pole' and 'Yeezus loves my pussy best', blatantly toying around with religious iconography while having a bit of provocative fun.\\" He also found the \\"Vogue\\" sample \\"a rare case of Madonna acknowledging her own legacy.\\" Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine noted that the song is \\"a welcome bit of percolating electronica\\". Cinquemani commended the inclusion of the word \\"genuflect\\" in a pop song, but also felt that \\"Madonna's Catholic baiting [is] like a reflex at this point\\". The reviewer believed that Madonna deliberately included provocative lyrics in the song, either to bring back her persona Dita Parlo from her 1992 studio album Erotica, or just to make a statement \\"about women of a certain age unapologetically flexing their libidos\\". Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic called it a \\"detour\\", where Madonna \\"indulge[s] in both Erotica-era taboo-busting sleaze.\\" Ben Kelly wrote in Attitude that he felt the song was \\"a little reductive\\". John Marrs of Gay Times agreed, calling it \\"a bit embarrassing and reductive.\\" In her review of the album, The Guardians Kitty Empire labelled it a silly track that \\"maintain[s] the long-term narrative of Catholic-poking that runs through Madonna's libidinous oeuvre.\\" Lewis Corner of Digital Spy opined that the track is \\"frustrating because the production is sharp and offers some of the most interesting moments on the album, but the overtly sexual lyrics feel like forced shock value. [...] Of course, shocking the audience is Madonna's business, but here it feels more crass than clever.\\" Writing for Billboard, Joe Levy defined it as \\"some of the most absurdly lubricious sex songs of her absurdly lubricious career.\\" In August 2018, Billboard picked it as the singer's 83rd greatest song, calling it \\"a revved up version of her seductive Erotica-era bedroom romps [...] Only Madonna could make blasphemy taste this good\\". Caryn Ganz of Rolling Stone called it an \\"over-the-top sex song\\" and a \\"cringy track.\\" In his review of Rebel Heart, Mark Lore from Paste said that the song \\"fail[s] to reach the more restrained sexiness of 'Justify My Love'.\\" Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune was more critical, writing that in \\"Holy Water\\" Madonna \\"conflates religion and erotica for the 3,243rd time in [her] career.\\"  Live performance  mashup performance of \\"Holy Water\\" and \\"Vogue\\" on the Rebel Heart Tour. \\"Holy Water\\" was included on the set list of Madonna's Rebel Heart Tour (2015‚Äì2016) as part of the first segment. For the performance, her dancers were dressed as nuns in hot pants, bikini tops and high-heeled boots, and it also features \\"grinding, lingerie and priests\\". During the middle of the performance, Madonna \\"gyrate[s] alongside pole- dancing\\", straddling and writhing a dancer dressed as a nun. She also performed parts of \\"Vogue\\" (1990) near the end of the performance. For the finale, Madonna reenacted the Last Supper and portrayed an orgy onstage with the dancers, one of them dressed as Jesus Christ. The performance of the song at the March 19‚Äì20, 2016 shows in Sydney's Allphones Arena was recorded and released in the singer's fifth live album, Rebel Heart Tour. The performance of \\"Holy Water\\" polarized reviewers. Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph named it \\"inarguably another fantastic display of showbiz shock and awe from a mistress of the form.\\" Jon Pareles of The New York Times named it \\"the show's blasphemy quota\\", while Michael Hamersly of Miami Herald called it an \\"over- the-top\\" performance. Jordan Zivitz of The Montreal Gazette opined: \\"Twenty- six years after 'Like a Prayer' video scandalized the Vatican and parents who relied on MTV as a cheap babysitter, the sight of dancers twisting down steel crucifixes while Madonna snapped 'bitch, get off my pole' in 'Holy Water' was hopefully intended to be comical\\". During the Asian-leg of the tour in Singapore, Madonna was banned from performing \\"Holy Water\\" by the Media Development Authority (MDA) due to the \\"sexually explicit\\" and \\"religiously sensitive\\" nature of the act. A spokesperson from the MDA stated: \\"In determining the rating, MDA had carefully reviewed the proposed set list and consulted the Arts Consultative Panel. Religiously sensitive content which breached our guidelines, such as the song 'Holy Water', will thus not be performed in Singapore\\". The concert organizers wanted to comply with their R18 rating and remove any content or material offending race or religion. Other songs such as \\"Iconic\\" and \\"Devil Pray\\" were also removed from the set list.  Credits and personnel  =Management= *Webo Girl Publishing, Inc.

Public defenders are full-time attorneys employed by the state or federal governments. The public defender program is one of several types of criminal legal aid in the United States. Background and history Prior to the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution, legal aid was accessible only to those who had the ability to pay. During that time, people who were not able to pay for an attorney usually did not have access to one. The Sixth Amendment changed this concept that only those who had money had the right to an attorney. The Sixth Amendment reads: > In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy > and public trial, by an impartial jury of the state and district wherein the > crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously > ascertained by law, and to be informed of the nature and cause of the > accusation; to be confronted with the witnesses against him; to have > compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to have the > assistance of counsel for his defense. One of the listed rights granted and guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment is the right to counsel; the right for defendants, who are on trial for criminal charges, to have legal aid in federal courts. The Sixth Amendment's right to counsel is for criminal cases only; it is not for civil cases or charges that do not carry a risk of imprisonment. Although the Sixth Amendment introduced the right to counsel in the United States, the Supreme Court would further interpret and expand on this right. =Supreme Court rulings=  Powell v. Alabama, 287 U.S. 45 (1932)  In 1931 in Scottsboro, Alabama nine black youths, the \\"Scottsboro Boys\\", were placed on trial after two young white women claimed they were raped by the young black men. The day of their trial, the \\"Scottsboro Boys\\" were not appointed counsel by the judge and were instead represented by two unqualified people: a real estate agent from Tennessee and an old attorney who had not practiced law in many years. Both legal representatives of the \\"Scottsboro Boys\\" had very little information and knowledge about the situation but did not attempt to push back the trial. Every \\"Scottsboro Boy\\", except for one, was sentenced to death despite the fact the doctors who checked the two young women did not find any proof of rape. The case was appealed but reaffirmed by the State Supreme Court and then appealed again. The case eventually climbed to and caught the eyes and attention of the Supreme Court of the United States in 1932. In a vote from 7-2, the Supreme Court overruled the conviction of the \\"Scottsboro Boys\\", stating that trial denied the due process and the equal protection clauses granted by the Fourteenth Amendment to the nine men by denying them the right to counsel granted by the Sixth Amendment. The Supreme Court also ruled that, under the Fourteenth Amendment, the federal and state governments are to give legal counsel for capital crimes, crimes that can result in the death penalty, if the defendant is unable to afford their own private attorneys. This ruling expanded the interpretation of the Sixth Amendment and applied the rights of the Sixth Amendment to the states, not just the federal government, as well.  Betts v. Brady, 316 U.S. 455 (1942)  The Betts v. Brady case narrowed the interpretation and the understanding that came about from the Powell v. Alabama case. In 1941, a 43-year old man by the name of Betts was arrested for stealing in the state of Maryland. Betts requested for an attorney, as he lacked the means to do so himself, but his request was denied by the court on the grounds that appointments were only granted to those on trial for capital crimes forcing him to represent himself. Betts was found guilty but attempted to appeal, arguing that the courts refusal to give him an attorney violated rights granted to him in the Fifth and Sixth Amendment such as the right to counsel. He argued that the court's refusal to grant him an attorney was in direct violation to the Supreme Court's decision from Powell v. Alabama. The Supreme Court, by a 6-3 decision, supported Betts' conviction. Associate Justice Owen Roberts, the writer of the Supreme Court's opinion on this case, stated that the precedent set from Powell v. Alabama of appointing legal counsel was not set in stone due to the fact that there are different scenarios where something can appear to be unfair in one situation but not in another. He argued that in Powell v. Alabama, the legal counsel was necessary because the trial itself was prejudiced. Roberts also stated that the concept of appointing counsel was not required for every case by the states. The Court argued that the right to counsel was not one of the fundamental rights protected by the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. Ultimately, this ruling would allow the States freedom to decide when to grant the indigent defender legal counsel. The implications of the Supreme Court's decision of this case would last until the Supreme Court case Gideon v. Wainwright in 1963.  Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335 (1963)  The case Gideon v. Wainwright was a landmark case that would set the precedent on how legal counsel would work in the United States. In 1961, a burglary occurred in a poolroom in Florida and a man named Clarence Earl Gideon was arrested by the police on the basis of an eyewitness's testimony. Gideon requested for legal counsel to the courts as he was unable to afford a lawyer however, at the time, Florida only allowed appointed counsel for capital crimes, not lesser crimes like breaking and entering, and thus his request was denied. Florida's system was brought about by the previous Supreme Court Case Betts v. Brady, which allowed states to decide on their own when to offer indigent defense. Gideon was forced to defend himself; despite his hard work, he ended up being sentenced to prison for five years. Gideon petitioned the Supreme Court on the grounds that he was not provided counsel and thus was denied him of his rights granted by the Fifth and Sixth Amendments of the United States Constitution and therefore, he was imprisoned on unconstitutional grounds. The Supreme Court unanimously ruled that the denial of Gideon's request for a lawyer was unconstitutional and that the Sixth Amendment grants the defendant the right to an attorney even if the defendant is unable to pay for one. The Courts ruled that states were required to provide lawyers on the grounds that having lawyers to defend defendants were a necessity. Justice Black, the writer of the Court's opinion, stated: > Even the intelligent and educated layman has small and sometimes no skill in > the science of law. If charged with crime, he is incapable, generally, of > determining for himself whether the indictment is good or bad. He is > unfamiliar with the rules of evidence. Left without the aid of counsel, he > may be put on trial without a proper charge, and convicted upon incompetent > evidence, or evidence irrelevant to the issue or otherwise inadmissible. He > lacks both the skill and knowledge adequately to prepare his defense, even > though he have a perfect one. He requires the guiding hand of counsel at > every step in the proceedings against him. Without it, though he be not > guilty, he faces the danger of conviction because he does not know how to > establish his innocence. Justice Black's opinion showed a similar argument that that of the Court's from Powell v. Alabama, the guiding hand of counsel can prevent an innocent man from being imprisoned falsely. From this point on, all defendants on trial for criminal charges were guaranteed the right to a lawyer, no matter what their financial situation looks like. The Court's decision in this case overturned the previous understanding of legal counsel set by the Court in Betts v. Brady. Gideon v. Wainwright would be the catalyst for the wave of change in criminal justice that the 1950s and 1960s would experience.  Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984)  The Supreme Court case Strickland v. Washington changed the way people interpret the Sixth Amendment by stating that the legal counsel provided to defendants should be reasonably effective. Strickland was placed on trial for murder charges in the state of Florida and was sentenced to death. Strickland appealed to the Supreme Court justice on the grounds that his counsel did not fulfill his duty on grounds such as not seeking a psychiatric exam despite the fact Strickland pleaded emotional issues. The Supreme Court ruled 8-1 that effective legal counsel is a right but in order to prove the counsel is ineffective, the defendant needs to prove (1) their lawyer's performance was below a certain standard and (2) there is a chance that if it was not for the ineffectiveness, a different result could have occurred. =Birth of the public defender= Although there had been some provisions for legal counsel for the indigent population prior to Gideon, Gideon served as the catalyst for a wave of change. Following the landmark 1963 decision, the 1960s witnessed the creation of programs across the country to make this right to counsel available to most people charged with crimes who could not afford an attorney to represent them. California's first female attorney, Clara Shortridge Foltz, came up with the idea of the public defender. Foltz was growing concerned with the prosecutors in court, feeling that they served themselves, and believed in the creation of a rival that would mirror the prosecutor, just as qualified but instead of searching for guilt, searching for innocence. Foltz was also inspired by the people she represented in court such as Charles Colby who lamented over spending all that he owned on ineffective legal counsel. She proposed this, at the time, radical idea of the public defender system at the 1893 Chicago World's Fair as well as wrote numerous law articles on the reasoning why the costs of the criminal defendant should be shouldered by the government. One memorable quote from her speech at the Chicago World fair was: > For the conviction of the accused every weapon is provided and used, even > those poisoned by wrong and injustice. But what machinery is provided for > the defense of the innocent? None, absolutely none. Despite the fact that provisions for indigent legal defense did exist before the creation of the public defender program, Foltz argued the lawyers appointed were unqualified in comparison to the public prosecutors. In fact, she believed that the public defender should be created as a mirror to the public prosecutor; she wished for the selection and the salary to be the same. Her goal of seeing this idea come to fruition saw success when the state of California would see the first public defender office of the United States open in the city of Los Angeles in 1913. Following the creation of the Los Angeles Public Defender office, the public defender program and idea spread throughout the nation. =Alternate indigent defense systems= The public defender system is not the only form of indigent defense program offered in the United States. Besides the public defender system, there are two other main alternatives: assigned-counsel system and contract-service system. Assigned-counsel is where the court appoints a private lawyer to defend someone who cannot afford to pay. Contract-service is where an attorney is contracted to work for a period of time. These three forms are usually mixed and matched together in different ways in different states. For instance, most states usually use both assigned-counsel and the public defender program side by side. Assigned counsel is usually used when the public defender program is overexerted in the number of cases they have to process or if there is a legal issue of conflict of interest in a case. State systems In some US states, the office is not titled as \\"Public Defender\\"; for example, Kentucky's public defender office is called the Department of Public Advocacy. =Structure= Public defender agencies of all kinds are supported by public funding, but are ethically bound to be independent and do not take direction from the government as to the acceptance or handling of cases, or to the hiring of staff attorneys. One of the most well established statewide public defender systems is in Wisconsin. The Wisconsin State Public Defender has been used as a model for other states and several countries. Wisconsin has a program that uses both staff attorneys and appointments to attorneys in private practice. State public defender systems can vary widely from state to state, county to county, and from federal defender organizations. Most chief public defenders are appointed. The chief public defenders in Florida, Tennessee, Lincoln, Nebraska, and San Francisco are elected. Defenders vary greatly regarding the types of support staff they employ to support the work of their attorneys. In addition to clerical staff, defender offices may employ investigators, social workers, and forensic experts, such as psychologists. These human resources may help defenders provide more professional service than an appointed lawyer without this type of staff or funds to employ them. Private appointed attorneys are entitled to apply to the court for the services of an expert or investigator and the government is required to pay for those services if they are essential to the defense of the accused person. =Pay= In jurisdictions where indigent defense is handled on the basis of contracts or ad-hoc appointments, there has been increasing concern about the low pay and minimal resources given to public defenders. In jurisdictions where the public defender is a government agency, public defenders are generally on the same or similar pay-scale to prosecutors. This rate of pay is generally below that of the private sector. In jurisdictions without an organized public defender agency, some courts and legislatures in some states tend to \\"cap\\" the amount a panel attorney who does not work for a public defender receives. =Practice= Entry level public defenders can be hired straight out of their third year of law school. State public defenders and state prosecutors typically begin their careers handling criminal cases on the misdemeanor level and work closely with a supervising attorneys on their more complex cases. Full-time state public defenders typically handle felony and misdemeanor criminal cases. Many staff attorneys belong to unions. In Florida, staff attorneys have no civil service protections. In US civil cases (e.g., personal injury or a landlord-tenant dispute), public defenders may be appointed in civil cases that are quasi-criminal in nature (e.g., removal of children from parents and civil commitments for alleged sexually violent predators)See, e.g., Lassiter v. Dep't of Social Services, 452 U.S. 18, 101 S. Ct. 2153, 68 L. Ed. 2d. 640 (1981). or in highly unusual situations where the civil proceedings may be highly connected to criminal proceedings;See, e.g., Yarbrough v. Superior Court, 39 Cal. 3d 197, 702 P.2d 583, 216 Cal. Rptr. 425 (1985). otherwise indigent litigants are referred to a legal aid office. In the early 2000s, a new form of practice, pioneered at The Bronx Defenders and known as \\"holistic defense\\" (or \\"holistic advocacy\\") has emerged.Michael Pinard, Broadening the Holistic Mindset: Incorporating Collateral Consequences and Reentry into Criminal Defense Lawyering. Fordham Urban Law Journal. Volume 31, Issue 4, Article 7 (2003).The Bronx DefendersRobin Steinberg, Beyond Lawyering: How Holistic Representation Makes for Good Policy, Better Lawyers, and More Satisfied Clients. 30 N.Y.U. Rev. L. & Soc. Change 625 (2006) Holistic Defense is characterized by four pillars: 1) Seamless access to legal and nonlegal services that meet client needs; 2) Dynamic, interdisciplinary communication; 3) Advocates with an interdisciplinary skill set; 4) A robust understanding of, and connection to, the community served.http://www.holisticdefense.org Federal public defenders =Structure= Federal Public Defender offices follow one of two models. The first model, the Federal Public Defender, is a federal agency which operates under the Judicial Branch of the federal government, specifically administered by the Administrative Office of the United States Courts. However, they perform administrative and budgetary duties as only the circuit courts of appeals of the United States are in charge of appointing their respective Federal Defenders, who in turn hire lawyers and support staff and manage the office. This model is followed separately for each individual judicial district in their circuit. The procedures for appointment, re-appointment and other administrative matters vary from circuit to circuit but the Federal Public Defender is appointed for a four-year term. The second model is that of the community defender. Although similar to a federal public defender, technically it is actually a corporation that receives federal grant money and acts more independently from the federal judiciary. Although both type of defender offices are supported by public funding, they do not take direction from the government as to the operation of the offices. Federal Public Defender offices are customarily located in larger metropolitan areas, but serve clients throughout their assigned area. =Practice= The Office of the Federal Public Defender operates under authority of the Criminal Justice Act of 1964 (CJA),18 U.S.C. ¬ß 3006A. It provides defense services in federal criminal cases to individuals who are financially unable to obtain adequate representation. A person's eligibility for defender services is determined by the federal court. Defender organization attorneys may not engage in the private practice of law. Those accused who are found to be indigent in jurisdictions without a Federal or Community Defender, and those for whom there is a conflict or those charged at a time the Defender in their jurisdiction is short staffed or has a full caseload, will be appointed private counsel who are paid an hourly rate from an approved list of qualified lawyers who have the requisite experience to handle a federal criminal case. A federal defender's case load is usually substantially lower than her or his state counterpart's. While a state public defender may have to juggle over one hundred cases, an Assistant Federal Public Defender routinely has 30-50 cases, though the severity and complexity of such cases may be greater. The federal system has over 4,000 separate offenses, and uses a very mechanistic, sentencing scheme based on a set of \\"advisory\\" sentencing guidelines. =Pay= By law, lawyers employed by Federal Public Defender offices have salaries set to match those of lawyers in the U.S. Attorney's office. The combination of salary, benefits and support team tends to attract, and more importantly retain, highly qualified attorneys. Especially in more rural areas, where federal criminal work is considered well-paid, many federal defenders have risen up through the state systems before becoming federal defenders. Legal issues =Conflict of interest= Because conflict of interest problems could exist where multiple defendants participated in a single crime, only one person in a group of co-defendants will be assigned an attorney from a public defender office. For many defendants, it is in their best interest to testify against co-defendants in exchange for a reduced sentence. To ensure that each defendant is afforded his constitutional right to an effective defense, jurisdictions may have several public defender entities, or a \\"conflict panel\\" of private practice attorneys. This enables the court to assign each defendant an attorney from a completely separate office, thereby guarding against the risk of one client's privileged information accidentally falling into the hands of another client's attorney. Some jurisdictions, like in Los Angeles County, employ a separate entity for legal representation called the Alternate Public Defender's office. Any further conflicts are handled by court-appointed private attorneys. =Appeals= Notably, the landmark Gideon case only gives an indigent criminal defendant a right to be represented at trial and upon the first appeal as of right. But the Supreme Court has held that there is no right to representation for discretionary appealsRoss v. Moffitt, . or post-conviction collateral attacks like habeas corpus and coram nobis.Murray v. Giarratano, . In other words, an indigent convicted criminal who loses his trial and first appeal of right, if one is available (one state, Virginia, does not even allow an appeal of right), is on his own afterwards. Upon review of the trial court record, an appellate public defender may conclude there are no reasonable or valid grounds for an appeal. Such a conclusion creates a conflict between the duty to diligently represent the client (and honor their right to a first appeal), and the duty to the court to refrain from filing frivolous appeals. In 2000, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld as constitutional the so-called Wende appellate procedure implemented by California to resolve this dilemma.Smith v. Robbins, . The appellate public defender files an opening brief summarizing the procedural and factual history of the case, indicates that he has explained his evaluation of the case to his client and told the client of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, asks that the court independently examine the record for arguable issues, and expresses his availability to argue any issues on which the court desires briefing. However, the appellate brief never expressly indicates that the appeal is frivolous, though the implicit message is obvious. The California Court of Appeal then undertakes its own review of the record. If it finds a possible issue, it directs the parties to brief and argue it. If it finds none, it issues an opinion (usually unpublished) affirming the conviction.  Controversy and ethical issues  The public defender office and position is not without controversy. The public defender position as well as the rights to counsel is reliant on the decisions of the Supreme Court. As Betts v. Brady and Gideon v. Wainwright demonstrated, when Supreme Court overturned their decision of the states having the ability to choose situations when to grant or not to grant legal counsel, the decisions of the Supreme Court can overturn previous notions of the Sixth Amendment. Controversy also arises from people questioning the essential nature of the public defender role and office as there are those who question why the government should fund and support the legal defense of those who they are putting on trial to begin with. In fact, this controversy dates back to 1897: The New York Daily Tribune found it \\"a ridiculous thing for the State to prosecute with one hand and defend with the other the violation of its own statutes\\". The number of public defenders, their salary and other issues related to public defenders have been controversial. Eric Holder, the United States Attorney General in 2013, phrased the current issues of the public defender system as a state of crisis and saw the current system as a failure to uphold the Sixth Amendment as well as Gideon. The public defenders, especially the State appointed ones, have to deal with numerous issues with respect to excessive caseloads and low salaries. In particular, low salaries can discourage or fail to attract the best legal talent and can also lead to problems retaining experienced attorneys. A good example of such an issue is when Louisiana public defenders were so underfunded, had such a large shortage, and had a huge excessive workload that the office was forced to put defendants in need of a public defender on a waiting list. One example of public awareness of these issues is the film Lethal Weapon 4, which features a humorous version of the Miranda warning in which the humor comes at public defenders' expense. Excessive workload appears to be an issue as well. According to a study by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, 73% of the county offices in the United States went over the recommended maximum limit of cases. In Missouri, a study reported that the state required 270 more public defenders just to represent the indigent at a barely acceptable manner. Controversies can also arise from the idea of how much public defenders should be paid as if they are paid too low, they are underfunded and overworked and struggle to keep and bring people, but paying too much to try to match private sectors is unreasonable as this funding has to come from somewhere, such as Louisiana using police tickets and fines to help fund their public defense system. If they are paid too much, the question arises, who loses out. Other than that, ethical issues and dilemma form as people question whether the defendant is receiving the effective counsel that Strickland interpreted from the Sixth Amendment. In fact, the excessive caseloads for the public defenders results in many defendants calling their defender a \\"dump truck\\", complaining that they feel as if the defender is just trying to dump them rather than actually try to defend them. The complaints against public defenders has led to distrust of the public defender system and the California Court of Appeals even describes how families are selling all they own in order to try to get a private attorney, something that Foltz has attempted to prevent when she came with the idea of the public defender program. Another issue that arises from the lower numbers of public defenders is that the government is forced to rely on alternatives to the public defender system such as private lawyers appointed by the courts. In federal courts, 75 percent of the defendants rely on appointed lawyers especially when the public defender offices have issues with conflict of interest which can be caused by public defender shortages. From studies such as the Rand study, the court appointed private lawyers usually result in higher prison rates as well as higher prison time compared to that of the public defenders. For instance, studies showed that court appointed lawyers had clients with imprisonment times 8 months longer, on average, to the clients who had public defenders. The controversy arises from results of Supreme Court Cases such as Strickland v. Washington as some question if the legal counsel provided is effective as the Supreme Court argued effective counsel was guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment. The question also arises, in this scenario, if this is even ethical. Ethical issues in these terms have become so problematic that the United States Department of Justice was forced to research on constitutional violations in representation. Controversy also exists over the idea of representing the guilty. Mayer Goldman, back in the heydays of the public defender program, questioned what should happen if the public defender represents a guilty defendant. In fact, Harvard Law School's Guide for Careers in Indigent Defense, emphasizes the importance of having to get over the emotion and frustration of having to defend the guilty. Issues over the feeling of defending the guilty is something that people view differently. Disagreement in the federal appellate courts has arisen over the issue of whether a defendant's sentence may be increased because they lied in order to become eligible for a court-appointed attorney.Doyle, Charles. \\"Fibbing to Get a Lawyer: Circuits Split on Punishment.\\" Washington, DC: Congressional Research Service, November 27, 2017.

He was a leader in the Three-Self Patriotic Movement (TSPM) after 1949. Education and discovery of mass singing While in middle school Liu converted to Christianity and soon became a student secretary (organizer) for the Shanghai YMCA. He attended University of Shanghai, a Baptist missionary institution, where he did not receive formal musical training but sang in the university church choir. He graduated in 1932 with a degree in sociology. He then took a position with the Chinese National YMCA. China did not have a tradition of group singing, but Christian church congregations and mission student groups had begun to use music as an attraction as early as the 19th century. When Liu happened upon Music United People, a book of songs, he was moved to form singing groups as a way of promoting patriotism and moral virtue. Liu declared ‚ÄúMy plan was to make music the possession of all and not the privilege of the few.‚Äù In February 1935, with encouragement from the YMCA, Liu established a mass singing club for some sixty clerks, doorkeepers, office boys, elevator operators, and apprentices. Within a week, the number of participants had nearly tripled, and by mid-1936 the group, known as the People‚Äôs Song Association, had attracted more than 1,000 members, with regional branches in Hong Kong and Guangzhou. Mass singing and resistance to Japan Liu wrote in 1935 :If we Chinese want to break free of imperialism‚Äôs iron shackles..., if we want China to exert itself, our people must be able to loudly and vigorously sing powerful songs full of spirit and vitality. If the people of China can sing these songs, no doubt the sound will shake the earth. Any youth who can sing should spread the ‚Äúpeople‚Äôs song‚Äù movement to each province, city, county, and countryside. The dawning of a new China will arrive when all the people of China can sing these majestic and powerful songs.quoted in Howard (2014). In June 1936 Liu stood on a two-meter high platform in a sports arena in Shanghai packed with thousands to lead a several hundred member chorus in \\"The March of the Volunteers, \\" a patriotic song which after 1949 became the national anthem. Mass singing became even more widespread as it proved its ability to mobilize patriotic support for the government following the Xi'an Incident of December 1936. Liu leads a YMCA Patriotic Youth Chorus, Shanghai 1936 As relations with Japan grew more tense, in February 1937, at the invitation of General Fu Zuoyi and acting under the auspices of the national YMCA, Liu formed a war zone Soldier Relief Board in Suiyuan, in western China. Liu later recalled that General Fu told him that ‚ÄúMass singing and slogans are the two great weapons to train the people and soldiers. Of the two, singing is more important because during the war it can stimulate a spirit of unity among our soldiers and masses.‚Äù Israel Epstein, then a young reporter for a Tianjin newspaper, reported many years later that he first heard Liu in the gymnasium of the Tianjin YMCA in the summer of 1937. The hall was filled with ‚Äúordinary people from the street ‚Äì students, petty clerks, workmen, schoolchildren, newsboys, and even rickshaw pullers,‚Äù who ‚Äúwith serious faces repeated the separate phrase of the song they were being taught. Then they sang two phrases at a time. Then a whole stanza....‚Äù Epstein further recalled that Liu :seemed to be listening to and prompting each singer separately, while at the same time he never stopped singing. He seemed two men ‚Äì one singing, like his audience with relieved passion at being able at last to utter the ‚Äòone last cry‚Äô of every Chinese; the other disciplined and methodical, teaching and listening. Two Japanese detectives appeared, and some of the audience seemed intimidated, but Liu merely said that the doors of the hall were open to all who had come to sing, and asked the detectives to join in singing \\"March of the Volunteers.\\" Afterwards Liu explained to Epstein that if he had allowed the Japanese to intimidate him, the young men he hoped to train would have drifted away, but that if he had incited the crowd to throw the Japanese out, the movement would have been shut down. \\"You do not realize,\\" he told Epstein, how important an instrument an easily learned song is.\\" Many Chinese cannot read, but \\"the song carries resistance from mouth to mouth.\\" Israel Epstein, History Must Not Be Forgotten (Beijing, 2005), 33-34 After the outbreak of the war with Japan in August 1937, Liu continued to work with the YMCA Soldier Relief Board to provide shelter and relief for wounded soldiers. For a while the United Front provided a truce between the Communist and Nationalist Parties, but by the summer of 1939, the United Front was breaking down. While the Communists were enthusiastic about music as a way to mobilize popular support, the Nationalists were suspicious that popular cultural activities were being manipulated to Communist advantage. The Soldier Relief Board and Liu's team of relief workers were in Changsha, Hunan, when the local Nationalist military burned the town to prevent it from falling into the hands of an anticipated Japanese advance which never materialized. Liu‚Äôs group managed to save the YMCA building and to evacuate many of the wounded soldiers, but determined it would be safer to move on to Zhejiang. In Zhejiang, Liu tried to keep good relations with local Nationalist government and army, but when Zhou Enlai visited him, the military police became suspicious and raided Liu's relief camp. The communist New Fourth Army invited him to join their cultural work, but Liu feared the political control that the move would have required. Liu saw his Christian faith as more important than loyalty to either the GMD or the CCP. Liu set out for Shanghai to seek the support of Soong Ching-ling, the widow of Sun Yat-sen, who had become the protector of leftist cultural activities, but before he could reach her the Nationalist police put him under house arrest. Only the intervention of the American YMCA freed him. He soon left with his family for the United States and did not return to China for nearly ten years. In the United States, 1940-1949 Mass singing continued to be Liu's weapon to raise support for China. He briefly attended Crozer Theological Seminary a Baptist institution outside Philadelphia.OldChesterPa.com: Crozer Theological Seminary October 1940 (Accessed February 11, 2015). When he arrived in New York in 1940 he immediately organized a chorus for the Chinese Youth Club that sang for war rallies. Liu also rallied support for China's war effort through the international network of progressive figures. Soon after he arrived in New York, Liu mentioned to a friend that he knew of the African American singer and political activist Paul Robeson and his early support for China, and said that he would like to meet him. The friend (perhaps Lin Yutang) phoned Robeson, who came within half an hour. At a concert at New York's Lewisohn Stadium a few weeks later, Robeson sang Cheelai in what Liu described as \\"perfect Mandarin.\\" Reportedly in communication with the original lyricist Tian Han, the pair translated the anthem into English.Liang Luo. \\"International Avant-garde and the Chinese National Anthem: Tian Han, Joris Ivens, and Paul Robeson\\" in The Ivens Magazine, No. 16\\\\. European Foundation Joris Ivens, October 2010. Accessed 28 January 2015. In early 1941 Liu and the Children's Chorus recorded an album of Chinese songs with Robeson for Keynote Records. Liu toured the country to raise money for United China Relief. and appeared onstage with such figures as Pearl S. Buck and Eleanor Roosevelt in a series of rallies which attracted thousands in New York and Philadelphia . He also appeared in places with a less high profile, such as Bedford, Trimble County, in the hills of Kentucky, where some 400 farmers contributed eggs, sorghum, chickens, turkeys, potatoes, apples, corn and home canned foods to be auctioned. Liu told reporters \\"These are the American people, and they are doing their best to help their own boys and the suffering people of the United Nations through the National War Fund.\\" \\"Kentucky Hill Folk Raise Fund Through Produce Auction\\" News of United China Relief Vol 3 # 12 December 9, 1944 p. 3 (Accessed February 11, 2015) As he became more familiar with American society, Liu grew openly critical of its racism towards African-Americans and Asians. Liu linked the interests of the two non-white groups. He declared to students at Lincoln University in Philadelphia that \\"If we lick fascism and Japanese imperialism we lick jim crow and anti-Semitism at the same time.\\" The editor of the Pittsburgh Courier, a newspaper with a primarily black readership, then asked Liu to become a regular contributor to the editorial page. Liu urged readers to start a write-in campaign to tell Congress to repeal the Chinese Exclusion Act and pass the Anti-poll Tax Bill and the Anti Lynching Bill. Yet Liu was disappointed that some blacks were suspicious of Chinese. He explained to the Chinese Hand Laundry Alliance, another key progressive ally, that blacks were \\"treated poorly and often heard insulting words in Chinese restaurants.\\" and their disappointment turned to anger. \\"We should understand that blacks and we Chinese are like each other,\\" he continued, \\"we are the nations being discriminated against and oppressed.....\\" Renqiu Yu, To Save China, To Save Ourselves: The Chinese Hand Laundry Alliance of New York (Philadeplphia: Temple University Press, 2011) pp. 122-123 When accusations of racism were made against a Chinese restaurant owner on the West Coast Liu urged his readers to report any such incidents to the Chinese consul. He pointed to the African American and Chinese soldiers who worked side by side building the Burma Road in China, declaring that these men \\"know that all are comrades and brothers.\\" During Madme Chiang Kai-shek's visit to the United States in 1943, Liu was openly critical of the Nationalist government of her husband, even more so when she made remarks that seemed to disparage African Americans. By 1945 these incidents had made the Pittsburgh Courier's African American readers so distrustful of Chinese that the publisher discontinued Liu's connection with the paper. In 1945 Liu addressed the Chinese Students' Christian Association, the oldest such group in North America, to attack the dictatorial rule of the Nationalists. In 1949, when he was about to be deported, Liu returned to China. The New China In September 1949 Liu attended the People's Consultative Conference in Beijing, along with other left-liberal figures. Liu was among those suggesting that March of the Volunteers be made the new National Anthem.\\"ÂàòËâØÊ®°,\\" ÁôæÂ∫¶ÁôæÁßë (Baidu Baike) In July 1950, Liu, along with YMCA secretary Y.T. Wu and other Christian leaders, signed an open letter calling on Christians to support the New China, and joined with other Protestants in organizing the Three Self Patriotic Movement, which called for the Chinese church to be independent of foreign control and finance. Liu published articles in the Three Self Patriotic Movement's journal, Tian Feng, such as one criticizing imperialism (May 19, 1951). The Shanghai YMCA Press published books by Liu explaining Mao Zedong's New Democracy and How America Uses Religion to Invade China. In July 1951, the Three -Self Patriotic Movement sent Liu and a work team to the Shanghai headquarters of the Seventh-day Adventists, where they held three public accusation meetings. Liu prepared his work group by explaining that a successful meeting would use charges of \\"imperialism, bandits, and wicked tyrants\\" to \\"arouse the righteous indignation and accusations of Christians towards imperialism and bad elements in the churches.‚Äù Liu explained the stages in which emotions would be handled: ‚Äúfirst high tension, then moderate, then another of high tension... only so can the accusation meeting be a success.‚Äù Before each meeting, Liu rehearsed the participants, reviewed the accusation speeches, and ordered the accusers to memorize them and to shed tears when talking about their sufferings. Participants were to shout anti- imperialist slogans and sing revolutionary songs. In 1954 Liu attended the First National Chinese Christian Conference, held in Beijing,Cao Shengjie, ‚ÄúMy Recollection of the First National Chinese Christian Conference, 1954,‚Äù Chinese Theological Review 23 (2011), p. 164 Following the end of the Cultural Revolution, during which Christians and their churches were attacked, Liu held positions in the Chinese YMCA and the Shanghai government. In 1978 a forum to solicit views on amending the Constitution was held in Shanghai. Y.T. Wu, Liu‚Äôs longtime colleague, was then in the hospital, but asked Liu to read the meeting his statement requesting that the article on freedom of religious belief be returned to the wording of the 1954 Constitution. The article was not changed at that time.Cao Shengjie, ‚ÄúRecalling the Later Years of Mr. Y.T. Wu,\\" Chinese Theological Review 23 (2011), p. 142 In 1982, Liu, then vice- chairman of the Shanghai Political Consultative Conference, submitted a photo to Liberation Daily which he had taken in 1938 when he visited Nanjing to record the atrocities wrought by the Japanese army. The photo was of a hospitalized little girl who had lost her arm. The girl, by then a school teacher, saw it and came to see Liu in Shanghai.Katsuichi Honda, The Nanjing Massacre: A Japanese Journalist Confronts Japan's National Shame (Armonk: M.E.

Early years Macneil was born in the town of Wick, Ontario, Canada, in 1850. He received a high school education and made plans for college, but the death of his father ended those plans. After a few years of experience in the business life of his Canada, Macneil removed to Chicago, where, in the capacity of cashier and auditor, he connected himself with the firm of Ingraham, Corbln & May, wholesale grocers.

The town of San Fernando, California stands on this land. He acquired a large acreage where the towns of Ontario and Upland are located, soon after the Chaffeys had organized the Ontario colony, and assisted in promoting and establishing both of these cities. Macneil was also associated with J. S. Slauson, James Slauson and others in organizing the Azusa Land and Water Company, which, in April, 1887, established the town of Azusa. Macneil, in 1891, took up his residence there and for the next few years devoted himself to planting orange and lemon lands, the development and transportation of water from the San Gabriel Canon, and the early organization of the Southern California Fruit Exchange.

His compositional output mainly consisted of works for military bands. His best known work, Grand Overture of Quebec, was written in honour of Lady Mary Lennox, the daughter of the Duke of Richmond. It was first performed by the British Army's 60th Foot Regiment band on the occasion of the Duke of Richmond's visit to the Government House in Quebec City in February 1819. Life and career Born in Germany, Brauneis was baptized soon after his birth on 29 March 1785 at Herrnsheim, near Worms. Trained as a musician in his native country, he joined the British Army's 70th Foot Regiment band with whom he traveled to Quebec City in 1813. After serving in the band in Upper Canada for five years, he resigned from his position in 1818 to become a music teacher in Quebec City where he gave instruction on the piano among other instruments. Brauneis was appointed director of the R√©giment d'artillerie band, a popular artillery battalion band in Quebec in 1831. One of the musicians in the band, Charles Sauvageau, was also his pupil. He died the following year; a victim of the 1832 cholera epidemic. His son, Jean-Chrysostome Brauneis II, was an important musician and teacher in Quebec City. His granddaughter, Marie-Josephine Sydney, was married to politician Henry Stanislas Harwood, and his great- grandson was the well known Canadian gynecologist Louis de Lotbiniere- Harwood.The Canadian parliamentary companion, 1891, JA Gemmill References Category:1785 births Category:1832 deaths Category:19th-century composers Category:19th-century classical musicians Category:Canadian composers Category:Canadian male composers Category:Canadian music educators Category:Canadian conductors (music) Category:Male conductors (music) Category:19th-century conductors (music) Category:Musicians from Quebec City Category:German emigrants to pre-Confederation Canada Category:Deaths from cholera Category:19th-century male musicians ","title":"Jean-Chrysostome Brauneis I"},{"id":"45198314","text":"Fig. 1: Radical disproportionation via a radical elimination mechanism Fig. 2: Depolymerization of polystyrene via a radical elimination mechanism Fig. 3: An acyl-CoA dehydrogenase-catalyzed reaction in a radical elimination reaction An elimination reaction of free radicals is the mechanism by which free radicals can undergo an elimination reaction to form olefins.Ansylen, E.

Reaction mechanisms Radicals can undergo a disproportionation reaction through a radical elimination mechanism (See Fig. 1). Here a radical abstracts a hydrogen atom from another same radical to form two non-radical species: an alkane and an alkene. Radicals can also undergo an elimination reaction to generate a new radical as the leaving group. For example, when polystyrene decomposes upon heating at a temperature above 300¬∞C, a styrene monomer is generated via a radical elimination mechanism (See Fig. 2).Grassie, N.; Kerr, W. W. Trans. Faraday Soc., 1957, 53, 234-239 Here, the new radical is generated on the polymer chain, which can further undergo a similar type of reaction to generate more styrene molecules. This process is known as the radical mediated depolymerization of polystyrene. Radical elimination reactions are found in enzyme-catalyzed pathways. In the dehydrogenation reaction of acyl-CoA to form enoyl-CoA, FAD accepts two protons and two electrons to form FADH2 under the catalysis of acyl-CoA dehydrogenase.Thorpe, C.; Kim, J.

The process enables the transfer of an impression from a steel plate to a steel cylinder in a rolling press. An individual who engraves steel plates was known as a siderographist in the mid 1800s, and a siderographer by the early 1900s. Perkins developed the use of steel plates in banknote production in 1805, and these were more resistant to wear from printing than copper plates. Siderography enabled the steel plates to be copied with greater frequency. It was first used for printing banknotes of the United States dollar. Counterfeiting had become an important issue in Europe in the late 1700s and early 1800s, primarily because the banknotes were produced with no standardized process or design, using readily available technology and techniques familiar to over 10,000 copper engravers. France offered a prize contest in the 1790s as a result of the counterfeiting of assignats. One of the submitted proposals for this contest had been the use of siderography, though it was not viable at the time. The English banknotes of that era came to be known as \\"filthy rags\\", and in 1817, the Bank of England advertised a contest for the submission of a process to develop counterfeit-resistant banknotes, for which the winning entry would receive . Perkins moved to England in 1818, and made preparations for equipment, machinery, and his workmen to follow him. He submitted his proposal for the use of siderography in banknote production, but the idea was not well received by the Bank of England. Despite this, the idea gained traction, and by the end of the 1920s siderography was in use by over 200 banks in the United Kingdom. By the 1930s, a transfer press was operated by a siderographer, who would manipulate a \\"system of compound levers\\" on the press to regulate the amount of pressure exerted on the transfer rolls. Trade union On 11 January 1899, the Steel Plate Transferrers' Association trade union was established in Washington, D.C., which by 1921 had changed its name to the International Association of Siderographers. It was the smallest organization by membership in the AFL‚ÄìCIO (American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations), reaching a peak of about 80 members in the 1930s, and was dissolved in 1991 after retirements and technological advances reduced its membership to eight people. It had three local chapters: the Washington office had jurisdiction for membership in that city, and all members outside the United States excluding Canada and Great Britain; the New York office had jurisdiction for all members in the United States excluding Washington, D.C.; and the Ottawa office had jurisdiction for all members in Canada and Great Britain.

He has produced both empirical and theoretical works. Fligstein's main theoretical works center in economic sociology where he has created a \\"political-cultural\\" approach to markets in works on corporate control, the \\"architecture of markets\\",Scott, W. William Richard. Institutions and organizations: Ideas, interests, and identities. Sage Publications, 2013. and \\"markets as politics.\\"Aldrich, Howard. Organizations evolving. Sage, 1999. He has used these ideas to study the European Union's attempt to create a single market through cooperative political means. In 2012, he published a book with Doug McAdam entitled A Theory of Fields that proposes a cohesive view of field theory as an approach to study many of the key features of modern life including politics, the economy, and social movements.  Biography  Born in Seattle, Washington, Fligstein obtained his BA in 1973 from Reed College, his MS in 1976 from the University of Wisconsin, and his Ph.D. in 1979 from the University of Wisconsin.John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation (2005) Reports of the President and of the Treasurer. p. 73. After his graduation Fligstein started his academic career in 1979 as an Assistant Professor of Sociology at the University of Arizona. From 1980 to 1982, he was at the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago, where he was appointed Senior Study Director and NIMH Postdoctoral Fellow. Fligstein returned to the University of Arizona and in 1984 he was promoted to associate professor and in 1990 full professor. From 1984 to 1988 he was the director of the SBSRI Data and Software Library. In 1991 he moved to the University of California, Berkeley, where he was appointed Professor of Sociology. He was the department chair from 1992 to 1995. Fligstein is the founder and director of the Center for Culture, Organization, and Politics at the Institute for Research on Labor and Employment at the University of California, Berkeley; the center has been in existence since 1998. Fligstein has been the recipient of various honors and awards. He was named the Class of 1939 Chancellor's Professor at the University of California, Berkeley in 1997. He was a fellow at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences in Palo Atlo, California, in 1994‚Äì95, a Guggenheim Fellow in 2004‚Äì05, and a fellow at the Rockefeller Center in Bellagio, Italy, in 2007. Fligstein was elected a member of the American Academy of arts and Sciences in 2010. He has also been a visiting scholar at many institutions including the Max Planck Institute in Cologne, the Ecole Normal Superiore-Cachan, Sciences-Po in Paris, Center for the Study of Organizations in Paris, the European University Institute in Florence, and the Copenhagen Business School.  Work  Fligstein's work has mainly focused on a novel theoretical approach to develop a sociological view on how new social institutions emerge, remain stable, and are transformed. He has used this perspective to study a wide variety of seemingly disparate phenomena. Fligstein's innovation is to consider how most of social action takes place in what he calls \\"meso-level social orders\\" or fields. He is interested in theorizing how individuals and groups come to face off against one another in social arenas where there is something at stake. His book with Doug McAdam, A Theory of Fields, makes a very general set of claims about how such orders operate. They argue that at the beginning of such projects, a social movement like process exists because of the fluid conditions in a particular social space. What is at stake, who the players are, and what will end up being the underlying logic of the order are all up for grabs. He is also well known for proposing how to produce a sociological view of action that makes actors key to the creation of these orders. He argues that social skill, the ability to empathize with others and thereby engage in collective action, is at the basis of gaining cooperation to produce new fields and keep existing ones going. He posits that actors with social skill are especially important as fields emerge as they are the one who provide collective identities that bring people together to cooperate to produce a social order. = Theory of markets = Fligstein has used his perspective in the context of developing a theory of markets. This theory views the production of a new market as the creation of a meso-level social order or field. Here, competition between firms often results in the creation of markets characterized by incumbents and challengers where the incumbents' business model dominates how the market operates. He calls such a perspective a \\"conception of control\\". Fligstein provocatively argues that the creation of a market implies a collective stable order that works to mitigate the worse effects of competition. He also views the state as central to the construction of stable markets providing not just a general social order and a legal system, but often as a participant and regulator of many markets. In Architecture of Markets, he develops this approach in a quite general way and then applies it to understand the emergence of shareholder value capitalism in the U.S., the construction of labor markets across countries, the varieties of capitalism, and globalization. His \\"markets as politics\\" approach is considered to be one of the foundational works in modern economic sociology. = History of the large American corporation = Fligstein's study of the history of the large American corporation shows how this process evolved in the U.S. from 1870 to 1980. He shows how the conception of the corporation changed as owners and managers of firms faced challenges from competition. In the late 1800s and early 1900s, owners and managers worked to establish monopolies. When government challenged this in the 1910s through the use of antitrust law, firms had to have new business models that did not involve taking over entire markets. This led to the creation of oligopolies in many U.S. markets where 2‚Äì4 large firms would dominate particular markets and use their size to set prices and mitigate competition. This peaked during the 1920s as a way to avoid antitrust attention. The depression of the 1930s produced a general economic crisis. Fligstein shows that firms responded by diversifying their product lines and aggressively using sales and marketing tactics to increase market share and guarantee at least some market for their products. Finally, the government once again pursued antitrust policy aggressively in the post World war II era. They tried to prevent increasing product concentration within product lines. This encourage businesses to diversify even more. It gave rise to the conglomerate form and eventually to the creation of most of the modern financial tactics to engage in mergers and acquisitions in the 1950‚Äì1980s. = Construction of a European legal and political system = Fligstein has also used this framework to understand the construction of a European legal and political system. He has shown how the European Single Market project was mostly aimed at making it easier for businesses who were already involved in international trade to expand their activities across Europe. He has also shown how the political and legal integration in Brussels promoted trade by making it easier to trade. His book Euroclash: The EU, European identity, and the Future of Europe shows how economic, social, and political fields have formed around Europe in the wake of the creation of the European Union. The book presents a set of analyses that show how the increased economic cooperation across Europe has transformed industries and countries. it has also create opportunities for European citizens to travel, learn second languages, and live in other countries. The book explores how this has affected European identities. it demonstrates that around 13% of people in Europe think of themselves mostly as Europeans. these people tend to be well educated, have professional and managerial jobs, and be politically liberal. About half of Europeans sometimes think of themselves as Europeans. Fligstein goes on to explore how this has played out across various political issues. He demonstrates that if a majority of citizens in the member states support more integration, it will occur. But he argues that most politics remains national and citizens who mainly have a national identity continue to support their nation states as their most democratic representatives.

Early years and family Buffum was born at Salem, Massachusetts, May 10, 1832, the son of James Rice and Susan (Mansfield) Buffum. Buffum received his early education in the public schools at Salem. There he remained until he was fifteen years of age. Buffum's father was engaged in the publishing business in Salem. His personal friend and colleague was Nathaniel Hawthorne. Career In 1850, Buffum's brother George was appointed postmaster of Stockton, California, by President Zachary Taylor. Stockton at that time was one of the centers of the gold mining country. Soon after his appointment, George sent for his brother to assist him in the post office and in May, 1850, Buffum took passage at New York City for San Francisco, traveling by way of the Isthmus of Panama. Reaching California, he immediately proceeded to Stockton, where he assisted his brother in the introduction of the postal system. With thousands flocking to the gold fields, and the mail transportation methods relying entirely upon the Pony Express and the long route from the East by water, the difficulties that beset the Buffum brothers were so manifold as to divert from the mind of the two all thought of hunting for the gold that everyone had gone to California to seek. In a short time, however, the gold fever finally entered the veins of young Buffum and he joined a party in a prospecting trip to Calaveras. There, he engaged for a time in mining, but failed to find gold. In 1859, Buffum removed to Los Angeles, where he became agent for the most important distilling concern in the West. In 1871, when the Territory of Arizona was first opened, Buffum was one of the first to enter business in that territory as a merchant. Although he remained in Los Angeles for several years thereafter, he formed a partnership with John G. Campbell, under the firm name of Campbell and Buffum. This firm grew to be the most important merchandising concern in the territory, and both its members played important parts in the formative history of the territory. At the time Buffum went to Arizona, General George Crook was governor of the military post at Prescott, and here the firm opened its store. In 1873, Buffum went to Prescott to join his partner in the business, which had by that time assumed large proportions. In Prescott, Buffum became one of the important men of the region, acquiring a reputation for stability and honor. As a public-spirited citizen, he took a leading part in the affairs of the city and territory. He associated with Eli P. Clark and Gen. Moses Sherman, the builders of the Pasadena and Los Angeles transit systems. Buffum was a member of the early days Arizona Territorial Legislature. His colleague there was Thomas Fitch. Later, Buffum became a member of the Board of School Trustees of Prescott and was its head when Sherman was invited there to inaugurate the school system. In 1877, he was appointed by General Fremont as a member of the State's Prison Commission, and as such rendered valuable aid in checking the graft that had found its way into the politics of the State. Buffum remained engaged in business in Prescott until the early 1880s. During his career there, he was one of the first men interested in the Arizona Verde mines, which later became one of the most notable copper properties in the world. With Governor Frederick Augustus Tritle of Arizona, he owned this mine for several years. In 1889, Buffum gave up his business in Arizona and returned to Los Angeles, where he became associated with Sherman and Clark, who were then engaged in financing and promoting the street railway systems in Pasadena and Los Angeles. He was made cashier of the Los Angeles Pacific Railroad company, sharing the difficult tasks that met these projects in their organic state. As cashier and collector for the promoters, he handled large sums of money. For twenty years, he remained with Clark and Sherman, at the same time engaging in the realty business and in general investments on his personal account. At various times, he was the owner of some of the largest and most important realty parcels in the business district of Los Angeles. When the old Temple estate was subdivided he was one of the largest purchasers, investing heavily in property that later become priceless and that has netted immense profits to a line of subsequent purchasers. He was one of the most optimistic believers in the future of Los Angeles. The block where now stands Coulter's Dry Goods Store (at 5600 Wilshire Blvd.) was once owned by him. He at different times also owned the corner of Franklin and New High streets, the corner of Broadway and Spring, and the block on Twelfth Street between Hill and Olive streets, Los Angeles. At Jefferson and Main streets, he owned 40 acres of land. Personal life Rebecca Evans Buffum and Asa Mansfield Buffum He married Rebecca Evans of Smithfield, Fayette County, Pennsylvania, in 1864, at Los Angeles, California. They had two sons, Asa Mansfield Buffum, and one son who died in infancy. Rebecca was a descendant of the Brownfields of Pennsylvania, to whom King George III granted a vast estate in that State, afterwards known as George's Township. Buffum throughout his life had been a prominent member of the Royal Arch Chapter of Masonry and of the California Society. He died June 12, 1905, and was buried by the Masonic Order. He was survived by his widow, Rebecca Evans Buffum.

Opened in 1969, it currently features Kohl's, along with Bed Bath & Beyond and four other smaller stores in the former south mall wing, with three additional stores within the Meijer space.  History  =Early history= Originally a development of Melvin Simon & Associates (now Simon Property Group), the groundwork for Sheboygan County's first and only enclosed mall was laid in August 1968 with the construction of its first store, large 160,000 sq ft, two-floor J.C. Penney with an auto center as an out-parcel; when J.C. Penney left the auto center business, it became a Firestone Complete Auto Care Center (a Goodyear Auto Center has also been part of the mall since opening, though it moved to the west end of the building in the mid-2000s). Another anchor was a G. C. Murphy variety store, along with a Red Owl supermarket. Both Sears and J.C. Penney moved from their existing stores downtown, though the major locally based department store H.C. Prange declined to leave their downtown location, or even build a branch store at Memorial Mall. Until its January 2014 closure as Boston Store, Prange's and its forerunners remained located downtown at the same location. Although Memorial Mall would hold its official grand opening in April 1970 with over 35 shops, eateries and services, the third and final anchor abutting the north end, an 80,000 sq ft Sears with attached Auto Center would not open until November 1970, completing the 350,000 sq ft complex. Until the opening of Fond Du Lac's Forest Mall in 1973, it was the largest enclosed shopping center in east-central Wisconsin. Upon the closing of Murphy's, Kohl's took over the space in 1983; the building was renovated in the mid-2000s to meet Kohl's current store concepts. Although the mall held their official address on Kohler Memorial Drive (WI 23), by the end of the 70's it had lost its direct connection to that road as it was converted to a freeway in order to interchange with Interstate 43 to the west. This would influence the mall's decline later on, as the convenient access off the busy Kohler Memorial Drive was removed, forcing traffic onto surrounding surface roads. This included Taylor Drive, which upon its 1985 extension south, along with the relocation of WI 28 from Indiana Avenue (which being next to the Sheboygan River, had little development opportunity around wetlands) to Washington Avenue (with plenty of vacant land), became the new major retail corridor in the city and allowed retail competition to the south where previously only marshland, forest and farm fields had existed. =Reconfiguration and later struggles= In 2001, J.C. Penney left the mall, with Hobby Lobby taking over the first floor space and removing the building's existing escalator. In 2003, Simon Property Group sold Memorial Mall and the new owners renovated the mall building. Walgreens departed their longtime location in the mall in 2001 upon the opening of their new central-city store at the intersection of WI 23/28/42. The former Goodyear space after their move to the Red Owl space (which was used by Hobbytown USA for several years) was given over to Bed, Bath & Beyond for a store which outside of sharing a mall entrance, has no indoor entrance within the mall itself. Outside of a several- month period where the off-price discount retailer Famous Brands filled the space, the Walgreens space was never filled again outside of use by organizations for charity events. Many of the mall's existing smaller tenants departed the mall when Kohler's Deer Trace power center opened in 2005. The mall's center court was eventually converted to a children's play area in order to give some use to what was formerly a large public space with food options. In 2012, Memorial Mall was sold at a foreclosure auction. Bank of America, the lender to the mall, bought the property at a sheriff's auction for about $2.1 million. Prior to the auction, the mall was owned by a group of 17 New York-based limited liability companies and had been in foreclosure since 2009, after falling rental rates and a lack of new tenants left owners owing far more on the property than what it's worth. In February 2014, RadioShack closed its store after nearly thirty years of being located inside the mall. Sears Holdings announced the closure of its Memorial Mall store and confirmed the closure of Sears Auto earlier that year; Sears would franchise a Sears Appliance and Hardware Store to take its place which existed until the summer of 2019, located on the city's south side in the Washington Square shopping center (the mall store had removed already removed clothing and white goods by 2012 to focus on appliances, electronics and hardware). 30 employees lost their positions, with the store closed in early February 2015. In January 2015, the mall‚Äôs general manager confirmed that three stores announced their intention to leave the mall; Amy‚Äôs Hallmark, Revolution (an extreme sports shop which consolidated into their location in downtown Sheboygan), and Deb Shops (which was already being liquidated nationwide). =Meijer moves in; future redevelopment= On March 17, 2015, Siegel Gallagher, Inc. represented NRFC Memorial Holdings, LLC on the sale of Memorial Mall to Michigan-based hypermarket retailer Meijer for $10.75 million. The sale included the acquisition of the adjoining Sears store. Meijer has been busy with expansions of its store locations in Wisconsin, with a number of stores opening in southeast Wisconsin since 2015. The company planned to run out the clock on the mall's existing lessees into 2017, opening their new store and adjoining convenience store in 2019 after razing and reconstruction, with Kohl's and Bed, Bath and Beyond retaining their existing buildings and the indoor entrances into the mall either sealed up or converted to exterior entrances. Powers Goodyear will remain in its present form. The four existing stores remaining in the Kohl's forecourt will be retained in the new Meijer development, while Firestone has already relocated into a new building on the city's south side near the Washington Square shopping center. By its last days, the mall's occupancy rate stood at 13% (6 of 48 store spaces), with the north \\"Sears\\" end fully vacant in a space laid out for seventeen store spaces. With the closing of the Mexican restaurant Diamond Dave's Taco Company in May 2016, the mall no longer had any food options. Hobby Lobby wound down operations after Christmas 2016 and vacated on January 14, 2017 with no new location announced, while the Book World bookstore formerly located next to Sears followed shortly thereafter with a move to the nearby Taylor Heights (its parent company went bankrupt only eleven months later). Bath and Body Works closed in April 2017, along with the arcade game room. GNC closed just before the end of July 2017. At the close of business on July 30, 2017, Memorial Mall effectively ceased to exist as a traditional mall, as the next day preliminary demolition preparation and asbestos abatement began (the center court and north ends were mainly demolished on October 11, with the former Penney's building knocked down shortly thereafter and most demolition having finished by mid-December). The Kohl's forecourt remained open during construction, along with all of the existing stores as Meijer's development is built out over the former site of the mall's north end and anchor spaces, with a wall and new entrance constructed at the end of the maintained part of the building. An independent alterations shop, and Shabree Jewelers which maintained their occupancy also remained a part of the mall and as part of the new development; Claire's closed down after the holiday season upon their lease expiration. Two additional spaces built from the former mall corridor face out towards Meijer for tenancies. Construction of the new Meijer store and its new entrances and parking lot continued into 2018, with the store having its grand opening on April 25, 2019. Besides Meijer itself, a Starbucks is located within the Meijer, along with a branch of Kohler Credit Union, a Froedtert urgent care center, and a Meijer Express service station on opening day. Further development on the outlots, included a Panera Bread location that opened on October 25, 2019. Shabree closed at the end of their final lease in 2019, leaving the alterations shop as the last remaining small tenant from before the mall's closure.

After the conclusion of his third year of teaching, he returned to his native Taiwan for a vacation. He was instructed not to leave Taiwan on his scheduled departure date. Members of Taiwan's secret police, the Garrison Command, detained and interrogated him for twelve hours on , and his body was found on the campus of National Taiwan University the next day. The subsequent autopsy reported his death was due to a fall. Chen's death and the earlier massacre of Lin Yi-hsiung's family are cited as late examples of White Terror dissident suppression activities in Taiwan, although the case remains unsolved and the Garrison Command maintains it had nothing to do with his death. In 2020, the Transitional Justice Commission released a report concluding that Chen was most likely killed by state security agencies. Personal life Chen was one of eight children and was outspoken and straightforward, according to his brother. He was known to have criticized the Kuomintang (KMT)-led government in private conversations and advocated for Taiwan independence, raising funds to help those imprisoned in the wake of the Kaohsiung Incident as well as in support for Formosa Magazine, which opposed the KMT's one-party rule. =Academic career= Chen graduated with a B.S. in mathematics from National Taiwan University (NTU) in 1972 and served in the military, fulfilling his compulsory service. He left Taiwan for the United States in 1975, earning M.S. (1976) and Ph.D. (1978) degrees in statistics from the University of Michigan, with Professor Bruce Hill stating that he was \\"outstanding ... the best [student] that I'd seen in statistics in 21 years.\\" Upon graduating from Michigan, he joined the faculty in the Department of Statistics of Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) in the fall of 1978. He published several papers in the area of statistics and probability. Detainment and death After his mother visited him in 1981 and assuaged his concerns about safely traveling to Taiwan, Chen returned to Taiwan for the first time since he had left in 1975, arriving on with his wife and son. He applied for the exit permit required to return to the US upon arrival, but it had not been granted by the time he was scheduled to depart on . Typically, exit permits are granted within 48 hours. Instead, Chen was questioned by Garrison Command for two hours about his United States activities on , with one question about a personal visit revealing that he had been spied upon. After the first interview, Chen was told he should receive the exit permit the next day. Chen's wife, Chen Su-jen (), received a phone call late in the afternoon of asking that Chen remain at home early the next morning to await another phone call from the Entrance and Exit Bureau. On the morning of , officials from Garrison Command showed up at their door and Chen was taken for interrogation, which lasted more than 12 hours. Garrison Command state he was released to return to his brother's apartment, but his body was discovered on the campus of NTU the next morning. A family friend, Teng Wei-hsiang, has claimed that Chen visited him on the evening of after the second interview, where Chen reportedly said he was afraid of being imprisoned, but Teng was unable to remember critical details later. Reportedly, there was some money tucked into his shoe, which is said to be a trick to keep murdered souls moving to the underworld. =Investigations= In the initial days following the discovery of Chen's body, Taiwan Garrison Commander-in-chief General Wang Ching-hsu speculated that Chen committed suicide, fearing arrest for his unpatriotic crimes, and claimed the interview was \\"cordial and friendly.\\" Garrison Command spokesman General Hsu Mei-ling echoed the accusations of suicide, adding that they did not believe his activities did not reach a criminal level. Chen's family stated that it would have been impossible for Chen to commit suicide, as it was uncharacteristic of his nature. Chen Su-jen was immediately suspicious of several wounds which seemed atypical of a fall. Carnegie Mellon's president, Richard Cyert further stated that he had plenty of reasons to live, with a one-year-old son and a promising academic career. In late July, the Taipei district prosecutor's office allowed the possibility the death may have been an accident instead of suicide, opening the possibility of further investigation if new information or evidence became available. The Control Yuan later backed further away from suicide allegations, stating \\"the death was most likely accidental\\" in August 1981. Garrison Command officials contend Chen confessed to seditious acts during his return to Taiwan, soliciting funds to support the anti-government Formosa Magazine and attempting to establish democratic reforms. They confronted him with photocopies of letters he had written to Shih Ming-teh while Shih was imprisoned. Wiretap records released in 2020 revealed that the Garrison Command became aware of Chen through a tapped conversation with Shih, and labeled him as a \\"traitor\\" on the basis of that conversation. CMU President Cyert wrote a letter to Chiang Ching-kuo, who then promised a complete investigation into Chen's death. Cyert later pressed for State Department and congressional investigations once it became clear the KMT-led government had no intention of uncovering the true culprits. Chen Su-jen would later testify at a congressional hearing in October 1981. =Autopsies= Preliminary autopsy results by Taiwan authority stated Chen had suffered thirteen broken ribs, a broken pubis and three fractured vertebrae. Cyril Wecht, a forensic pathologist and a former coroner, stated the autopsy report was incomplete and offered to perform another autopsy. Wecht traveled to Taipei with Morris H. DeGroot, chair of the CMU statistics department in September 1981 to launch their own investigation. Wecht concluded, following a visual examination, and later published in The American Journal of Forensic Medicine and Pathology that Chen was murdered, \\"both the location of the body and the pattern of injuries are consonant with the explanation that Chen's body was held in as horizontal position over the railing of the fire escape and dropped onto the ground below.\\" However, no action was taken by the Taiwan government. Tina Chou (), an American reporter with the Associated Press, had her press credentials revoked by Taiwan's Government Information Office after reporting the results of Wecht's investigation. To protest the government's insufficient investigation, Chen's family refused to inter his body, and the funeral was not held until . =\\"Professional students\\"= While he was a student at Michigan, Chen approached the school newspaper, The Michigan Daily, with a list of alleged secret agents of the Kuomintang government working at Michigan. Although the Daily did not run a story at the time, the issue of \\"professional students\\" with KMT sponsorship became more visible following Chen's death; a \\"professional student\\" is understood to be one who reports on pro-independence students and faculty to the Taiwan government in addition to their studies. US Representative Jim Leach (R-IA) accused Taiwanese students of reporting Chen's activities to KMT authorities in July 1981, and Representative Stephen Solarz (D-NY) held a subcommittee hearing in July 1981 where similar accusations were made. Leach asked the U.S. Attorney General to take positive steps to combat spying, including determining whether or not the use of \\"professional students\\" violated the Foreign Agents Registration Act. One year after Chen's death, student spying activity on the CMU campus was judged to have ceased. James Soong, then the head of the Taiwan Government Information Office, flatly denied student spying allegations. Ma Ying-jeou has been accused numerous times of being a \\"professional student\\", later filing suit over allegations made that he was a \\"professional student\\" at a memorial rally for Chen. Legacy =Memorials= CMU and NTU have both held memorial services on the anniversary of Chen's death. Students at NTU successfully lobbied to rename the campus square where Chen's body was found as a memorial space, and a design contest was held to increase student and public awareness of Chen's death. Chen's father tried to set up a scholarship in Chen's name, but was denied permission by the government. =Lawsuit= Chen's family filed suit against five officials of the Taiwan Garrison General Headquarters in 2001, seeking the truth behind the events leading up to his death. They had hoped that when Chen Shui-bian was elected, the investigation would be reopened, but were disappointed. =Formosa Betrayed= The events surrounding Chen's death as well as the murder of Henry Liu inspired the film Formosa Betrayed. =Later investigation= In 2006, the Taipei prosecutor's office stated that missing evidence and personnel were hampering any further investigations. However, the original interrogation transcript was recovered in 2009, giving fresh hope to investigators. Four weeks later, the prosecutor's office closed its investigation, stating there was insufficient evidence to charge five Garrison Command officials: Wang Ching-hsu (), Kuo Hsueh-chou (), Tsuo Hsiao-han (), Wang Wen-bin () and Wang Yi-hua (). The investigations were criticized for not taking a fresh look at the existing evidence, questioning the motivation behind reopening the case. On 5 May 2020, the Transitional Justice Commission released a report that found that Chen was most likely killed by state security agents.

It was established as a response to the murder of a protester by a member of the ruling family during a Pan-Arabism demonstration. The movement's establishment took place during a period of popular dissent with the ruling family's extravagant lifestyles, and increasing support of Pan-Arabism. The group's main demands were centered on decreasing royal privilege; ending employment of foreigners; establishing social welfare facilities; legalizing labor unions and instituting municipal councils composed of at least partly elected members. The group became inactive in May 1963 after the government arrested and detained many of its most prominent members. History =Origins= Protests against the ruling family started taking place in the first half of the 1950s. One of the largest protests took place in 1956; it drew 2,000 participants, most of whom were high-ranking Qataris allied with Arab nationalists and dissatisfied oil workers. In a protest in August 1956, the participants waved Egyptian flags and chanted anti-colonialism slogans. In October, protesters tried to sabotage oil pipelines in the Persian Gulf by destroying the pipelines with a bulldozer. Hamad Al Attiya, who went on to co-found the movement, was blamed by the British for spearheading the sabotage. By 1963, the population of Qatar had grown increasingly discontent with the ruling family's extravagant lifestyle and Sheikh Ahmad bin Ali Al Thani's long absences abroad since he ascended to the throne in 1960. =1963 protests= In February 1963, noisy Pan-Arabism protests broke out in Qatar following the overthrow of Abd al-Karim Qasim of Iraq during the February Ramadan Revolution. Most of the protesters were Iraqi or Yemeni, and some carried pictures of Gamal Abdel Nasser and encouraged bystanders to kiss their photographs. More demonstrations broke out on 18 April. These were organized by Arab nationalists who supported their countries' union with the United Arab Republic. They chanted support for Abdel Nasser and expressed disdain towards Hussein of Jordan, Saud of Saudi Arabia and European colonialism. Some demonstrators held up pictures of Arab leaders and banners supporting oil workers in the Shell Company. The emir confined the demonstrations to the areas encompassing Al Tahrir Stadium, Fereej Al Hitmi, Fereej Al Khulaifat and east Old Airport. Most of the demonstrations on this day took place at football games. The demonstrations ended prematurely after protesters traveling from Al Tahrir Stadium were barred from entering Doha Stadium. On 19 April, a large demonstration took place during a street festival in Al Rayyan. Several activists, including Hamad Al Attiya, gave speeches calling for labor reforms and advocating patriotism. Yemeni migrants held a separate protest in southern Doha near a gas station. During the protest, a relative of the ruler of Qatar named Sheikh Abdulrahman bin Mohammed Al Thani was blocked off from the road where the protest was taking place. He ordered them to disperse and make way for his car. The protesters responded by demanding that he move out of their way. Sheikh Abdulrahman then opened fire on the crowd, killing a protester. A petition was circulated for the arrest of Sheikh Abdulrahman, but no action was taken by the government. A few years later, Sheikh Abdulrahman was acquitted of killing a relative, Sheikh Ahmed bin Abdulaziz Al Thani. =Beginning of the movement= The Qatar National Unity Front was co-founded by Abdullah Al Missned, a wealthy businessman, and a tribal leader and government official named Hamad Al Attiya in response to the 19 April shooting. It soon gained popularity among Arab nationalists, individuals sympathetic to the Ba'ath Party, Qatari workers and low-ranking Al Thani officials. The movement was strongest in the northern city of Al Khor. Ibrahim Shahdad, a professor of modern history, suggests that the actual inception date of the National Unity Front was not in April 1963 but in the late fifties, a period when many secret nationalist cells were established. The group made a statement in which it listed 35 of its demands to the government, most of which entailed less authority for the ruling family; protection for oil workers; voting rights for citizens and the Arabization of the leadership. While the Saudi monarch was at the ruler's palace on 20 April, a demonstration occurred in front of the building. Police fired and killed three demonstrators, prompting the National Unity Front to organize a general strike on 21 April. The strike lasted around two weeks, and most public services were affected. Hamad Al Attiya issued a statement on 28 April which proclaimed that the time has come to reform the country's policies and to set up a high-society with justice and equality. Abdel Nasser sought to capitalize on popular support in Qatar by pressuring the government to send financial aid to Yemen. =Uprising and government crackdown= The National Unity Front staged a mini-uprising in the central Doha market in response to the government crackdowns in which it reiterated its demands. The government rejected most of these demands, and in early May, around fifty of the most prominent National Unity Front members and sympathizers were arrested and detained without trial. Hamad Al Attiya died in jail in 1966. Nasser Al Missned, a prominent authority figure and the son of Abdullah Al Missned, immigrated to Kuwait after he was released from prison in 1965. The residents of several towns, with notable concentrations in Al Khor, fled to Kuwait after the group's dissolution. Some members of the group also fled to Lebanon and to the UAE. Around 5,000 people fled in total and 471 oil workers were put out of work as a result of the aftermath of the crackdown. In May, a coalition of Qatari students in the United Kingdom and the University of Cairo, whose scholarships had been cut as a result of the protests, signed a petition requesting the release of the detainees. The petition received little press coverage. Qatari academic Ali Khalifa Al-Kuwari states that Qatari businessmen pressured the Egyptian government to falsely report on the 1963 uprising to cast the Qatari government in a positive light. The emir instituted some reforms in response to the movements. This included the provision of land and loans to poor farmers in 1964. He also agreed to demands of preferential hiring of Qatari citizens and the election of a municipal council. The government lifted its travel ban over members of the movement in 1972.

He lived for a time in Hampton, New Hampshire. As a teenage trumpet player, he attended the Summer Youth Music School program at the University of New Hampshire, where he lived, worked, and played for two weeks exclusively with other musicians. He has said of that experience: > I don't know where my life would have gone if I hadn't met people who loved > music as much as I did. I also learned there were people more talented than > me, better at their instruments, who worked harder, who practiced more. The > only way I would get better, I realized, was to work at it. I learned > diligence and a practice ethic. He moved west to Denver in the 1970s and lived there until his death. Musical career Barwick has been a weekly regular at Denver's historic Buckhorn Exchange since 1984. For over 30 years, he has been a major part of the Walnut Valley Festival in Winfield, Kansas, one of the country's largest acoustic music events.

Early life Armstrong was born on October 8, 1889 in St. Andrews, New Brunswick to Robert Edwin and Margaret Patterson Armstrong. In 1910 he graduated from the University of New Brunswick with a Bachelor of Science degree in Civil Engineering. From 1911 to 1915, he was a municipal consultant in Western Canada. From 1913 to 1914, he took post- graduate courses in applied science at McGill University. In 1915, he was appointed engineer and superintendent of water and sewer in Saint John, New Brunswick. Military Armstrong enlisted in the Canadian Expeditionary Force on May 4, 1916. He was appointed lieutenant in the 65th Battery of the Canadian Field Artillery. He was later transferred to the 14th Brigade. In France, Armstrong served as an engineer. His duty was to ensure that the Canadian Expeditionary Force received an adequate supply of water. In 1918 he was awarded the Military Cross at a ceremony in Buckingham Palace for distinguished action under enemy fire. Town manager and consulting In 1919, Armstrong became the first Town Manager of Woodstock, New Brunswick. In 1923 he married Muriel Smith of Woodstock. They would have two children. That same year he went to work for the Citizens Research Institute of Canada, where he was employed as a consultant for public and industrial groups, including hospitals. His consulting work involved making administrative surveys and playing an active role in administrative reorganization. In 1924 he was appointed acting Superintendent of Victoria Hospital in London, Ontario. He later returned to municipal management as Town Manager of Windsor, Nova Scotia. Kingston General Hospital In 1924, Kingston General Hospital suffered from a number of personnel and management problems. Based on the recommendation of Dr. Horace Brittain, the hospital's Board of Governors decided to appoint someone with an administrative background rather than a medical one to run the hospital. Brittain also recommended that Armstrong be interviewed for the position. In March 1925, Armstrong was appointed Superintendent of Kingston General Hospital. Armstrong was able to balanced the hospital's budget while maintaining and adding new services. He led the hospital through the Great Depression and World War II. Due to decreasing patient incomes during the Depression, Armstrong developed the Community Cooperative Group Hospital Plan, Ontario's first public health insurance plan. To help offset the reduction of rates caused by the Depression, In 1932, Armstrong and the entire hospital staff donated five percent of the salaries to the hospital. In 1942 he introduced a ten-year plan to expand the hospital. The expansion included the construction of the Victory Wing, which included the first cancer clinic in Ontario, a dietary wing, the Walter T. Connell Wing, and a children‚Äôs hospital. Armstrong retired from KGH in 1957, but stayed on as a consultant until the construction projects were completed. While at KGH, Armstrong was president of the Ontario Hospital Association and the Canadian Hospital Association, as well as was a fellow of the American College of Hospital Administrators. Later life and death After his retirement, Armstrong became a member of the Board of Governors of Kingston General Hospital. In 1976 KHG's outpatient building, the Fraser Armstrong Patient Centre, was named in his honor. He also worked as a representative of the Montreal Trust Company. In September 1983, Armstrong moved into a retirement home in Kingston, Ontario. He died on October 11, 1983 from burns he suffered in a fire at the retirement home. He was 94 years old.

The Strahlkogel is also the highest mountain in the municipality of Umhausen. Its name comes from its great, white, light-reflecting, quartz layers, which allegedly cause the mountain to \\"radiate\\" (strahlen). It has the shape of a well-proportioned, steep and pointed pyramid. Ascending the Strahlkogel is difficult and it is thus only rarely visited, unlike the neighbouring 3,287-metre-high Breiter Grieskogel. The first ascent of the mountain was in 1833 by Peter Carl Thurwieser, but his route and the precise circumstances of the climb have not been passed on. On 28 August 1887 Ludwig Purtscheller and Fritz Drasch from Salzburg climbed the mountain. Their route led along the west ar√™te. Today, this is the normal route and easiest way to reach the summit.  Area  The Strahlkogel lies a good five kilometres as the crow flies northeast of L√§ngenfeld in the √ñtztal valley and 7 km west- southwest of L√ºsens in the Lisenstal valley. It is surrounded by glaciers to the east and west. The steep and heavily crevassed Larstigferner to the east reaches a height of up to 3,200 metres, and in the south lies the flatter, but wider Grasstallferner, that reaches a height of 3,100 metres. Its neighbouring peaks are the 3,287-metre-high Breiter Grie√ükogel on the ice divide between the Grasstallferner and Grie√üferner glaciers, the Grasstaller Grie√ükogel (3,160 m) on the prominent Strahlkogel West Arete, and the Larstigspitze (3,173 m) to the east, separated by the Larstigscharte notch (3,032 m).  Start points and paths  The present normal route to the Strahlkogel runs along the West Arete. The start point for an ascent is the village of Niederthai in the √ñtztal valley at a height of 1,538 metres above sea level. From there the route runs southwards to the lake of Grasstallsee, then east on the Grasstallferner glacier as a mountain tour (only to be attempted with the right equipment and experience) and along the west arete requiring climbing of UIAA grade II - III sections to the summit. According to the literature the ascent takes about five hours. The Strahlkogel may, however, also be ascended via very difficult climbing routes up the south flank and along the southeast arete. The start point for this approach is the Winnebachsee Hut (2,362 m) above Gries im Sulztal.

Description Hidden Kingdom: A Fantasy-Adventure Game is a fantasy system set in Arthurian times, combining role-playing with strategic conflict and historical simulation. Character alignment is based on the religious and political conflicts of the time. To be truly successful, a player character must follow the rules of Christian knightly conduct. The game includes statistics for over 300 historically based characters, plus a GM's screen. Players are assigned a character and play out that character using the character's given beliefs and values (alignment). The game includes two full color maps of ancient Britain, including Ireland, featuring twenty-one different kingdoms on the islands and hundreds of small baronages. Heraldry is defined for every single character in the game with detailed shields and surcoats. The game also includes political and economic rules as well as general roleplaying. It can be played as a single session, or as a continuous multi-session campaign.

It was built near Brigus Bay, on the Battery (which is named for the gun emplacements that were there in the 1740s during King George's War). The area was also known as Freshwater, as there are several streams which were historically a source of water for sealing fleets. The Pomeroy family used the structure as a dwelling for many years but eventually turned it into a barn.Heritage Web Site, retrieved 28 May 2018 The American artist and writer Rockwell Kent lived in the cottage for about a year and a half in 1914-1915. Trained as an architect, in 1915 he rebuilt the structure and added a studio and second bedroom on the west side. While living in Brigus, Kent made many paintings and prints inspired by the surrounding landscape, many which include depictions of the cottage. There are still several small paintings by Kent on the cottage's interior walls and doors.Canada's Historic Places, retrieved 28 May 2018 In 1930 the cottage was purchased by Albert Edward Harris, an English artist and engineer who had been employed by the Anglo-Newfoundland Development Company. An Englishman, he named the house Kent Cottage after his home county of Kent. Harris restored and expanded the cottage, and sometimes included it in his paintings. After his death in 1933, the cottage was inherited by George White. It remained vacant for twenty years until Rupert Bartlett purchased it. In 1953 Kent Cottage was occupied by Bradley Jacob Folensbee, Jr. (\\"Jake\\"), an American artist, teacher and war veteran. Folensbee purchased the property in 1955, and named it Landfall. He spent summers at the cottage, and until his death in 2004 he invested considerably in preserving and restoring it, including acquiring surrounding land to protect its character. Folensbee bequeathed the property to the Landfall Trust, which now owns and maintains Kent Cottage and the surrounding of land.Landfall Trust of Brigus, Newfoundland and Labrador, retrieved 28 May 2018 The cottage was designated a Registered Heritage Structure in 1988 by the Heritage Foundation of Newfoundland and Labrador.

The final stage work to use his music was another pasticcio, L'Olimpiade, which premiered at the Teatro Marsigli-Rossi di Bologna on 10 May 1755. Besides opera, Brivio produced a small amount of instrumental music. One of his two known violin concertos was included in a well known publication of Italian music by French parliamentarian Pierre Philibert de Blancheton, alongside composers Angelo Maria Scaccia and Carlo Zuccari.

Since 1877, porcelain has been made there entirely by hand. The product range includes lifelike animal and bird sculptures, lovely child figurines, decorative Christmas and gift items, modern vessels in both traditional and modern styles. The family business is being run by the fourth and fifth generation. History Wagner & Apel Porcelain Factory, 2013 In 1877 a porcelain factory was founded in Lippelsdorf with the name of ‚ÄúKUCH & Co.‚Äù The entry in the local register of properties was ‚Äúkiln in town field built [ Brennofen in Ortsflur errichtet ]‚Äù. One of the founders was Bernhard Wagner. Since 31 May 1901, the owner Bernhard Wagner as well as Anton and Bernhard Apel operated under the name, ‚ÄúWagner & Apel‚Äù. With them, the Lippelsdorf porcelain made its name all over the world. In the beginning, the primary focus of the main production were pipe bowls, mugs, egg cups, figurines of bathing children, and other little export goods but, in 1901, it was changed to knick-knacks, animals and gift items. Over the years, the collection expanded to include small commercial items such as cans, ashtrays, salt and pepper shakers, pin cushions, little containers for condiments such as spice, etc. In this way, the factory continued from generation to generation. Like all the medium-sized businesses of the Communist East Germany, Wagner & Apel was made a special company with orders from the state. In 1972, the company was completely nationalized and formed under the name of ‚ÄúVEB Porzellanfiguren Lippelsdorf [ Lippeldsdorf Porcelain Figurines VEB ]‚Äù. Four years later all the porcelain factories in the area were merged to become ‚ÄúVEB Vereinigte Zierporzellanwerke Lichte [ United Animal Porcelain Works of Lichte VEB ]‚Äù. Lippelsdorf then was assigned to its own Production Department of the Gr√§fenthal State Company. The company therefore lost all its independence as well as the power to make its own decisions. After the political changes, the descendants of Bernhard Wagner, Ingeborg Seibert and Helga Koch, requested the re-privatization of the factory, which then went into private ownership on 1 July 1990. The current shareholders of the GmbH ( limited liability company ) are Ingeborg Seibert and Helga Koch, with Hans-Heinrich Seibert as the Managing Director.

To illustrate the process, the old factory was fitted with a multi-story circular stove for burning coal, a mass mill ( for grounding and mixing materials to create clay ) and a steam engine built in 1937. The old porcelain factory was appointed as the showpiece of 19th- century technology. Interested visitors would then have the opportunity of watching the traditional production of porcelain.

History =1st Building= The Royal Pottery Theatre opened on 25 November 1852 in Brunswick Street, Hanley, and was initially run by James Rogers. The building was converted from a Chartist meeting hall, and was originally a Methodist chapel. In 1857, this building was gutted and extended to create a larger venue for 1,400, such was the theatre's success. =2nd Building= In 1870 the old Royal Pottery Theatre; was demolished and the new Theatre Royal and Opera House constructed. Designed by R. Twemlow to a cost of ¬£4,500, it could hold 3,600. The facade of this building can be seen in Brunswick Street today as the entrance to the 'Fiction' nightclub. James Elphinstone took over in 1872, and his family ran the theatre for decades. =3rd Building= Elphinstone obtained plans from Charles J. Phipps and Frank Matcham, renowned theatrical architects, and again rebuilt the venue in 1887. A new auditorium was constructed to the south of the old theatre, which was converted into the stage. Entrance for the 2,600 patrons was still from Brunswick Street until a new entrance block was constructed in Pall Mall, still visible today with additional rendering. Further work took place in 1894 by Frank Matcham to extend the auditorium southwards to increase its capacity, and to install electric light. The theatre mainly featured a mix of drama, opera, and musical comedy until the 1920s when variety became the mainstay. The theatre's 'Hanley Babes', formed from young girls from local dance groups, became synonymous with the annual pantomime. On 2 June 1949, the stage and auditorium of the venue were totally destroyed by fire in the early hours during a run of the Sadler's Wells Ballet. =4th Building= 1951-1961 Work began in 1950 to construct a new theatre in the ruins of the old. Designed by Edward Foresaw and George Greaves. it could hold 1,800 people over three levels. The opening performance was on 14 August 1951, with the national tour of Annie Get Your Gun. The rise of television meant audiences dwindled, and owners Mecca converted the theatre to bingo in 1961 although local amateur dramatics still hired the venue. In 1966 a casino was opened on the stage, ending this practice. 1981-2000 In 1981 Mecca closed the bingo operation, and a local trust purchased the theatre. Following minor renovation it reopened in December 1982 with the pantomime Babes in the Wood. The theatre became moderately successful in the 1980s, producing a number of shows including Cabaret and the legendary UK tour of The Rocky Horror Show. The theatre's finances and management were troubled, suffering numerous lawsuits, bankruptcy hearings and new management teams. Whilst the nearby Regent Theatre obtained funding to be refurbished, local businessman Mike Lloyd purchased the Theatre Royal in 1996 and commenced a full refurbishment and renamed the building 'The Royal'. This too failed, with the building being sold off and gutted in 2000. Purchased by Luminar Leisure, it now houses two nightclubs.

Description Adventures in Fantasy is a fantasy system, similar in many ways to early Dungeons & Dragons. Characters may be warriors or magic-users; magic is handled on a spell-point system. Movement is miniatures-oriented (speed in inches, etc.). Character creation, combat, and setting up campaigns are covered in the \\"Book of Adventure\\" (64 pages); spells and nonhuman races are detailed in the \\"Book of Faerry and Magic\\" (56 pages); and the \\"Book of Creatures and Treasure\\" (56 pages) contains just that. Publication history Adventures in Fantasy was designed by Dave Arneson and Richard Snider. A playtest edition was published by Excalibre Games in 1978 as a limited edition of 164 photocopied pages; each page contains two pages of manuscript printed side by side. Adventures in Fantasy was then published by Excalibre Games Inc. in 1979 as a boxed set containing a 64-page book, two 56-page books, three cardstock sheets, and a die. Arneson bought back rights to Adventures in Fantasy using settlement money from TSR, and his company Adventure Games put out a new edition in 1981. Adventures in Fantasy was one of several games that the Thieves' World RPG (1981) included rules for. Reception Ronald Pehr reviewed Adventures in Fantasy in The Space Gamer No. 30. Pehr commented that \\"D&D; might had 'contradictions and confusions' as Mr. Arneson points out on page 1 of Adventures in Fantasy, and he may be correct that 'Any person without the aid of an experienced player was hard pressed to even begin to gain an understanding of the rules...' However, we now have other games which aren't full of confusion, offer some excellent role-playing, and can be handled by beginners, and don't cost [as much as this game]!\\" Eric Goldberg reviewed Adventures in Fantasy in Ares Magazine #4 and commented that \\"AIF would seem to have many things against purchasing it. The price is high, the graphics are terrible, the rules are worse, and many of the systems are overly complicated. However, when played, the game is a lot of fun. Of course, some of the burdensome rules must be streamlined, but that work is not excessive.\\" Clayton Miner reviewed Adventures in Fantasy for Pegasus magazine #1 (1981). He completed his review by saying: \\"Admittedly, this game does have its fascinations, especially to those who are interested in running a game with the flavor of medieval tales, rather than as Middle Earth. This is a game that should be avoided by those people who derive enjoyment from running a wide variety of character classes, as the only ones available are Warrior and Magic User. It is unfortunate that what could have been a superior project has turned out to be a disappointment in terms of playability and quality.\\" References Category:Fantasy role-playing games Category:Role-playing games introduced in 1978 ","title":"Adventures in Fantasy"},{"id":"45198913","text":"Archaeron is a role-playing game published by Archaeron Games Ltd. in 1980.

Turnbull noted that the game cannot be played without all three volumes, \\"a marked disadvantage if the three volumes are not all published at the same time\\".

He considered the first volume \\"an impressive production\\" and concluded that it was a \\"promising start but the publishers should perhaps have had more confidence in their authors and should have been less slaphappy in the production - there is no excuse at all for such obvious errors\\". Lewis Pulsipher reviewed Bifrost in The Space Gamer No. 57. Pulsipher commented that \\"Few readers of Bifrost will decide to convert to it from their current FRPG, nor is it for novices.

Description Dinky Dungeons is the smallest (3\\" x 4\\") role-playing game ever produced. The very concise rules cover character creation, classes, skills, spells, combat, experience, monsters, and a two-page introductory mini-scenario. The game includes a GM's screen, a hex map, and a sample character sheet. The game utilized six-sided dice (d6 in game parlance). Each character had two attributes, Mental and Physical. There were three classes ‚Äì fighter, wizard, and bard ‚Äì and three optional non-human races ‚Äì elves, dwarves, and \\"Fuzzy-Winkers\\", the latter of which being intelligent, giant rats. The Physical trait governed the size of weapon the fighter could use, which in turn determined how much damage the character could do on a good roll. Mental governed a wizard or bard's spell points and the number of spells they had at their disposal. Conflict resolution was handled by rolling 2d6 and trying to get X or less, where X was the difficulty of a task set by the GM or by a chart that compared the attacker and defender's relative abilities. Where abilities were matched, the player needed to roll a 7 or less for his or her character to succeed.

Built by Piel and Roger Holleville, the CP-10 was a Pou du Ciel style, single seat tandem-wing aircraft, powered by a Mengin B flat-twin engine mounted in the nose with its cylinder heads exposed for cooling and driving a two bladed propeller. The larger, forward wing was mounted above the flat sided fuselage on each side by two pairs of short, inverted-V struts from the fuselage to the wing rotation axis. The angle of incidence was controlled from the open cockpit by long rods from the lower fuselage to the wing underside near the trailing edge. The shorter span rear wing was mounted on top of the fuselage immediately behind the cockpit. The CP-10 had a straight edged fin and rounded, balanced rudder. Each main wheel of its fixed, tail wheel undercarriage was mounted on a hinged V-strut to the lower fuselage and with a shock absorber on a strut to the upper fuselage.

It is best known as the location of a major mining disaster that took place on August 8, 1956 in which 262 men, including a large number of Italian labourers, were killed. Aside from memorials to the disaster, the site features a small woodland park, preserved headframes and buildings, as well as an Industrial Museum and Glass Museum. The museum features on the European Route of Industrial Heritage and is one of the four Walloon mining sites listed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site in 2012. History The history of coal mining on the site of the Bois du Cazier dates back to a concession awarded by royal decree on 30 September 1822; a transcription error caused the name of the site to be changed from Bois de Cazier. After 1898, the site was owned by the charbonnages d'Amerc≈ìur company and operated by the Soci√©t√© anonyme du Charbonnage du Bois du Cazier. The site had two mine shafts reaching and deep. A third shaft, known as the Foraky shaft, was begun in the mid-1950s. By 1955, the mine produced of coal annually and employed a total of 779 workers, many of whom were not Belgian but migrant workers from Italy and elsewhere. They were housed by the mining companies, which in reality meant they moved into Nissen huts in former prisoner of war camps in the region. On the 8 August 1956, a major mining accident occurred and a fire destroyed the mine; 262 workers of 12 nationalities were killed. In the aftermath of the disaster, Italian immigration stopped and mining safety regulations were revised all across Europe and a Mines Safety Commission established. Full production at the Bois du Cazier resumed the following year.Emporis Site du Bois du Cazier Accessed 25 January 2015 The company was liquidated in January 1961 and the mine finally closed in December 1967. It was listed as a national monument on 28 May 1990 and opened as a museum in 2002. =Marcinelle disaster of 1956= View of the two headframes at the Bois du Cazier On 8 August 1956, a major mining disaster occurred at the Bois du Cazier. An accident began at 8:10 AM when the hoist mechanism in one of the shafts was started before the coal wagon had been completely loaded into the cage. Electric cables ruptured, starting an underground fire within the shaft. The moving cage also ruptured oil and air pipes which made the fire worse and destroyed much of the winch mechanism. Smoke and carbon monoxide spread down the mine, killing all the miners trapped by the fire. Despite an attempted rescue from the surface, only 13 of the miners who had been underground at the time of the accident survived. 262 were killed, making the mining accident the worst in Belgian history. Because of the guest worker programme then in force, only 96 killed in the accident were Belgian nationals; in total 12 nationalities were represented among the dead, including 136 Italians. The remains of the last miners, trapped at the bottom of the mine, were only found on 23 August 1956. The excavators famously reported that they were \\"all corpses\\" (tutti cadaveri) inside the mine. The disaster is considered a major moment in Belgian and Italian post-war history and was the subject of a 2003 documentary film, Inferno Below, which won an award at the Festival International de Programmes Audiovisuels. Museums Since March 2002, the Bois du Cazier has been open to the public as a museum complex. Most of the original site of the mine is preserved except the derelict Foraky headframe, dating to the 1960s, which was demolished in 2004. The mine buildings house a small Industrial Museum (Mus√©e d'Industrie), displaying artefacts relating to Belgium's industrial history. The Glass Museum of Charleroi (Mus√©e du Verre de Charleroi) also reopened in the same site in 2007, displaying its collection of historic glassware. There are several spaces with memorials to the 1956 disaster. The slag heaps around the mine have been landscaped and can also be visited by the public. The museum is one of the four sites inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site under the Major Mining Sites of Wallonia listing. It also features on the European Route of Industrial Heritage. In 2006, the Bois du Cazier received 46,000 visitors.

The film was released on April 10, 1921, by Paramount Pictures. Plot Strung around the idea of reincarnation, this film goes back in time to the days of the Spanish galleons and pirates burying their treasure; treasure to be found centuries later.

The theme of reincarnation was rare for the time. This was the first film in which Davies played a dual role: She plays the modern-day Pauline as well as the Spanish Lucia. This was also the first Davies production to be filmed on the West Coast, with several scenes filmed on Catalina. The prologue to the film shows Davies as a cavewoman, an Egyptian princess, a medieval damsel, and as Lucia.Lorusso, Edward (2017) The Silent Films of Marion Davies, CreateSpace, pp. 40-50.

That day, the ship departed for Sandy Hook. During the first week, the crew ran out of tobacco. The captain had only enough for himself and did not share. By the 31st, The ship was at , going down the Channel against the headwinds, when the captain came on deck and ordered the ship about. The new crew fouled the braces, likely deliberately. The captain called out that the men were \\"not sailors, but soldiers\\". =Mutiny= At that point, Caladis stabbed the captain in the face and slashed his belly. Though wounded, the captain hit back with his fists and Caladis stabbed him again. Cargalis and the rest of the new crew arrived, and he stabbed the captain twice in the neck. Macdonald begged Canesso to spare him, but he was pushed away, and Caladis stabbed him twice. Wortley climbed the fore-rigging in an attempt to escape, but Cacaris, a Turk, shot at him from below and Kaida climbed above and also shot at him. They both fired a total of five times, causing Wortley to fall to the deck, where Cargalis nearly severed his head. Van Hoydonck attempted to give aid, but realised it was futile and stayed in his cabin. The crew weighted the three corpses and pitched them overboard. The boatswain then confronted Van Hoydonck and Trousselot. They told them that they wished to get to Greece via Gibraltar. One of the crew had a rich uncle there, and they would scuttle the ship. Van Hoydonck agreed and came up on deck, which was liberally splashed with blood. He made two watches, with himself and Canesso. The crew scrubbed the deck and removed the ship's name. Van Hoydonck tried to set course for Lundy's Island, but Renken was wise. Being clever, he steered south and east, in the general direction of Gibraltar, but also of France. A schooner was sighted the next day, but he was made to veer away. On November 4, he brought the ship into the bay of Sables d'Olonne. Caladis was suspicious, but agreed to a night's anchorage. He wrote a note in French and English about their situation, asking for help. They secretly dropped them overboard, hoping they would be found. Three were and one was produced at trial. At 5 the next morning, they set sail, despite a headwind. Then Van Hoydonck refused to navigate further. Petersen tried, but was incompetent. For the next two days they wandered lost. Then Van Hoydonck was called back on the evening of the 6th, but under condition that they would anchor at the next port he found. This was the Roads of La Flotte, where they anchored on the evening of November 7, telling the Greeks they were at C√°diz. In the night he made 20 copies of the previous note and put them overboard. He also hoisted the ensign, union down, a signal of distress. A Frenchman, R√©de, who had earlier steered the ship in, noticed the flag and came close to inquire. The flag was hauled down and Van Hoydonck was forced below. Cargalis acted as captain and made excuses. Their manner was suspicious, and he reported the ship to the Prefect of Marine. On November 9, they asked Van Hoydonck what country it was and he told them it was a free republic with no police. Six went ashore in the longboat, with the clothing and effects of the murdered men. They said that they were shipwrecked sailors, but this was revealed as false and they were arrested. Angelos cracked and told the truth. On the morning of November 10, a gunboat came alongside and told Van Hoydonck to send off his boat. He was resisted and drove the men in at the point of a pistol. After hearing Van Hoydonck's story, he sent him ashore to talk with the police and later gave him 10 armed sailors to arrest the remaining mutineers.  Trial  After 6 weeks deliberations, the French courts surrendered jurisdiction and the crew was returned to London for trial at the Old Bailey. They were tried first by Sir Thomas Henry, but later by Mr Justice Brett (Lord Esher). During the trial, the remains of the corpses of the murdered men washed up on the French coast. Van Hoydonck was sent to view them. They consisted of three heads, and one headless body. The fishermen who found the heads had buried them, and were unable to locate them again. The body was badly decomposed, and had been stabbed 16 times. It is supposed to be that of Stanley Hatfield. Cargalis, Caladis, Cacaris, and Kaida were found guilty and hanged at Newgate on May 23, 1876. The rest were released. =Aftermath= The Lennie was taken to La Rochelle and then to Nantes from which she sailed with a new crew. Justice Brett praised the actions of Van Hoydonck and ordered ¬£50 paid to him for his conduct. The Aristocratic Order of St. John of Jerusalem awarded him a silver medal and Trousselot a bronze one. He later wrote a book about his experiences and worked as a gate-man at the Antwerp docks. Van Hoydonck owned a pub in Middlesex for a time, but was bankrupt by 1892. Trousselot received the Legion of Honour from France and later moved to New Zealand, where he and others are remembered for aiding a double shipwreck in Timaru in May 1882.

It contains Country and Western music, often with a big band twist, and features arrangements by Jimmie Haskell, Shorty Rogers and Gerald Wilson. The title track was a number three hit single. The album reached number 43 on the Billboard 200 chart. The album was built around the You're the Reason I'm Living single. This (along with the flip-side, Now You're Gone) was recorded on December 3, 1962. When the single became a bit hit, a decision was made to build an album of country songs around it. These new songs were recorded on January 13-15, 1963. It was the first time that Darin had consciously built an album around a hit single - Things and Other Things, featuring the hit Things, had been simply a pick-up album of leftovers released to cash-in on the single success. The production and release of You're the Reason I'm Living album had a knock-on effect on Darin's intended release schedule. Earthy!, his album of folk songs from around the world, had been slated for release in February 1963 (and Darin had been promoting it on TV appearances), but was pushed back to July of that year. Who Can I Count On is notable for being a duet with Merry Clayton (aka Mary Clayton), and was her first professional recording. Reception On release, BIllboard magazine called the album a \\"powerhouse package,\\" and TV Radio Mirror said in their review that \\"Bobby certainly did these tunes up right.\\" Music critic Richie Unterberger called the release \\"a merely fair album that reflected a trend of the day.

Starring by Ismail Yaseen and Omar El- Hariri, the film is based upon an actual 1947 news article about a woman-to- man instance but with the gender switch reversed to be man-to-woman for comedy effect. Miss Hanafi is listed among the most important 100 films in the history of Egyptian cinema. In his book Dream Makers on the Nile, author Mustafa Darwish called it Ismail Yasseen's \\"most famous and funniest film\\". Plot Working class Hassan (Omar al-Hariri) and the rich Hanafi are rivals for Nawaeim's (Magda) love. Going to the hospital to be treated for a horrible wedding night stomach pain, Hanafi receives an accidental sex change operation. After months of recuperation, he tries to pick up the pieces of his life as an unattractive, mannish woman named Fifi. She becomes the opposite of Hanafi. Where he was brusque, she is flirtatious. Cast * Ismail Yasseen as Hanafi / Fifi * Omar El-Hariri as Hassan * Magda as Nawaem * Wedad Hamdy as Zakia * Suleiman Naguib as Hassona * Abdel Fatah Al Kasri * Zeinat Sedki Reception Mada Masr praised the film, calling it one of Egypt's cinematic gems. The expanded that the film \\"breaks every social norm and cinematic clich√© of its time. Boy loves girl, boy chases girl, boy sings about girl‚Äôs beautiful eyes, and finally boy marries girl. But in Miss Hanafi the boy is the girl! And he/she chooses celibacy and scolds those who chose to marry.\\" They also explained that while other films of the 1950s might have had story lines where the men dressed as women, this one was \\"unusual in its progressive questioning around gender because it is very early, very funny, not particularly political, and it‚Äôs set in a working-class neighborhood.\\" The Al- Hanager Arts Centre in Cairo celebrated the work of director Fettin Abdel- Wahab as part of the 2007 Egyptian Centennials exhibition, noting him as a pioneer of the social comedy school of Egyptian cinema, and his film Miss Hanfi as among the most frequently watched and influential.

The company launched in July 2005 and provides 3G and 4G mobile phone services. Three's former holding company, Hutchison Whampoa, acquired O2 Ireland in June 2013, and the company was fully merged into the operations of Three Ireland in March 2015. History A 3 Store, Grafton St, Dublin. Three launched on 26 July 2005 as Ireland's fourth mobile network operator behind Vodafone, O2 and Meteor. Service was initially offered as post-paid only, but on 16 May 2006 the introduction of a pre-paid service, known as 3Pay, was announced. A pre-paid mobile broadband service was launched on 29 February 2008 under the name 3Pay Broadband, with vouchers available for durations of one day, one week, or one month. On 13 May 2010, Three announced the launch of the world's first commercial voice and data I-HSPA network. In August 2010, Three Ireland admitted it has been overstating its subscriber numbers since 2006. As per its latest released mid year statements about 56 per cent of Three's 554,000 registered subscribers are considered active. This is about 244,000 short of the figure supplied to ComReg.https://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/finance/2010/0827/1224277688438.html On 24 June 2013, it was announced that Hutchison would acquire Telef√≥nica's Irish mobile operations, O2 for ‚Ç¨780 million, to be merged into Three Ireland upon completion of the deal. The European Commission approved the merger in 2014. The O2 brand was phased out and its operations fully merged into Three on 2 March 2015. Network Three has a licence for operation in Ireland using the access code 083, although numbers can be ported over from other networks. Three uses both 3G and 4G LTE networks in Ireland, along with the 2G network acquired with the purchase of O2. As Three's original infrastructure was purely 3G/HSDPA. For a while, they provided 2G/EDGE coverage (a) under a strategic partnership with Vodafone announced in July 2012, and (b) through the acquisition of O2 Ireland's 2G network in 2015, however, roaming on Vodafone is no longer supported, and 2G is natively supported with the acquisition of O2 and it's 3G & 2G networks. =4G= In November 2012, Three was awarded LTE spectrum by auction, along with the three other incumbent network operators.http://press.three.ie/press_releases/913/ On 27 January 2014, Three launched their 4G network in Dublin, Cork, Galway, Limerick, Wexford and Waterford. In March 2014, Three expanded their 4G coverage to Ashbourne, Bray, Carlow, Dunmore East, Kilkenny, Leixlip, Lusk, Rush, Skerries, Swords and Tullamore. In March 2016, Three Ireland announced that it is now offering Free 4G for Life to all its customers. Previously, Three offered free 4G to all its customers up to a certain date at which point the company would review and possibly extend that date further. Three's upgrade programme \\"the big upgrade\\" aimed to provide 99% 4G coverage by early 2017, although that never came to fruition, and instead three has 97% 3G coverage, along with less than 90% 4G coverage, making Three's 4G network both the smallest, and also the slowest in Ireland, according to Ookla, and Rootmetrics in 2018. =4G+/LTE Advanced= Three have announced they will be rolling out 4G+ to their customers offering faster Peak Speeds of 225 Mbit/s. Three say 4G+ is already available in Dublin and will be rolled out to the rest of the country by the end of April 2016. Three are offering 4G+ to all Customers with compatible handsets. Three's 4G network has suffered many setbacks, and 4G coverage currently sits at under 90% in March 2018. Sponsorships On 5 August 2010, Three Ireland announced a four-year, ‚Ç¨7,500,000 deal with the Football Association of Ireland to become the primary sponsor of all Republic of Ireland international football teams. In 2015, Three renewed the sponsorship for a further five years. Following Hutchison Whampoa's acquisition of O2 Ireland, The O2 was renamed 3Arena in 2014.

Early work was done by Derek Barton and co-workers to illustrate the biosynthetic pathways towards erythrina alkaloids. It was demonstrated that erysodienone could be synthesized from simple starting materials by a similar approach as its biosynthetic pathway, which led to the development of the biomimetic synthesis of erysodienone. Synthesis The biosynthesis of erysodienone involves a key step of oxidative phenol coupling. Starting with S-norprotosinomenine precursor A, cyclization via oxidative phenol coupling forms intermediate B, which in turn can be rearranged to form intermediate C. Hydrogenation of C forms the diphenoquinone intermediate E. An intramolecular Michael addition reaction converts E to the final product, erysodienone. :Proposed biosynthetic pathway of erysodienone A biomimetic synthesis route for erysodienone was developed based on a similar oxidative phenol coupling mechanism. Barton and co-workers found that treating bisphenolethylamine precursor F with oxidants such as K3Fe(CN)6 initiated oxidative phenol coupling to form the 9-membered ring structure in intermediate D that itself undergo a Michael addition to give erysodienone. :Biomimetic synthesis of erysodienone References Further reading * * Category:Alkaloids ","title":"Erysodienone"},{"id":"45199487","text":"Isaac Namioka Isaac Namioka (April 25, 1928 - September 25, 2019) was a Japanese-American mathematician who worked in general topology and functional analysis.

He died at home in Seattle on September 25, 2019, retrieved 2019-10-16. Early life and education Namioka was born in T≈çno, not far from Namioka in the north of Honshu, Japan. When he was young his parents moved farther south, to Himeji.. He attended graduate school at the University of California, Berkeley, earning a doctorate in 1956 under the supervision of John L. Kelley. As a graduate student, Namioka married Chinese-American mathematics student Lensey Namioka, later to become a well-known novelist who used Namioka's Japanese heritage in some of her novels. Career Namioka taught at Cornell University until 1963, when he moved to the University of Washington. There he was the doctoral advisor to four students. He has over 20 academic descendants, largely through his student Joseph Rosenblatt, who became a professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign. Contributions Namioka's book Linear Topological Spaces with Kelley has become a \\"standard text\\". Although his doctoral work and this book both concerned general topology, his interests later shifted to functional analysis.. With Asplund in 1967, Namioka gave one of the first complete proofs of the Ryll-Nardzewski fixed-point theorem.. Following his 1974 paper \\"separate continuity and joint continuity\\", a Namioka space has come to mean a topological space X with the property that whenever Y is a compact space and function f from the Cartesian product of X and Y to Z is separately continuous in X and Y, there must exist a dense GŒ¥ set within X whose Cartesian product with Y is a subset of the set of points of continuity of f.. The result of the 1974 paper, a proof of this property for a specific class of topological spaces, has come to be known as Namioka's theorem. In 1975, Namioka and Phelps established one side of the theorem that a space is an Asplund space if and only if its dual space has the Radon‚ÄìNikod√Ωm property. The other side was completed in 1978 by Stegall.. Awards and honors A special issue of the Journal of Mathematical Analysis and Applications was dedicated to Namioka to honor his 80th birthday..

He was best known for battle scenes, hence his nickname. Biography His father was a building contractor employed by the B√¢timents du Roi.Dictionnaire critique de biographie et d'histoire He began his career in the workshops of the late Laurent de La Hyre, and later worked as a draftsman for S√©bastien Le Prestre de Vauban,Enciclopedia online Larousse by whose introduction he became apprenticed to Adam Frans van der Meulen. His style soon came to be almost indistinguishable from Van der Meulen's and, after the latter's death in 1690, Martin and (another artist who specialized in battle scenes) were charged with completing a series of paintings honoring the achievements of King Louis XIV. That same year, partly in recognition of this work, he was appointed Director of the Gobelins Manufactory, succeeding Van der Meulen.Enciclopedia online Treccani After Lecomte's premature death in 1695, Martin began to collaborate with Pierre-Denis Martin who (depending on the source consulted) may have been his cousin, nephew or brother. In 1699, they completed a new series of works lauding the achievements of the King, which was installed at the Ch√¢teau de Marly. At this point, he became the official painter for the King's campaigns against the Protestants in Dauphin√©, the Siege of Mons and the Siege of Namur. As a result of his position at Gobelins, many of his drawings and paintings were used for tapestries. He also executed frescoes for four rooms at the H√¥tel des Invalides ( vedute depicting fortresses in the Netherlands, Flanders and Alsace). In 1710, he was commissioned by Leopold, Duke of Lorraine, to create a series of works depicting the life of Leopold's father, Charles V, for the Ch√¢teau de Lun√©ville. Although famous for painting battles, he also produced landscapes, portraits, still-lifes and historical scenes and helped to reorganize the tapestry manufactory in Nancy.

Tan later completed an M.S. in nuclear engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the U.S. Tan began Ph.D. studies in the subject at MIT, but because the 1979 Three Mile Island accident caused a sharp reduction in opportunities in the nuclear industry, Tan left MIT and transferred to the University of San Francisco, where he graduated with an MBA. Business career Tan was a manager at EDS Nuclear and ECHO Energy and partner at the Walden USA investment fund before founding venture capital firm Walden International in 1987. He named the firm after the book Walden by Henry David Thoreau because Tan's goal was to be like Thoreau: \\"contrarian, rather than just following the trend.\\" Growing from $20 million upon its founding to $2 billion by 2001, Walden International has focused its investments on semiconductor, alternative energy, and digital media businesses and startups in the U.S. and Asia such as Ambarella Inc., Creative Technology, S3 Graphics, and Sina Corp. For Tan's breakthrough investments in Asian tech startups, Forbes dubbed Tan \\"the pioneer of Asian VC\\" in 2001. On February 10, 2004, the Cadence Design Systems board of directors elected Tan to the board. Tan became interim co-CEO in October 2008 following the resignation of Michael Fister in October 2008. The Cadence board formally named Tan president and CEO effective January 8, 2009. Under Tan's leadership, Cadence grew its net worth to $1.3 billion by 2012, including $440 million in that year alone. Cadence also expanded its Shanghai office in 2012.

(b) Detailed steps for the reaction. Structure of the ligand and the proposed transition state for the key addition reaction are shown. Asymmetric addition of alkenylmetals to aldehydes is a chemical reaction in enantioselective synthesis that reacts an alkenylmetal with an aldehyde to give an allyl alcohol (Figure \\"Asymmetric addition of alkenylmetals to aldehydes\\"). The stereoselectivity in the reaction is typically controlled by the asymmetric ligands used providing a strategy to introduce controlled asymmetry into the molecule.D. M√ºller, A.

J. 19, 15226‚Äì15239 (2013). Controlled molecular asymmetry (or enantioselectivity) is crucial for controlling the bioactivity of the synthesized molecules and demanded by drug authorities in drug synthesis. In this case the ligands chelate to the transition metal to create a chiral environment which enables the selective formation of a particular enantiomer. Various transition metals such as Zinc, Nickel, Chromium, and Rhodium have been used in this reaction. Asymmetric addition of alkenylmetals to aldehydes has been widely used in total synthesis of natural product. For example, the key cyclization step in the total synthesis of (R)-(-)-Muscone was an intramolecular asymmetric addition of a vinylzinc derivative to an aldehyde using a chiral amino-isoborneol ligand (Figure \\"(a) Asymmetric addition of alkenylzinc to aldehyde in the total synthesis of muscone\\").Oppolzer, W.; Radinov, R. N., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993, 115, 1593. The reaction used a terminal alkyne (A) as the substrate which generated alkenylborate reagent (B) through monohydroboration reaction. After transmetalation with diethylzinc, the generated alkenylzinc reagent (C) further reacted with the aldehyde (D) through exclusive addition to the œÄ-face under the control of (-)-3-exo-(dimethylamino)isoborneol (DAIB) as a ligand (Figure \\"(b) Detailed steps for the reaction\\").

Raised and educated in New England, he moved to California and served a two-year term in the California State Assembly. French followed his time as a legislator with nine years as Chief Justice on the Arizona Territorial Supreme Court. Biography French was born on August 22, 1822, in Berkley, Massachusetts. His father, Ephiram French, and grandfather, James French, were both ship captains involved with cargo vessels. He was educated in private academies and by private tutors before graduating from Brown University in 1842. After graduation, he taught in local schools while continuing his study of law. French also apprenticed in the offices of several attorneys, including those of Benjamin R. Curtis. After admission to the Massachusetts bar in 1848, French practiced in Dedham. He married Abby Ann Haskell. In January 1851, French moved to California. He brought with him letters of recommendation from Daniel Webster and Justice Curtis. He initially practiced law in Placer County, California, before moving to Sacramento, California, in 1854. French served as a trustee of the California State Library from 1866 till 1870 and represented Sacramento in the California State Assembly for a two-year term beginning in 1871. While in the legislature, French was chairman of both the committee on codes and the state library committee. Based upon a recommendation by the California Congressional delegation, French was nominated to become Chief Justice of Arizona by President Ulysses S. Grant on December 13, 1875, and confirmed by the United States Senate three days later. He brought his wife and children with him to Arizona Territory. Initially assigned to the first district, French split his time between Tucson and Florence. While serving on the bench, the Chief Justice gained an unusual reputation of rarely leaving his district except when substituting for a colleague in another district. French's wife died from cancer on December 11, 1879, while escorting the couple's children back east to attend college. As his first four-year term was set to expire, there was universal support in the Arizona press for French's reappointment. President Rutherford B. Hayes responded by nominating him for a second term on December 1, 1879. French desired a transfer to northern Arizona. Justice William Henry Stilwell, who was initially assigned to the northern district upon his appointment, had no objections to a switch so French was transferred to the third district by the 11th Arizona Territorial Legislature. Following the transfer, the Chief Justice made his home in Prescott. From the time he took the bench until 1883, all surviving supreme court decisions in the Arizona Register were authored by French. The majority of cases from this period deal with procedural issues. Examples include Fleury v. Jackson and Tompkins, 1 Arizona 361 (1887) which denied an appeal because the request was submitted after the allotted time for such action had expired and French's affirmation of the lower court's ruling in Territory v. Selden, 1 Arizona 381 (1879) because the appeal did not include a bill of exceptions. In Cole v. Bean, 1 Arizona 377 (1878), the Chief Justice found that an expert was not needed to testify as to the effects of liquor upon a person. Mining cases also appeared frequently on the docket. Examples include a wrongful death case in Lopez v. Central Arizona Mining Company, 1 Arizona 464 (1883) and Field V. Gray, 1 Arizona 404 (1881) which dealt with a title dispute. While serving on the bench, French was witness to an infamous instance of courtroom violence. On December 3, 1883, French was hearing a water-rights case when the attorney for the plaintiff, Attorney General Clark Churchill, called the opposing counsel, Charles B. Rush, a liar. Rush responded by throwing an inkwell at Churchill and then attacking him physically. The court reporter, Buckey O'Neill, came to Churchill's aid as a brawl broke out within the courtroom. Defendant Patrick McAteer, who was testifying at the time the fight began, drew a large knife and joined the fray. During the struggle, a shot from a revolver struck the kerosene lamp illuminating the courtroom, extinguishing the room's primary light source. By the time order was restored there were multiple people injured, several with knife wounds. A seventy-year-old man, wounded in the fight had to have his arm amputated. McAteer was struck in the side by a bullet and died from his wound a month later. As his second term came to an end, there were widespread calls for French's reappointment. There are no records showing why President Chester A. Arthur decided not to return him for a third term. After leaving the bench, he opened a private legal practice in Prescott. In his later years, French was reunited with \\"the love of his youth\\". On April 29, 1886, he married Nancy LeCroft Manney. She was seriously ill at the time and died on June 14, 1886. Around 1890, the former Chief Justice moved back to Sacramento. French died in San Francisco on August 13, 1891.

He was considered one of Libya's leading rabbis and is credited with laying the foundation for that community's development into one of \\"sages, scribes, and kabbalists\\". He is the author of Ma'aseh Rokea·∏• (), a four-volume commentary on Maimonides Mishneh Torah. Biography Mas'ud Hai Rakka·∏• was born in Smyrna, Turkey, the son of Aharon Rakka·∏•. According to the Encyclopaedia Judaica, he was likely descended from the Rakka·∏• family of Venice, and married the daughter of Isaac Rakkah. In his youth, he studied under Rabbi Yitzhak Hacohen Rappaport and Rabbi Hayyim Abulafia, developing into a Talmid Chacham of note. He emigrated to Jerusalem with his teacher, Rabbi Rappaport. When the Jerusalem community experienced difficult economic times, it dispatched shadarim (rabbinical emissaries) to collect funds from the Jewish diaspora. Rakka·∏• was chosen to travel to Jewish communities in North Africa. He set out for Tunisia, Morocco, and Libya, and upon arriving in Tripoli, sent letters to the communities of Venice and Livorno before visiting them as well. Rakka·∏• arrived in Venice in 1729 and stayed for two years. He next traveled to Livorno, residing there from 1731 to 1736 and serving as one of the city's leaders. The Libyan Jewish community at that time was at a spiritual nadir. Upon Rakka·∏•'s return to Tripoli in 1749, the community leaders asked him to stay and lead them. Rakka·∏• agreed and was appointed Av Beit Din (head of the rabbinical court) and Chief Rabbi of Tripoli. He opened a yeshiva in Tripoli and exerted a strong influence on all Libyan Jews. Rakka·∏• was considered one of Libya's leading rabbis. He trained students who became the future hakhamim and dayanim (rabbinical judges) of North African Jewry, including Hakhamim Nathan Adadi (his son-in-law), Shalom Flus, Moshe Lachmish, Binyamin Vaturi, and David Tayyar. Rakka·∏•'s descendants further built the Libyan Jewish community, including his great-grandson, Abraham Hayyim Adadi, Av Beit Din of Tripoli, and his great-great-grandson, Jacob Rakkah, a leading Sephardi posek (arbiter of Jewish law) and author of approximately 40 sefarim. Rakka·∏• served the Libyan Jewish community for 20 years until his death on July 24, 1768 (10 Av 5528) at the age of 78. He is buried in Tripoli.

After the bus he boarded had driven about 400 metres, the Palestinian attacked the driver, who fought back, before turning to other passengers and attacking them. The bus stopped, with the passengers fleeing, and the Palestinian attacked others too. Israeli police shot the terrorist in the foot and arrested him. Twelve people were injured in the attack. Attacks At 7:30 am the assailant boarded a bus in Tel Aviv about 7:30 a.m. and rode two stops before attacking the driver with a knife. The driver, Herzl Biton, fought back, using pepper spray. The assailant attacked a number of passengers with the knife before they were able to open the doors of the bus and flee. The assailant pursued the fleeing passengers, stabbing one a second time, before he attempted to flee the scene. As the assailant attempted to run away, bystanders who happened to be employees of the Israeli prison system gave chase, firing into the air. When the fleeing assailant did not stop, they shot him in the legs and captured him. Perpetrator The stabbing attack was carried out by Hamza Muhammad Hassan Matrouk, (23) an illegal immigrant worker from Al Jib in the . His parents are divorced and his father resides in Tulkarem. Residents of Tulkarem who knew the suspect stated that he was not affiliated with any political party. =Trial and sentencing= Matrouk was a \\"lone wolf\\" who told the court that he had been motivated by watching radical Islamic programs on TV; he spoke of, ‚Äúreaching paradise.‚Äù Noting that the suspect was unrepentant and showed no empathy for his victims, Judge Yaron Levi, of the Tel Aviv District court sentenced Matrouk to 28 years in prison. Context Ths stabbing was the first violent incident in Tel Aviv since the November 2014 Killing of Sergeant Almog Shiloni. The New York Times characterized this attack as representing a new category of threat to Israelis, \\"attacks carried out with seeming spontaneity by individuals acting without the instruction or backing of an organization.\\" Response Hamas leaders praised the attack, calling it a, \\"natural reaction\\" on the part of an occupied people. Mousa Mohammed Abu Marzook said, \\"there is no bigger terrorism than occupying people, stealing their lands, freedom and dignity.\\" The Popular Resistance Committees responded by asserting that, \\"Resistance attacks will not stop.\\" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu denounced the attack as a direct result of incitement by the Palestinian Authority of president Mahmoud Abbas, \\"The attack in Tel Aviv is a direct result of poisonous incitement from the Palestinian Authority towards Jews and their state.

If the overall power consumption is proportional to the computer's utilization, then the machine is said to be energy proportional. Equivalently stated, for an idealized energy proportional computer, the overall energy per operation (a measure of energy efficiency) is constant for all possible workloads and operating conditions. The concept was first proposed in 2007 by Google engineers Luiz Andr√© Barroso and Urs H√∂lzle, who urged computer architects to design servers that would be much more energy efficient for the datacenter setting. Energy proportional computing is currently an area of active research, and has been highlighted as an important design goal for cloud computing. There are many technical challenges remaining in the design of energy proportional computers. Furthermore, the concept of energy proportionality is not inherently restricted to computing. Although countless energy efficiency advances have been made in non-computing disciplines, they have not been evaluated rigorously in terms of their energy proportionality. Background in energy sustainability Sustainable energy is the ideal that society should serve its energy needs without negatively impacting future generations, and which various organizations, governments, and individuals have been advocating. To meet this ideal, efficiency improvements are required in three aspects of the energy ecosystem: * Energy generation * Energy storage * Energy consumption Since our need for energy generation and storage are driven by our demand, more efficient ways of consuming energy can drive large improvements in energy sustainability. Efforts in sustainable energy consumption can be classified at a high level by the three following categories: * Recycle: Capture and recover wasted energy to do more work, that would otherwise be lost as heat. * Reuse: Amortize the cost of energy generation, storage, and delivery by sharing energy and its infrastructure among different loads. * Reduce: Reduce demand for energy by doing more work with less energy (improve consumption efficiency), or not doing the work at all by changing behavior. Many efforts in making energy consumption more sustainable are focused on the \\"reduce\\" theme for unpredictable and dynamic workloads (which are commonly encountered in computing). This can be considered as power management. These efforts can be lumped into two general approaches, which are not specific to computing, but commonly applied in that domain: * Idle power-down: This technique exploits gaps in workload demand to shut off components that are idle. When shut down, components cannot do any useful work. The problems unique to this approach are: (1) it costs time and energy to transition between active and idle power-down states, (2) no work can be done in the off state, so power-up must be done to handle a request, and (3) predicting idle periods and adapting appropriately by choosing the right power state at any moment is difficult. * Active performance scaling: Unlike idle-power down, this approach allows work to be done in any state, all of which are considered active, but with different power/performance tradeoffs. Usually, slower modes consume less power. The problems unique to this approach are: (1) it is difficult to determine which combination of states is the most energy efficient for an application, and (2) the energy efficiency improvements are usually not as lucrative as those from idle power-down modes. In practice, both types of approaches are used commonly and mixed together. Motivation for energy proportionality Until about 2010, computers were far from energy proportional for two primary reasons. A critical issue is high static power, which means that the computer consumes significant energy even when it is idle. High static power is common in servers owing to their architectural, circuit, and manufacturing optimizations that favor very high performance instead of low power. High static power relative to the maximum loaded power results in low dynamic range, poor energy proportionality, and thus, very low efficiency at low to medium utilizations. This can be acceptable for traditional high-performance computing systems and workloads, which try to extract the maximum utilization possible out of the machines, where they are most efficient. However, in modern datacenters that run popular and large- scale cloud computing applications, servers spend most of their time around 30% utilization, and are rarely running under maximum load, which is a very energy-inefficient operating point for typical servers. The second major reason is that the various hardware operating states for power management can be difficult to use effectively. This is because deeper low power states tend to have larger transition latency and energy costs than lighter low power states. For workloads that have frequent and intermittent bursts of activity, such as web search queries, this prevents the use of deep lower power states without incurring significant latency penalties, which may be unacceptable for the application. Energy proportional computer hardware could solve this problem by being efficient at mid-utilization levels, in addition to efficient peak performance and idle states (which can afford to use deep low power sleep modes). However, achieving this goal will require many innovations in computer architecture, microarchitecture, and perhaps circuits and manufacturing technology. The ultimate benefit would be improved energy efficiency, which would allow for cheaper computer hardware, datacenter provisioning, power utility costs, and overall total cost of ownership (TCO). Research in energy proportional computing Since Barroso and H√∂lzle's 2007 paper in IEEE Computer, many researchers have begun to address the problem of energy proportional computing in a variety of ways and in different components. =CPU= The CPU was the first and most obvious place for researchers to focus on for energy efficiency and low power. This is because traditionally it has been the biggest consumer of power in computers. Owing to many innovations in low power technology, devices, circuits, microarchitecture, and electronic design automation, today's CPUs are now much improved in energy efficiency. This has led to the situation where CPUs no longer dominate energy consumption in a computer. Some more well-known examples of the many innovations in CPU energy efficiency include the following: * Clock gating:V. Tiwari, D. Singh, S. Rajgopal, G. Mehta, R. Patel, and F.

Mittal, ACM JETC, 2015 The supply voltage of the processor is adjusted statically or dynamically to achieve different power/reliability/performance tradeoffs. * Dynamic voltage/frequency scaling (DVFS):S.

Available: http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=1283780.1283790 Both voltage and frequency are varied dynamically to achieve better power/performance tradeoffs than either DFS or DVS alone can provide. Note that all of the above innovations for CPU power consumption preceded Barroso and H√∂lzle's paper on energy proportionality. However, most of them have contributed some combination of the two broad types of power management mentioned above, namely, idle power-down and active performance scaling. These innovations have made CPUs scale their power relatively well in relation to their utilization, making them the most energy-proportional of computer hardware components. Unlike CPUs, most other computer hardware components lack power management controls, especially those that enable active performance scaling. CPUs are touted as a good example of energy-proportional computer engineering that other components should strive to emulate. =Memory= Memory was cited as one of the major system components that has traditionally been very energy disproportional. Memory tends to have relatively high static power due to extremely high transistor counts and densities. Furthermore, because memory is often left idle either due to cache-friendly workloads or low CPU utilization, a large proportion of energy use is due to the static power component. Traditionally, dynamic voltage and frequency scaling on main memory DRAM has not been possible due to limitations in the DDR JEDEC standards. However, these limitations exist because the conventional wisdom in memory design is that large design margins are needed for good yield under worst-case manufacturing process variations, voltage fluctuations, and temperature changes. Thus, scaling voltage and frequency, which is commonly done in CPUs, is considered difficult, impractical, or too risky for data corruption to apply in memories. Nevertheless, DVFS has been recently proposed for the DDR3 memory bus interface independently by two research groups in 2011Q. Deng, D. Meisner, L. Ramos, T. F. Wenisch, and R. Bianchini, \\"MemScale: active low- power modes for main memory,\\" ACM SIGPLAN Notices, vol. 46, no. 3, pp. 225‚Äì238, Feb. 2011. [Online]. Available: http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1961296.1950392H. David, C. Fallin, E. Gorbatov, U. R. Hanebutte, and O. Mutlu, \\"Memory power management via dynamic voltage/frequency scaling,\\" in Proceedings of the 8th ACM international conference on Autonomic computing - ICAC ‚Äô11. New York, New York, USA: ACM Press, Jun. 2011, p. 31. [Online]. Available: http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1998582.1998590 to scale memory power with throughput. Because the memory bus voltage and frequency are independent of internal DRAM timings and voltages, scaling this interface should have no effect on memory cell integrity. Furthermore, David et al. claim their approach improves energy proportionality because the memory bus consumes a lot of static power that is independent of the bus utilization. Another research group proposed trading off memory bandwidth for lower energy per bit and lower power idle modes in servers by using mobile-class LPDDR2 DRAMs. This would increase memory energy proportionality without affecting performance for datacenter workloads that are not sensitive to memory bandwidth. The same group also proposed redesigning the DDR3 interface to better support energy proportional server memory without sacrificing peak bandwidth.K. T. Malladi, I. Shaeffer, L. Gopalakrishnan, D. Lo, B. C. Lee, and M. Horowitz, \\"Rethinking DRAM Power Modes for Energy Proportionality,\\" in 2012 45th Annual IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture. IEEE, Dec. 2012, pp. 131‚Äì142. [Online]. Available: http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2457472.2457492 =Networks= Networks are emphasized as a key component that are very energy disproportional and contribute to poor cluster and datacenter-level energy proportionality, especially as other components in a server and datacenter become more energy proportional. The main reason they are not energy proportional is because networking elements are conventionally always on due to the way routing protocols are designed, and the unpredictability of message traffic. Clearly, links cannot be shut down entirely when not in use due to the adverse impact this would make on routing algorithms (the links would be seen as faulty or missing, causing bandwidth and load balancing issues in the larger network). Furthermore, the latency and energy penalties that are typically incurred from switching hardware to low power modes would likely degrade both overall network performance and perhaps energy. Thus, like in other systems, energy proportionality of networks will require the development of active performance scaling features, that do not require idle power-down states to save energy when utilization is low. In recent years, efforts in green networking have targeted energy-efficient Ethernet (including the IEEE 802.3az standard), and many other wired and wireless technologies. A common theme is overall power reduction by low idle power and low peak power, but their evaluation in terms of energy proportionality at the link, switch, router, cluster, and system-levels are more limited. Adaptive link rate is a popular method for energy-aware network links. Some authors have proposed that to make datacenter networks more energy proportional, the routing elements need greater power dynamic range. They proposed the use of the flattened butterfly topology instead of the common folded Clos network in use in datacenters (also known as the fat tree) to improve overall power efficiency, and to use adaptive link rates to adjust link power in relation to utilization. They also propose predicting future link utilization to scale data rates in anticipation. Nevertheless, to make networks more energy proportional, improvements need to be made at several layers of abstraction. =Storage and databases= Data storage is another category of hardware that has traditionally been very energy disproportional. Although storage technologies are non-volatile, meaning that no power is required to retain data, the interface on the storage devices are typically powered up for access on demand. For example, in hard drives, although the data is stored in a non- volatile magnetic state, the disk is typically kept spinning at constant RPM, which requires considerable power. This is in addition to the solid-state electronics that maintain communications with the rest of the computer system, such as the Serial ATA interface commonly found in computers. A common emerging technique for energy-aware and energy proportional data storage is that of consolidation, namely, that data should be aggregated to fewer storage nodesH. Amur, J. Cipar, V. Gupta, G. R. Ganger, M. A. Kozuch, and K. Schwan, \\"Robust and flexible power-proportional storage,\\" in Proceedings of the 1st ACM symposium on Cloud computing - SoCC ‚Äô10.

USENIX Association, Feb. 2010, p. 20. [Online]. Available: http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1855511.1855531 when throughput demands are low. However, this is not a trivial task, and it does not solve the fundamental issue of energy disproportionality within a single server. For this, hardware design innovations are needed at the individual storage unit level. Even modern solid state drives (SSDs) made with flash memory have shown signs of energy disproportionality.T.

Available: https://doi.org/10.1007%2F978-3-642-20244-5 Databases are a common type of workload for datacenters, and they have unique requirements that make use of idle low-power states difficult. However, for \\"share-nothing\\" databases, some have proposed dynamic scaling of the databases as \\"wimpy nodes\\" are powered up and down on demand. Fortunately, researchers have claimed that for these share-nothing databases, the most energy efficient architecture is also the highest-performing one.D. Tsirogiannis, S. Harizopoulos, and M. A. Shah, \\"Analyzing the energy efficiency of a database server,\\" in Proceedings of the 2010 international conference on Management of data - SIGMOD ‚Äô10. New York, New York, USA: ACM Press, Jun. 2010, p. 231. [Online]. Available: http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1807167.1807194 However, this approach does not address the fundamental need for energy proportionality at the individual component level, but approximates energy proportionality at the aggregate level. =Datacenter infrastructure: Power supplies and cooling= Power supplies are a critical component of a computer, and historically have been very power inefficient. However, modern server-level power supplies are achieving over 80% power efficiency across a wide range of loads, although they tend to be least efficient at low utilizations. Nevertheless, as workloads in datacenters tend to utilize servers in the low to medium range, this region of the operation is inefficient for the server power supplies and datacenter-scale uninterruptible power supplies (UPSes).S. Greenberg, E. Mills, and B. Schudi, \\"Best Practices for Data Centers: Lessons Learned From Benchmarking 22 Data Centers,\\" Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Tech. Rep., 2006. Innovations are needed to make these supplies much more efficient at the typical region of operation. Like power supplies, datacenter and server-level cooling tends to be most efficient at high loads. Coordinating server power management of the traditional components along with active cooling is critical to improving overall efficiency.N. Tolia, Z. Wang, M. Marwah, C. Bash, P. Ranganathan, and X. Zhu, \\"Delivering Energy Proportionality with Non Energy-Proportional Systems ‚Äì Optimizing the Ensemble,\\" 2008. [Online]. Available: https://www.usenix.org/legacy/event/hotpower08/tech/full_papers/tolia/tolia_html/ =System and datacenter-level= Perhaps the most efforts in energy proportionality have been targeted at the system, cluster, and datacenter scale. This is because improvements in aggregate energy proportionality can be accomplished largely with software reorganization, requiring minimal changes to the underlying hardware. However, this relies on the assumption that a workload can scale up and down across multiple nodes dynamically based on aggregate demand. Many workloads cannot achieve this easily due to the way data may be distributed across individual nodes, or the need for data sharing and communication among many nodes even to serve a single request. Note that aggregate energy proportionality can be achieved with this scheme even if individual nodes are not energy proportionalX. Zheng and Y. Cai, \\"Achieving Energy Proportionality in Server Clusters,\\" International Journal of Computer Networks (IJCN), vol. 1, no. 2, pp. 21‚Äì35, 2010. Various application, middleware, OS, and other types of software load balancing approaches have been proposed to enable aggregate energy proportionality. For instance, if individual workloads are contained entirely within virtual machines (VMs), then the VMs can be migrated over the network to other nodes at runtime as consolidation and load balancing are performed. However, this can incur significant delay and energy costs, so the frequency of VM migration cannot be too high. Researchers have proposed improving the low power idle states of servers, and the wake-up/shutdown latencies between active and idle modes, because this is an easier optimization goal than active performance scaling. If servers could wake up and shutdown at a very fine time granularity, then the server would become energy proportional, even if active power is constant at all utilizations. Others have proposed hybrid datacenters, such as KnightShift,D. Wong and M. Annavaram, \\"KnightShift: Scaling the Energy Proportionality Wall through Server-Level Heterogeneity,\\" in 2012 45th Annual IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture. IEEE, Dec. 2012, pp. 119‚Äì130. [Online]. Available: http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6493613 such that workloads are migrated dynamically between high-performance hardware and low-power hardware based on the utilization. However, there are many hardware and software technical challenges to this approach. These can include the hardware and software support for heterogeneous computing, shared data and power infrastructure, and more. A study from 2011 argues that energy proportional hardware is better at mitigating the energy inefficiences of software bloat, a prevalent phenomenon in computing.S. Bhattacharya, K. Rajamani, K. Gopinath, and M. Gupta, \\"The interplay of software bloat, hardware energy proportionality and system bottlenecks,\\" in Proceedings of the 4th Workshop on Power-Aware Computing and Systems - HotPower ‚Äô11. New York, New York, USA: ACM Press, Oct. 2011, pp. 1‚Äì5. [Online]. Available: http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2039252.2039253 This is because the particular hardware components that bottlenecks overall application performance depends on the application characteristics, i.e., which parts are bloated. If non-bottlenecked components are very energy disproportional, then the overall impact of software bloat can make the system less efficient. For this reason, energy proportionality can important across a wide range of hardware and software applications, not just in datacenter settings.

It is the feature-length version of BAFTA nominated short, Emotional Fusebox, which premiered at the London Film Festival in 2014. The story of a 29-year-old, Anna (portrayed by Jodie Whittaker) has moved into her mum's shed and is refusing to move out after the death of her twin brother. The film premiered at the 2016 Tribeca Film Festival in April 2016, winning one of the top awards - the Nora Ephron prize for best female director. Plot Anna is stuck: she's approaching 30, living like a hermit in her mum's garden shed and wondering why the suffragettes ever bothered. She spends her days making videos using her thumbs as actors - thumbs that bicker about things like whether Yogi Bear is a moral or existential nihilist. But Anna doesn't show these videos to anyone and no one knows what they are for. A week before her birthday her Mum serves her an ultimatum - she needs to move out of the shed, get a haircut that doesn't put her gender in question and stop dressing like a homeless teenager. Naturally, Anna tells her Mum to \\"back the f-off\\". However, when her school friend comes to visit, Anna's self- imposed isolation becomes impossible to maintain. Soon she is entangled with a troubled eight year old boy obsessed with Westerns, and the local real estate agent whose awkward interpersonal skills continually undermine his attempts to seduce her.

This alkynylation reaction is enantioselective and involves an alkynylzinc reagent rather than the sodium acetylide used by John Ulric Nef in his 1899 report of the synthetic approach. Propargyl alcohols are versatile precursors for the chirally-selective synthesis of natural products and pharmaceutical agents, making this asymmetric addition reaction of alkynylzinc compounds useful. For example, Erick Carreira used this approach in a total synthesis of the marine natural product leucascandrolide A, a bioactive metabolite of the calcareous sponge Leucascandra caveolata with cytotoxic and antifungal properties isolated in 1996 (an earlier partial synthesis was reported by Crimmins and a total synthesis was reported by James Leighton). Examples of ligands used in asymmetric addition of alkynylzinc compounds to aldehydes. Various chiral ligands have been studied for use in this reaction. The acidity of the terminal alkynyl proton allows the alkynylzinc compound to be generated in situ from the appropriate alkyne with an alkylzinc reagent or zinc triflate, Zn(OTf)2. The first example of catalytic asymmetric addition of alkynylzinc compounds to aldehydes was reported by Kenso Soai and co-workers in 1990. In their experiments, chiral amino alcohols (A and B in the figure) and amines (such as C) were used as ligands, and the alkynylzinc reagent was prepared from reaction of alkyne with diethylzinc. Yields were high but the resulting enantiomeric excesses were poor, the greatest achieved being only 34% with 5 mol% ligand loading. Carreira and co-workers achieved significantly higher enantiomeric excesses (up to 99%) using stoichiometric amounts of the (1S, 2R)-enantiomer of N-methylephedrine (D) at room temperature with a broad range of aldehydes, and generating the alkynylzinc compound using Zn(OTf)2.

The programme, which was founded in 2007, is presented in partnership with Renault and was created to promote the dissemination of work by film-makers from all over the world who are shaping the cinema of the future, to introduce them to the world of European cultural creation, and to forge closer ties between filmmakers by strengthening co-operation between their national cinema academies. The programme comprises three different aspects: The Panorama, The Tour and The Gala Dinner. The Panorama The Panorama comprises a selection by the Acad√©mie des Arts et Techniques du Cin√©ma of the best short films from around the world. The selection is based on short films that received awards from their countries' national cinema academies during the previous year (e.g. Oscar, C√©sar, Goya, BAFTA, etc.). Representing a literal panorama of cinematographic creations from around the world, the films from this programme are presented in various European capital cities by the Acad√©mie des C√©sar and the respective national cinema academies. Screenings are either held all on the same night or over successive evenings. They are open to the public, free of charge. The Tour This is a tour organized by the Acad√©mie des C√©sar for the film-makers selected for the Panorama lasting several days and taking in various European capitals where the Panorama screenings are scheduled to take place, giving them the opportunity to attend the public screenings of their films and to meet local film industry professionals. The Tour involves visits to places of historical and cultural significance in each country as well as an introduction to the national cinema academies and industry professionals of those countries and their film funding schemes. Part of the purpose of the Tour is to enable the film-makers to meet potential producers and investors of their first and second feature films. Past cities of the Tour include Brussels, Luxembourg, Madrid, Stockholm, Montreal, Lisbon, Athens, Rome, Vienna and Paris. The Gala Dinner The Gala Dinner is held at the headquarters of UNESCO in Paris, the World Heritage Centre, in honour of the film-makers selected to participate in the Panorama. At the event, the film- makers are partnered with leading industry professionals and awarded with golden medallions printed by Monnaie de Paris.

A Complete Guide to Hoysala Temples. Abhinav, 1996. pp. 83‚Äì85. The temple is built on a jagati (platform) and the building material used is Soapstone (green‚Äìchloritic schist). It has a large \\"linga\\" (the universal symbol of the god Shiva) in its sanctum and an equally large and extremely well carved Nandi in a closed hall with walls that have perforated stone windows. The temple also has an unique life-size standing image of the goddess Parvati (consort of Shiva). The images of the navagraha (lit, \\"nine planets\\") facing each other is another unique feature. There are two images of the god Ganesha (son of Shiva), one outside the sanctum and the other at the entrance to the sanctum housing the goddess Parvati. In the common hall are the intricately carved independent images (not in frieze) of deities from the Hindu pantheon that are noteworthy: Chamundeshwari (the divine mother), Kartikeya (another son of Shiva), Ganesha, Kala Bhairava (a ferocious form of Shiva), a set of images depicting the different incarnations (avatars) of Parvati, and Surya Narayana (the Sun god).

The present church, built in the early English style, dates from the mid-13th century. Renovations in the late 19th century included the complete rebuilding of the chancel, the addition of a north aisle and the renovation of the nave and south aisle. The 15th-century three-stage west tower is high and houses a set of eight bells and a carillon. The first building on the site was probably a Norman Oratory built c.1130 and demolished in c.1250. Remnants of the oratory have been incorporated into the south porch. History The original Norman Church was small and occupied the site of the present nave. The oratory was demolished c.1250 and replaced by a church with tower, nave, south aisle and chancel built in the Early English style. Additions and alterations were made to the church in 1366. In the 14th century Walter le Deneis (the Danish Man) founded a Chantry Chapel at Trewyn, about north of the Church. He endowed the priests of the chantry for two hundred years. The Deneis, or Dennis, family held the manors of Pancrasweek, Manworthy and Trewyn. The principal duty of a chantry priest was to say Mass daily for the souls of the founder family. The chantry was incorporated into the church in c.1450, probably in the South Aisle. The last appointment of a chantry priest was in 1524. in 1881‚Äì82 the chancel ( long by wide) was completely rebuilt. In 1883 the nave, south aisle and porch were rebuilt and the north aisle, organ chamber and vestry were added. With the exception of the porch doorway, all the rebuilding was in the Early English style, the style which the original building showed most signs. Local stone was used for the main walls and Hatherleigh stone was used for the buttresses, quoins, dressings, copings, and window tracery. Internally, the window dressings and the arches of the north aisle are of Corsham Bath stone. The roofs of the nave and aisles are of pitch pine. The architect was Otho Bathurst Peter (1854-1937), of Launceston. Chancel The floor is laid with encaustic tiles by Maw & Co. Externally it is higher than the nave. The oak wagon roof is panelled, with corbels carved with angels. Eighteen carved oak angels are mounted on stone brackets below the wall-plate. The chancel is lit by four windows all c.1883. On the east wall the five-light window depicts the Ascension. On the north wall there are two two-light windows; one depicts the parable of the Good Samaritan and the other St Peter and St Paul. The lancet window on the south wall is of the Virgin Mary. This window was the gift of clergy of the Deanery and is by Mr Drake of Exeter. The other three windows are by Lavers and Westlake of London. The chancel is divided from the organ chamber by a pointed arch on carved stone corbels. A similar arch divides the organ chamber from the south aisle. The oak reredos, c.1926, was carved in 15th-century style by Herbert Read of Exeter. It was the gift of the children of Mrs Mary Elizabeth Aspinall, late of Waterloo House, Holsworthy, and is dedicated to her memory. The Reredos depicts St Peter and figures with shields that carry eight symbols of the Passion Story. They are 1. Hammer and Pliers; 2. Wounds of the heart, hands and feet; 3. Cloak and Dice; 4. Ladder sponge and spear; 5. Nails and crown of thorns; 6. Pillar and two scourges; 7. Bag of tribute money; and 8. Sword and Malchus's ear. It was painted and gilded in 1968. Nave and aisles In the mid-20 century the north aisle was transformed into a Lady Chapel. The three- light window, c.1970, above the altar on the east wall, depicts the enthroned Virgin. The three-light litany window, c.1883, on the west wall has stained glass by Clayton and Bell of London. The aisle is also lit by three three- light windows, c.1883, on the north wall. The south aisle, long by wide, is lit by two three-light windows installed in 1883 and by a three-light window, c.1867, in memory of the Cory family. The nave, long by wide, is divided from the south aisle by an arcade of four equilateral pointed arches raised on massive octagonal piers that date from the fourteenth century. In 1883 the arches were raised by two feet. The nave is divided from the north aisle by a similar arcade of four arches, built in 1883. A glass partition, erected in 1973, separates the nave from the tower entrance. Remains of the rubble walls of the Norman Oratory are visible near the tower. The carved oak pulpit was dedicated in June 1910 and was donated by Mrs Boutcher and Miss Ethel Mary Aspinall in memory of their brother, John Aspinall (1883‚Äì1904). The carving was by Miss Aspinall. Porch The porch has a pointed arch opening, with rosettes to reveals, and a decorative ogee arch surround with blind niches. On the east wall there is a carved stone Holy water stoup. On the west wall there is a Norman capital of a colonnette above which is a carved stone panel depicting the Agnus Dei thought to be the centre of a tympanum. Two Norman colonnettes, with Romanesque capitals are incorporated into the wall on each side of the doorway. The doorway has a Norman style arch with zig-zag decoration that was added in 1883. Tower The mid-15th century, three stage crenellated west tower is constructed of local stone and has four Crocketed Pinnacles. The granite setback buttresses are terminated by crockets. The west door of the tower is a Four-centred arch with hoodmould and label stops. The tower is high. A spiral granite stairway provides access to the upper three levels of the tower. From the ringing floor the steps ascend to the clock room. A clock was first mentioned in the Churchwarden's accounts of 1690. The present clock was installed in 1869 and is by Gillet and Bland Steam Clock Factory, Croydon. A mechanism to chime the Westminster quarters was added in 1873. The clock used to be wound daily by hand by three separate movements; one each for the hours, minutes and the chimes. It is now electrically wound. The Clock room also houses the electronic equipment of the Carillon. From the Clock room the steps lead to the Belfry. In 1553 there were three bells and in 1727 there were five. in 1826 eight new bells, cast by Thomas Mears of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry, were installed. Their size ranged from to . In 1949 the bells were recast with increased weight. The inscriptions from the old bells was cast onto the new ones and all the bells have 'Gillette & Johnson Croydon 1949' inscribed on their top band. The bells were re-hung onto a new steel framework. At the same time a new Carillon, also by Gillette & Johnson, was installed. The whole work was re-dedicated by Robert Mortimer (Bishop of Exeter). Bell 5 'Given by the family of the late Rector, Owen Lewis Meyrick, consisting of two sons and four daughters, 1826.' Bell 6 'The expense incurred by placing a set of eight Bells in this tower was defrayed by a Subscription, which was raised through the persevering exertions of Francis Thorne, and his Nephew Francis Thorne Honey, 1826.' Bell 7 'E Dono Humphredi F. Davie, Baronetti, A.D. MDCCCXXVI.' Bell 8 'The gift of Philip Henry Earl of Stanhope, 1826.' From the Belfry, the steps climb to a doorway about high that gives access to the roof. Organ The organ is said to be by Renatus Harris and to have come from Chelsea Old Church (also known as All Saints). It was removed to Bideford in 1723 and brought to Holsworthy in 1865. Over the next two years it was restored and enlarged by the organ builders Geek and Sons of Launceston, Cornwall. The organ was rededicated on 20 June 1867. On 27 June 1867 the organ was opened by Mr W B Gilbert of London whom the Western Times described as \\"one of the best organists of the day\\". In 1883‚Äì84, during the church renovation, the organ was renovated by Hale and company, of Plymouth. In 1926 it was overhauled and reduced in size.

It has a Roud Folk Song Index number of 649. History The song may date to the Elizabethan or Jacobean era, and versions have been found in Great Britain, Denmark, and France. Its origin is sometimes given as Thomas Heywood's play The Rape of Lucrece, published 1608 and first performed around 1630. This opinion was held by, and may originate with, John Masefield who wrote, \\"The words of the solo are scarcely fitted for quotation, but those who wish to know what they are like may consult Thomas Heywood's play of 'Valentinian', where a song almost identical, is given at length.\\" ‚Äî noting in a later article that Valentinian was a mistake and Lucrece was meant. The song referenced by Masefield is probably the one beginning \\"Did he take fair Lucrece by the toe man? ‚ÄîToe man. ‚ÄîI man. ‚ÄîHa, ha, ha, ha man.\\" However, the relationship between Heywood's song and \\"The Maid of Amsterdam\\" is contested by some experts, including Stan Hugill. The author of the notes for Sharp Sea Shanties writes, \\"It too has an amorous encounter with anatomical progression but there, to put it simply, all similarity ends. The presence of a common entertaining theme line does not prove a connection except possibly in the idea itself.\\" The tune and lyrics of a version entitled \\"Lee-gangway Chorus (a-roving)\\" but opening with the familiar \\"In Amsterdam there dwelt a maid\\" was included in Naval Songs (1883) by William A Pond. Between 1904 and 1914, the famous English folklorist Cecil Sharp collected many different versions in the coastal areas of Somerset, England, perhaps suggesting that the song was particularly popular there. Lyrics The lyrics have many variations. They are often cautionary tales of a sailor's amorous encounter with the Amsterdam maid, who, variably, is married, taking advantage of the sailor for his money, or has the pox. The notes for the Doug Bailey-produced album Short Sharp Shanties claim the most traditional lyrics describe the sailor progressively touching different parts of the maid's body. Regardless of varying lyrics, almost all versions contain the chorus of: Recordings = Traditional Recordings = Folk song collector James Madison Carpenter recorded several versions in the early 1930s, mainly in Scotland and presumably from seamen. Stanley Slade of Bristol, England, known as 'The Last Shantyman', sang a version to folklorist Peter Kennedy in 1943, and the recording is available online via the Vaughan Williams Memorial Library. Kennedy also recorded fishermen at Cadgwith, Cornwall, England, singing a version. Both versions can be heard on the British Library Sound Archive website. Alan Lomax recorded two versions of the song in the United States, one from Charles J Finger of Washington D.C. in 1937, and another from Captain Richard Maitland in Sailor's Snug Harbor retirement home in Staten Island, New York in 1939. Helen Creighton recorded two versions in Nova Scotia, Canada in the 1940s. = Popular Recordings = The song has been recorded by various artists, such as operatic baritone Leonard Warren, the Robert Shaw Chorale and Paul Clayton. It was featured on the ending credits of episode two of the 1950s television show The Buccaneers and also as background music on various episodes. It is the 2nd track of the soundtrack of the video game Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag, and the song can be heard when the main character is riding the ship.

Life and career Newton was born in Burlington County, New Jersey, on March 31, 1800, to Isaac arms in Delaware County, Pennsylvania. His entrepreneurial spirit led him to also open a cream of ice and confectionery store in Philadelphia as a source of extra income. Around 1854, Newton bought 1000 acres of farmland in Virginia, which he hired overseers to run when his wife refused to live there. A series of disasters (among them the outbreak of the Civil War) sent Newton to Washington, D.C., in search of a government job. At some earlier point, he had begun selling farm products to the White House, and he had recently made the acquaintance of President Abraham Lincoln, so he was well-positioned to seek a job at a time when the war had filled Washington with place-seekers. In 1861, he became superintendent of the Agricultural Division of the United States Patent Office. The following year, when Congress established the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Newton was appointed the USDA's first commissioner. The appointment was controversial; at least one agricultural publication wrote a sarcastic and almost certainly unfair editorial headlined \\"Who is Isaac Newton?\\" alleging that he was illiterate. The more modern view is that he was \\"energetic and basically sound\\" in his ideas for the development of the brand-new department. Among other things, he was responsible for inaugurating the USDA's statistical services to collect and analyze agricultural data. He also championed a nationwide system of daily weather reports for farmers, which eventually led to establishment of the U.S. Weather Service under USDA. He even set up an experimental farm on what is now the National Mall quite near the Capitol‚Äîin fact, right where today's USDA headquarters stand. Newton arranged for the USDA to issue monthly and annual agricultural reports. These were very popular with farmers and circulated widely. However, they also represented a potential threat to established agricultural journals, so it is not surprising that many of the editors of these journals repeatedly called for Newton to step down. Newton did not help his own cause by vigorously abusing his most vocal critics and by indulging in nepotism. For example, he appointed a son to take charge of his experimental farm, and he twice appointed a nephew to be chief clerk of the USDA. (His paternal granddaughter, Amanda Newton, also worked for the USDA, but she was hired many years after his death.) Despite everything, he retained President Lincoln's support up to the president's death. In July 1866, Newton suffered a heat stroke while visiting his experimental farm, and he never fully recovered. He died a little less than a year later, on June 19, 1867.

(Here In denotes the length of the interval In.) Every countable set is a strong measure zero set, and so is every union of countably many strong measure zero sets. Every strong measure zero set has Lebesgue measure 0. The Cantor set is an example of an uncountable set of Lebesgue measure 0 which is not of strong measure zero. Borel's conjecture states that every strong measure zero set is countable. It is now known that this statement is independent of ZFC (the Zermelo‚ÄìFraenkel axioms of set theory, which is the standard axiom system assumed in mathematics). This means that Borel's conjecture can neither be proven nor disproven in ZFC (assuming ZFC is consistent). Sierpi≈Ñski proved in 1928 that the continuum hypothesis (which is now also known to be independent of ZFC) implies the existence of uncountable strong measure zero sets. In 1976 Laver used a method of forcing to construct a model of ZFC in which Borel's conjecture holds. These two results together establish the independence of Borel's conjecture. The following characterization of strong measure zero sets was proved in 1973: :A set A ‚äÜ R has strong measure zero if and only if A + M ‚â† R for every meagre set M ‚äÜ R. This result establishes a connection to the notion of strongly meagre set, defined as follows: :A set M ‚äÜ R is strongly meagre if and only if A + M ‚â† R for every set A ‚äÜ R of Lebesgue measure zero. The dual Borel conjecture states that every strongly meagre set is countable. This statement is also independent of ZFC.

The church is part of \\"Churches Together in Ottery St Mary\\" which includes the churches of four other denominations in the town.https://www.otterystmary.org.uk/churches-together-in-ottery History The parish church of St Mary's has been referred to as \\"a miniature Exeter Cathedral\\". Like the cathedral it is cruciform in plan, with transepts formed by towers Nikolaus Pevsner describes the building as ‚Äúlying large and low like a tired beast‚Äù. It is long, and the towers are high. It was consecrated in 1260, at which time the manor and patronage of the church belonged to Rouen Cathedral, as it had from before the Norman invasion. Pevsner assumes that the tower-transepts and the outer walls of the chancel date back to 1260, and that the towers were built in imitation of those at Exeter. This Grade I listed building is one of 107 Listed sites in the area.Listed Buildings in Ottery St. Mary, East Devon, Devon The summary for the Listing provides this information: \\"Consecrated by Bishop Bronescombe in 1260. Altered and added to by Bishop Grandison circa 1330. Mainly Early English ... 2 towers above transepts .... The interior was restored drastically mid C19 by Butterfield and others\\".Church of St Mary List Entry Number 1212599 The work in the 1300s included \\"rebuilding of the nave, and addition of the Lady Chapel at the east end and two chantry chapels either side of the chancel\\" according to a reliable source. Other renovations were completed circa 1520: \\"principally expansion of the north nave aisle, complete with elaborate, fan-vaulted ceiling and pendant bosses\\".Ottery St Mary, Devon =St Mary's College= In 1335 John Grandisson, Bishop of Exeter, bought the manor and advowson from Rouen and on 22 January 1338 established a collegiate foundation with forty members. He rebuilt much of the church, and the present nave, chancel, aisles and Lady chapel date from this time. The nave is of five bays, and the chancel, unusually long in proportion, is of six, with vestry chapels to north and south. The roof The church is noted for its painted roof and early sixteenth-century fan vaulted aisle, the Dorset Aisle, designed and commissioned by Cecily Bonville, 7th Baroness Harington, whose first husband was Thomas Grey, 1st Marquess of Dorset. The church has ten misericords dating from the building of the church in 1350, five showing the arms of Bishop John de Grandisson. The church interior also has two medieval carved stone green men. Other interesting features include the tombs of Otho de Grandisson and his wife, the altar screen, sedilia, and a wooden eagle given by Bishop Grandisson. The college was dissolved on 24 December 1545 and this church began serving the parish, under the management of governors. The other buildings of the college were demolished. =Parish church= The building was closed on 21 May 1849 for a full restoration by the architect William Butterfield. His alterations included lowering the floor level of the transepts, crossing and western part of the chancel to that of the nave, making the east end, designed for the needs of the collegiate foundation, more suitable for parochial use. All of the galleries were removed, except for that in the south transept which was retained for the organ. The pews were removed and substituted with open seating. The altar area was paved with encaustic tiles. The walls were scraped of plaster and cleaned. The church reopened on 22 May 1850. The restoration was achieved by voluntary donation, including one of ¬£1,200 from Mr. Justice Coleridge. New choir stalls were dedicated in 1908. They were designed by John Duke Coleridge and paid for by Miss Mary Dickinson in memory of her father, the late Rev. Frederick Binley Dickinson. The ancient altar screen had three vacant niches filled with sculptured scenes in 1934. The sculptural work was done in Beer stone, by Herbert Read, sculptor of Exeter, funded by Mrs Winstanley in memory of her husband, Harold WInstanley. There is a small stone plaque commemorating the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge in the south churchyard wall. Ottery St Mary parish registers are held in the Devon Record Office and begin in 1601. Sir Ernest Mason Satow, scholar, diplomat and Japanologist, is buried in the churchyard, and a plaque inside the church, originally at the British Legation chapel in Peking, commemorates his life.Ian Ruxton, The Diaries of Sir Ernest Mason Satow, 1906-1911, Kyoto: Eureka Press, 2015.

List of vicars =Wardens of St Mary's college= =Vicars of the parish church= Astronomical clock The astronomical clock The south transept (bell tower) houses the Ottery St Mary astronomical clock, one of the oldest surviving mechanical clocks in the country. It is commonly attributed to Bishop John de Grandisson, who was Bishop of Exeter (1327‚Äì69) and adheres to Ptolemaic cosmology with the Earth at the centre of the solar system. The clock was restored to working condition in 1907. Organ The church has had organs since at least the 14th century, as they are mentioned in Bishop Grandisson's statues for the foundation of the collegiate church. By the time the college was dissolved in 1545, there were three organs, but whatever organs survived into the 17th century were destroyed in 1645 during the English Civil War. Around 1828, Flight and Robson provided a new organ in the west gallery. This was moved to the south tower in 1849. Hele & Co carried out work in 1878 and again in 1901.

Application of modified Wittig-Claisen tandem reactions to the total synthesis of horsfiline. Modified Wittig-Claisen tandem reaction is a cascade reaction that combines Wittig reaction and Claisen rearrangement together. The Wittig reaction generates the allyl vinyl ether intermediate that further participates in a Claisen rearrangement to generate the final Œ≥, Œ¥-unsaturated ketone or aldehyde product (Figure \\"Modified Wittig-Claisen tandem reactions\\"). The modified Wittig-Claisen tandem reaction has been a useful retrosynthetic strategy and has been applied to the synthesis of various complex natural products and other molecules. This reaction is especially useful for construction of cyclic ketones with double bond at the Œ≥, Œ¥-position. Paquette and co-workers reported the synthesis of 4-cyclooctenone structure by expanding the six-membered ring of a 2-cyclohexanone structure.Philippo, C. M. G.; Vo, N. H.; Paquette, L. A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991, 113, 2763. The key step was a tandem process that combines Tebbe olefination (a reaction similar to Wittig reaction) with Claisen rearrangement (Figure \\"Application of modified Wittig-Claisen tandem reactions for construction of 4-cyclooctenone structure\\"). Tandem Wittig-Claisen reaction has also been applied to the construction of the spiro[pyrrolidin-3,3‚Äô-oxindole] ring system in natural products such as horsfiline.Kulkarni, M. G.; Dhondge, A.

A Wittig-Claisen reaction sequence converted the starting material to a 4-pentenal derivative that could serve as a versatile intermediate for the synthesis of various natural products. In this case, the 4-pentenal derivative was further converted to the natural product horsfiline, the active ingredient of a traditional herbal medicine with analgesic effects.

Tay (1832 ‚Äì 8 January 1892) was a Seventh-day Adventist missionary who was known for his pioneering work in the South Pacific. It was through his efforts that most of the inhabitants of Pitcairn Island were converted to Adventism, and that the General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists purchased the Pitcairn schooner for missionary work in the South Pacific. Early life John I. Tay was born in 1832. He went to sea when he was sixteen. Tay served on the U.S. sloop-of-war USS Housatonic during the American Civil War (1861‚Äì65). He settled in Oakland, California after the war, and joined the Adventists in 1873. He married a woman named Hannah and built a house in Oakland. He worked to spread the Adventist message on the ships in Oakland harbor. He had been given the book Mutiny on the Bounty by his mother when he went to sea, heard more of Pitcairn Island from a shipmate on the Housatonic who had visited the island, and heard yet more from the captain of the Ocean King whom he met in Oakland harbor. All this made him want to visit the island. First visit to Pitcairn By 1886 Tay was in poor health, and was advised by his doctor to take a sea voyage. Tay sailed to Tahiti on the Tropic Bird as ship's carpenter. He left San Francisco on 1 July 1886 and reached Tahiti on 29 July 1886. After waiting less than two months, he obtained passage for Pitcairn on HMS Pelican. This was a British man-of-war. Tay reached Pitcairn Island on 18 October 1886, and stayed until the last week of November. At the time Pitcairn was inhabited by descendants of the mutineers on HMS Bounty. The islanders were already familiar with Adventist concepts, as they had received a box of Adventist tracts about ten years earlier. In five weeks Tay converted the whole population to Adventism. He was unable to perform baptisms since he was not ordained, but promised to return with a minister. Tay left the island on 20 November 1886 on the 14-ton yacht General Evans, bound for Tahiti. While waiting for a ship to carry him back to San Francisco, he wrote a letter to a friend that was used for a story by the San Francisco Chronicle. The newspaper wrote \\"[S]o successful was he [Tay], as he claims, in his efforts to convince people there [at Pitcairn] that Saturday, the seventh day of the week, is the true and divinely appointed Sabbath, that the entire community determined to observe Saturday as their Sabbath in the future.... While at Pitcairn's Island, Mr. Tay was the guest of their head man [Simon Young], who visited this city a few years ago. He was then a very strict Sunday Sabbatarian.\\" Later missionary activity Elder and Mrs. Edward Gates (left), Elder and Mrs. Albert Read (right), Mr. and Mrs. John Tay (standing) Based on Tay's report after his return, the General Conference of the Seventh-day Adventists sent a mission to Pitcairn. The Schooner Phoebe Chapman left Honolulu on 31 July 1888 with the Adventist pastor E.J. Cudney on board. The plan was to stop at Tahiti to pick up John I. Tay, then continue to Pitcairn Island where Cudney could perform the promised baptisms. However, the Phoebe Chapman was lost at sea without trace, and John Tay returned from Tahiti to the US. The General Conference eventually paid for a ship to be built for missionary expeditions in the South Pacific. After a fund raising campaign, the schooner Pitcairn was purchased for US$12,000 in 1890. The Pitcairn reached Pitcairn Island on 25 November 1890 bringing Tay and his wife with the elders Gates and Read and their wives. On 26 November 1890 the British ship Troop, traveling from Oregon to Cardiff, spoke to the Pitcairn and was then boarded by Tay and about 20 islanders, who sold the captain fruit and vegetables. On 28 November 1890 the iron sailing ship Renee Rickmers of Bremerhaven was approaching Pitcairn Island when she saw the schooner, mistook it for a pirate, and rapidly stood out to sea to escape. During the schooner's three-week stay, 82 Pitcairn islanders were baptized. After this the Pitcairn sailed onward to other Pacific Islands. It carried three Pitcairn islanders as missionary helpers: James Russell McCoy, his sister Mary McCoy and Heywood Christian. Tay arrived in Fiji with a cargo of \\"literature, beans and dried fruit.\\" He was the first Seventh-day Adventist missionary to work on Fiji. The Pitcairn left him at Suva, Fiji, on 21 September 1891 and sailed for Norfolk Island. Tay died at Suva of influenza on 8 January 1892.

Clark (1847‚Äì1931) was a pioneer railway builder of Southern California and a leader in the civic, philanthropic and social activities of Los Angeles. Early life Eli P. Clark was born on November 25, 1847 near Iowa City, Iowa. His father, Timothy B. Clark, was a prosperous farmer at the time of his birth. His mother was Elvira E. Calkins. Clark attended the public schools of his district and of Grinnell, Iowa, and later attended Iowa College, also in that city. When he was 18 years of age, he passed the teachers' examination. Career Clark was a schoolteacher in Iowa for two years. At the end of that time, when he was 20 years of age, the family removed to southern Missouri, where they located on a large farm. There, Clark was associated with his father in the management and working of the farm during the summer months, and in the winter taught school in the neighborhood of his home. Clark crossed the plains to Prescott, Arizona in 1875, the trip requiring three months. There he met Gen. M. H. Sherman, who afterwards became his brother-in-law. In 1877, Clark was appointed auditor of the Arizona Territory, in which position he served for five terms, or ten consecutive years. While in this capacity, he had the attention of Gen. John C. Fr√©mont, then the 5th Territorial Governor of Arizona, and a friendship sprang up between them that ended only with Fr√©mont's death. In 1878, in partnership with A. D. Adams, Clark engaged in the lumber business, operating under the name of Clark & Adams, and also for one year he filled an appointment as assistant postmaster. In Prescott, where he continued to make his home, Clark became interested in the railway business, then of vital import in the territory, and aided materially in securing the passage of a bill by the legislature granting a subsidy of $4,000 a mile for a railroad to be built from Prescott to connect with the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad at Seligman, Arizona. Clark immediately evidenced his further interest in the undertaking by becoming one of the organizers of the new company, of which he was elected secretary and treasurer. In 1891, Clark came to Los Angeles to be associated with his brother-in-law, General Sherman, in the construction and operation of electric railways in the city and surrounding country. The Los Angeles Consolidated Railroad Company (LACE) was formed, with General Sherman as president, and Clark as vice-president and general manager. The first lines were constructed and electrified by July, 1891 and subsequent growth was rapid. A rival cable operation was acquired in 1892. All local lines were consolidated by 1894 and the system linked many areas in the downtown area, with a total of 108 route miles. By 1895, with the Los Angeles area affected by the Panic of 1893 and the resulting depression, and with the railway‚Äôs finances in dire condition, Clark and Sherman lost control of the Los Angeles Consolidated Electric Railway. The bondholders placed the blame for the line‚Äôs troubles on Clark and Sherman, and assumed control of the operation. On March 19, 1895 they renamed the system the Los Angeles Railway. It and other properties would eventually be purchased by Henry E. Huntington in September, 1898 and would ultimately become Los Angeles‚Äô illustrious Yellow Car system. Clark, reaching out for new interests, acquired local horse-car lines in Pasadena, and was interested in the construction of the Pasadena and Los Angeles Interurban Line, which was in operation in 1895. This line is noteworthy as it was the first interurban line in Southern California. The growth of the beach district also gave great opportunities for successful enterprises, and another line, the Pasadena and Pacific Railway, between Los Angeles and Santa Monica, was opened for traffic April 1, 1896. This line became the nucleus of a new railway system, the Los Angeles Pacific Railway, incorporated in June, 1898, which covered much of the west side of Los Angeles area through Hollywood and what would become Beverly Hills, Westwood, Santa Monica, Venice and Culver City, and which included a line from Santa Monica down the coast to Redondo Beach. Clark was largely instrumental in the organization of this company, along with brother-in-law Sherman, and was president and general manager. Though Sherman and Clark had managed to salvage the earlier Los Angeles and Pasadena Electric line when they lost control of the Los Angeles Consolidated Electric Railway, they lost control of that line in January, 1898 and Henry Huntington eventually acquired it. This line was the earliest ancestor of Huntington‚Äôs great Pacific Electric Railway. In 1906, Sherman and Clark sold a controlling interest in their LAP system to E.H. Harriman‚Äôs Southern Pacific Railroad for a reported six million dollars. They sold their remaining interest to the Southern Pacific in late 1909, and the Los Angeles Pacific Railway, along with six other electric railways, was merged into the great Pacific Electric system in 1911 in what was known as ‚ÄúThe Great Merger‚Äù. Most of what was the Los Angeles Pacific Railway became the Western District of the Pacific Electric. The opportunities offered in the northern country appealed to Clark, and in 1906, he organized and became president of the Mount Hood Railway and Power Company, at Portland, Oregon. The project was put on a successful operating basis, and later Clark sold his interest therein to the Portland Railway, Light and Power Company of Portland. From the time that he first came to California, Clark was interested in the development of the resources of the state and he invested heavily in real estate. In 1903 Sherman and Clark purchased the site of the present Subway Terminal Building. By the fall of 1905, realizing that a more efficient means of transporting people to the popular beach areas would someday be necessary, they acquired the right of way for a projected subway and purchased property from Hill Street to the Vineyard powerhouse near present-day Venice and La Brea Boulevards. Clark was later vice-president of the Subway Terminal Corporation, which in 1926 completed the Subway Terminal Building over the terminus of the Pacific Electric Railway‚Äôs Hollywood subway. In 1913, Clark erected the Hotel Clark across the street from the proposed terminal site, a fireproof, eleven-story structure which at the time was considered the largest reinforced concrete hotel on the west coast. Clark and Sherman participated in many real estate ventures in conjunction with the development of their rail lines. These included major investments at Sherman (West Hollywood), Hollywood, Playa del Rey, Hermosa Beach and Shakespeare Beach, just north of Hermosa. In addition, the two purchased 640 acres of land in Beachwood Canyon which Sherman and Harry Chandler would develop into Hollywoodland in 1923. After he severed his railway connections in 1909, Clark devoted his time to private investments which included the Eli P. Clark Company, the Clark and Sherman Land Company, the Del Rey Company, the Main Street Company, the Capitol Crude Oil Company, the Empire Oil Company, and the Sinaloa Land Company. He co-founded the Better America Federation, and was a member of the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce, the Los Angeles Board of Trade, and the Los Angeles Realty Board. Philanthropy Clark served on the Board of Trustees of Pomona College. Additionally, he made charitable contributions to the Young Men's Christian Association of Los Angeles. Personal life Clark married Miss Lucy H. Sherman, the sister of Moses Sherman, on April 8, 1880, in Prescott, Arizona. They had four children, three daughters and a son. Clark attended the First Congregational Church. He was a member of the California Club, the Los Angeles Country Club, the University Club and the Los Angeles Athletic Club.

Champion quince (Cydonia oblonga); watercolor by Amanda Newton, 1909. Amanda Almira Newton (c. 1860‚Äì1943) was a botanical illustrator for the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) who specialized in watercolors of fruit. Her work is now preserved in the USDA's Pomological Watercolor Collection, and she is the second-most prolific contributor to that archive of 7600 paintings, with her work representing roughly one-sixth of the total. Early life and education Amanda Almira Newton was born around 1860. She was the granddaughter of Isaac Newton, the first commissioner of the USDA, who died when she was a child; later in life, her colleague at the USDA, Royal Charles Steadman, would paint a portrait of her grandfather for her. Career Newton worked for the USDA from 1896 to 1928. This was a time when the major fruit-producing regions in the United States were just beginning to emerge, as farmers worked with the USDA to establish orchards for expanding markets. Photography was not yet in widespread use as a documentary medium, so the government relied on artists like Newton to produce technically accurate drawings for its publications. Newton was one of more than 50 skilled botanical illustrators hired in this early period‚Äîamong whom were Elsie Lower, Ellen Isham Schutt, Royal Charles Steadman, and Deborah Griscom Passmore‚Äîand she was one of the most productive, turning out more than 1200 finished watercolors for the USDA. Newton's artwork for the USDA covered a wide range of fruit and nuts, principally apples, of which there are many hundreds of examples. There are also paintings of strawberries, plums, citrus, persimmons, avocados, and cherries, as well as fruits that are still not commonly grown in the continental United States such as loquat and baobab. Most of her watercolors show a whole and a half fruit in full color; a few (such as the strawberry and cherry paintings) show foliage as well. Her style is precise and detailed, combining vigorous lines with subtle color modulations. Newton signed her work 'A.A. Newton'. In addition, beginning in 1896, Newton made wax models of some 300 specimens of fruits being grown or tested in the United States. She inaugurated production of these wax models for the USDA and later showed some of them at the Tennessee Centennial Exposition and the 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition. For the latter exposition, she created some models showing how environmental conditions, cultivation practices, and storage conditions affect the fruit's condition and keeping qualities. Newton's original paintings are now in the USDA National Agricultural Library's Pomological Watercolor Collection.

Retrieved 2014-1-24. = Early products and development = One of the company‚Äôs early planar headphones was a model called the HE5. To avoid the high cost of tooling and because quantities were small in those days, it was decided to make HE5‚Äôs ear cups out of wood. Wood was also considered a sign of quality and would help establish HiFiMAN HE5 as a higher-end headphone. Response from the market to the HE5 was wildly enthusiastic both in consumer demand and critical acclaim. HiFiMAN found themselves having to quickly ramp up production, however its ‚ÄúDIY‚Äù nature made that costly and difficult. To make matters worse, the wood ear cups began cracking when subjected to temperature and humidity extremes. HE5 was replaced by the HE5LE where the wood ear cup was replaced by plastic. This design proved to be successful and was an early forerunner of HiFiMAN planar phones to come. As a key part of the chain, the low sensitivity of planar magnetic headphones (HiFiMAN included) demanded high powered amplifiers. Since few amps like this were on the market at the time, this made it challenging for some listeners to fully realize the potential of HiFiMAN HE headphones. As a result, this spawned the company‚Äôs efforts into making higher performance amplifiers such as the EF5 and ultimately the robust HE6. Products HiFiMAN designs and manufactures high- end headphones and portable audio products like the HE-5, HE-5LE, HE-6, HE-500, HE-400 and a range of earphone's or IEM's ( In Ear Monitors) such as the revelatory RE-0, to the RE-252 and to the latest RE2000. In 2009, HiFiMAN released the HM-801, marketed as the first true high-end portable music player and have continued with the slimline Supermini and the more chunky HM series running up to the top end HM901S. HiFiMAN has been one of the foremost companies in attempting to normalise the availability and use of a 3.5mm Balanced output on their players and use for ear and headphones too. The HIFIMAN HM-601 DAP (Digital Audio Player) HiFiMAN is still best known for their planar magnetic headphones that feature advanced driver technology but the company designs and manufactures in-ear drivers, which have also garnered a variety of awards.\\"HiFiMAN HE-400 Headphone\\" Technology Integrator.

A. Keersmaekers, Geschiedenis van de Antwerpse Rederijkerskamers in de jaren 1585‚Äì1635 (Aalst, 1952) In 1660 it merged with its former rival the Violieren (which was more closely associated with artists and intellectuals), and in 1762 the society was dissolved altogether. History The chamber took part in the landjuweel (a rhetoric competition for the whole Duchy of Brabant) at Mechelen in 1515, at Diest in 1521, at Brussels in 1532, at Mechelen in 1535, at Diest in 1541, and the final such competition, at Antwerp in 1561. The chamber also provided public entertainment at such events as the triumphal entry into Antwerp of Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma. During the 1590s there were no regular public performances, and for much of the decade meetings were prohibited by decree, but after 1600 members and sympathisers of the guild again began to meet weekly for dramatic and rhetorical exercises. During the Twelve Years' Truce, representatives of De Olijftak attended a rhetoric competition hosted in Amsterdam on 7 July 1613 by the Amsterdam chamber Wit Lavendel (White lavender), and another hosted in Haarlem by the Wyngaertranken (the Vines) on 18 August 1613. The organisation was overhauled in 1615. In 1618 De Olijftak hosted a blazoenfeest in Antwerp: a rhetoric competition in which chambers entered \\"blazons\\", or painted and decorated verse rebuses carried in procession, with prizes for best rhyme, best delivery, best painting, best decoration, best procession, and so on. In 1619 the chamber was deeply in debt, having overspent on banquets and performances. They nevertheless took part in the blazoenfeest hosted by the Peoene (Peony) in Mechelen on 3 May 1620. Members of De Olijftak carried off second prize for best rhyming rebus, third prize for best painted rebus, third prize for most triumphant decoration, first prize for best composed verse, third prize for strongest line, first and second place for best recitation, first prize for best song, and second prize for most pieces entered by a single chamber.Jan Thieullier, ed., De schadt-kiste der philosophen ende poeten (Mechelen, Henry Jaye, 1621), p. LXX For the play put on for the chamber's feestdag in 1621, 400 programmes were printed. The chamber was prominent in the civic celebrations of the Habsburg victories in the Battle of White Mountain (1620), the Battle of Stadtlohn (1623) and the Siege of Breda (1625), and for the ceremonies of public mourning for the death of Albert VII, Archduke of Austria in 1621. The chamber seems to have gone into decline after 1629, and in 1646 their costumes were bought up by the rival Violieren.Anne-Laure Van Bruaene, \\"De Olijtak\\", in Repertorium van rederijkerskamers in de Zuidelijke Nederlanden en Luik 1400-1650 (digital publication, 2005). Accessed 25 Janu. 2015. It may have continued to exist as a dining club with a literary angle, rather than a drama society. In 1660, when the Violieren and the remnants of De Olijftak merged, the new chamber took the name De Olijftak, or den herstelden De Olijftak (the repaired Olive Branch). An engraving of the stage for a 1561 rhetoric competition held in Antwerp Organisation The leading officers of the chamber were the hooftman, prince, senior dean (opperdeken) and assistant dean (mededeken). The hooftman (headman) was an honorary president, a non- participating patron, who audited the chamber's accounts and mediated disputes between members. He was elected for a term of three years. The prince, who chaired the actual running of the organisation, was also elected for three years. The dean and assistant dean, who did the actual work of administering the guild, were elected for terms of two years. Other officers were the casting directors (princen van personagi√´n), the properties master (accoustrementmeester), the breuckmeesters who collected members' fees, and the busmeesters who organised collections for sick or \\"decayed\\" members. The social functions of the chamber, like those of a guild, included attending the funerals of deceased members, providing wedding presents to members who married, and providing support for sick or impoverished members. The guild employed a facteur to carry messages, collect or deliver prizes, and convey congratulations, and a knaap to do odd jobs, notify members of funerals or of extraordinary meetings, tidy the hall, and act as doorman during performances. By the 17th-century, the chamber enjoyed the services of semi-professional actors (personagi√´n) who did not pay membership fees, were provided with free food and drink at rehearsals and performances, received 6 florins for attending the funerals of guild members, and were exempt from militia duty. They worked under the direction of the princen van personagi√´n. The fee-paying members, or , enjoyed not only freedom from militia duty but the full range of social provision that the guild provided. It was also possible to pay entrance fees, rather than membership fees, as a \\"sympathiser\\" (or ), without enjoying the full rights of guild membership.

It is not disputed that the United States encouraged the government of China to provide military training and support for the Khmer Rouge and that the United States voted for the Khmer Rouge to remain the official representative of the country in the United Nations even after 1979, when the Khmer Rouge was mostly deposed by Vietnam and ruled just a small part of the country. cf. Additional alleged U.S. actions that benefited the Khmer Rouge range from tolerating Chinese and Thai aid to the organization (Henry Kissinger) to, according to Michael Haas, directly arming the Khmer Rouge. The U.S. government officially denies these claims, and Nate Thayer defended U.S. policy, arguing that little, if any, American aid actually reached the Khmer Rouge. However, it is not disputed that the U.S. voted for the Khmer Rouge, and later, for the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea (CGDK), which was dominated by the Khmer Rouge, to retain Cambodia's United Nations (UN) seat until 1982 and 1991, respectively. Background =Khmer Rouge in power= The Khmer Rouge, the communist party led by Pol Pot that ruled Cambodia after its 1975 victory in the Cambodian Civil War, perpetrated the Cambodian genocide, which between 1975 and 1979 killed between 1.5 and 2 million people, nearly 25% of Cambodia's population. During the genocide, China was the main international patron of the Khmer Rouge, supplying \\"more than 15,000 military advisers\\" and most of its external aid. =Vietnamese invasion= Vietnam invaded Cambodia in late 1978 and established the People's Republic of Kampuchea (PRK) led by Khmer Rouge defectors. Vietnam's invasion was motivated by repeated cross- border attacks by the Khmer Rouge that targeted Vietnamese civilians, including the Ba Ch√∫c massacre‚Äîin which the Khmer Rouge systematically killed the entire population of a Vietnamese village of over 3,000 people, with the exception of one woman who survived being shot in the neck and clubbed, causing her to suffer painful headaches for the rest of her life; before being killed, many of the victims were \\"barbarously tortured.\\" These attacks killed over 30,000 Vietnamese in total. Vietnam ousted the Khmer Rouge and ended the genocide in a mere 17 days, however, Vietnamese troops occupied Cambodia for the next eleven years. Following the invasion, Vietnam attempted to publicize the crimes of the Khmer Rouge, establishing an ossuary for the victims at Ba Ch√∫c and convincing the PRK to do the same for the Khmer Rouge's Cambodian victims; the Khmer Rouge's most notorious prison, S-21‚Äîwhich held 20,000 prisoners, \\"all but seven\\" of whom were killed‚Äîwas revealed in May 1979 and eventually turned into the Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum, although there were well over 150 Khmer Rouge death camps \\"on the same model, at least one per district.\\" To punish Vietnam for overthrowing the Khmer Rouge, China invaded Vietnam in February 1979, while the United States (U.S.) \\"merely slapped more sanctions on Vietnam\\" and \\"blocked loans from the International Monetary Fund [(IMF)] to Vietnam.\\" China trained Khmer Rouge soldiers on its soil during 1979‚Äî1986 (if not later), \\"stationed military advisers with Khmer Rouge troops as late as 1990,\\" and \\"supplied at least $1 billion in military aid\\" during the 1980s. After the 1991 Paris Peace Accords, Thailand continued to allow the Khmer Rouge \\"to trade and move across the Thai border to sustain their activities ... although international criticism, particularly from the U.S. and Australia ... caused it to disavow passing any direct military support.\\" =Cambodia's UN seat= As a result of Chinese and Western opposition to the Vietnamese invasion and occupation, the Khmer Rouge, rather than the PRK, was allowed to hold Cambodia's United Nations (UN) seat until 1982. After 1982, the UN seat was filled by a Khmer Rouge-dominated coalition‚Äîthe Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea (CGDK). Owing to Chinese, U.S., and Western support, the Khmer Rouge-dominated CGDK held Cambodia's UN seat until 1993, long after the Cold War had ended.  Undisputed U.S. support  The U.S. permitted Thailand to allow the Khmer Rouge to use bases in Thailand to wage a war of insurrection against the government in Phnom Penh that had been installed by Vietnam.CovertAction Quarterly, \\"On the Side of Pol Pot: U.S. Supports Khmer Rouge,\\" Issue 34, Summer 1990, p. 37, archived at Elizabeth Becker reported that U.S. National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski claimed that he \\"concocted the idea of persuading Thailand to cooperate fully with China to in efforts to rebuild the Khmer Rouge.\\"CovertAction Quarterly, \\"On the Side of Pol Pot: U.S. Supports Khmer Rouge,\\" Issue 34, Summer 1990, p. 37, archived at Covert Action Quarterly, Fall 1997, Issue 62, p. 5-6, archived at \\"The Long Secret Alliance: Uncle Sam and Pol Pot\\" The U.S. provided millions of dollars of annual food aid to 20,000-40,000 Khmer Rouge insurgents in Khmer Rouge bases in Thailand. The aid was managed by an organization that the U.S. established in the U.S. embassy in Bangkok called the Kampuchean Emergency Group (KEG) staffed by U.S. Central Intelligence Agency personnel and headed by Michael Eiland, whose job entailed interpreting satellite surveillance photos of Cambodia, and who had been operations officer of a U.S. commando reconnaissance unit code-named ‚ÄúDaniel Boone\\" and later was appointed U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency chief in charge of the Southeast Asia Region.Covert Action Quarterly, Fall 1997, Issue 62, p. 6, archived at \\"The Long Secret Alliance: Uncle Sam and Pol Pot\\" United States National Security Advisor, Zbigniew Brzezinski acknowledged that \\"I encourage[d] the Chinese to support [Khmer Rouge leader] Pol Pot ... we could never support him, but China could.\\" However, Brzezinski subsequently stated: \\"The Chinese were aiding Pol Pot, but without any help or arrangement from the United States. Moreover, we told the Chinese explicitly that in our view Pol Pot was an abomination and that the United States would have nothing to do with him‚Äîdirectly or indirectly.\\" cf. Ray Cline, a former deputy director of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency visited a Khmer Rouge camp inside Cambodia in November 1980 as a representative of the incoming administration of U.S President Ronald Reagan. The Thai Foreign Ministry denied that Cline had illegally crossed into Cambodia, but privately acknowledged that Cline had visited the Pol Pot camp. Khmer Rouge diplomatic representatives to the United Nations had publicly announced the Cline trip to the Pol Pot camp in Cambodia.CovertAction Quarterly, \\"On the Side of Pol Pot: U.S. Supports Khmer Rouge,\\" Issue 34, Summer 1990, p. 38, archived at In late 1975, former National Security Advisor and United States Secretary of State Henry Kissinger told the Thai foreign minister: \\"You should tell the Cambodians that we will be friends with them. They are murderous thugs but we won't let that stand in our way.\\"Stone, Oliver and Kuznick, Peter, \\"The Untold History of the United States\\" (New York: Simon & Schuster, Inc., 2012), p. 389 citing Ben Kiernan, \\"The Pol Pot Regime: Race, Power and Genocide under the Khmer Rouge (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 2003), xi, note 3 Years later, Kissinger elaborated: \\"The Thais and the Chinese did not want a Vietnamese-dominated Indochina. We didn't want the Vietnamese to dominate. I don't believe we did anything for Pol Pot. But I suspect we closed our eyes when some others did something for Pol Pot.\\" Event occurs from 12:12 to 12:35. Singaporean diplomat Bilahari Kausikan, recalled: \\"ASEAN wanted elections but the U.S. supported the return of a genocidal regime. Did any of you imagine that the U.S. once had in effect supported genocide?\\" In fact, Kausikan described the disagreement between the U.S. and ASEAN over the Khmer Rouge as reaching the threshold that the U.S. even threatened Singapore with \\"blood on the floor\\". Cambodian leader Norodom Sihanouk, when asked about charges of opportunism in May 1987 (\\"your critics would say ... that you would sleep with the Devil to achieve your end\\"), replied: \\"As far as devils are concerned, the U.S.A. also supports the Khmer Rouge. Even before the forming of the Coalition Government in 1982, the U.S. each year voted in favor of the Khmer Rouge regime. ... The U.S.A. says that it is against the Khmer Rouge, that it is pro-Sihanouk, pro-Son Sann. But the devils, they are there [laughs] with Sihanouk and Son Sann.\\" Allegations of U.S. military support U.S. support for the Khmer Rouge guerrillas in the 1980s was \\"pivotal\\" to keeping the organization alive, and was in part motivated by revenge over Vietnam's defeat of the U.S. during the Vietnam War, according to Tom Fawthrop. A WikiLeaks dump of 500,000 U.S. diplomatic cables from 1978 document shows that the administration of President Jimmy Carter was torn between revulsion at the atrocities of the Khmer Rouge and concern with the possibility of growing Vietnamese influence should the Khmer Rouge collapse. Prince Norodom Sihanouk, leader of a resistance group allied with the Khmer Rouge in the war against the Phnom Penh government, acknowledged that CIA advisers were present in Khmer Rouge camps in late 1989: ‚ÄúJust one month ago, I received intelligence informing me that there were U.S. advisers in the Khmer Rouge camps in Thailand, notably in Site B camp....\\"CovertAction Quarterly, \\"On the Side of Pol Pot: U.S. Supports Khmer Rouge,\\" Issue 34, Summer 1990, p. 38, archived at According to Michael Haas, despite publicly condemning the Khmer Rouge, the U.S. offered military support to the organization and was instrumental in preventing UN recognition of the Vietnam- aligned government. Haas argued that the U.S. and China responded to efforts from the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) for disarming the Khmer Rouge by ensuring the Khmer Rouge stayed armed, and that U.S. efforts for merging the Khmer Rouge with allied factions resulted in the formation of the CGDK. After 1982, the U.S. increased its annual covert aid to the Cambodian resistance from $4 million to $10 million. By contrast, Nate Thayer recounted that \\"The United States has scrupulously avoided any direct involvement in aiding the Khmer Rouge\\", instead providing non-lethal aid to non-communist Khmer People's National Liberation Front (KPNLF) and Armee Nationale Sihanouk (ANS) insurgents, which rarely cooperated with the Khmer Rouge on the battlefield, despite being coalition partners, and which fought with the Khmer Rouge dozens of times prior to 1987. According to Thayer, \\"In months spent in areas controlled by the three resistance groups and during scores of encounters with the Khmer Rouge ... I never once encountered aid given to the [non-communist resistance] in use by or in possession of the Khmer Rouge.\\" Leakage of U.S. arms to Khmer Rouge Although U.S. policy was to provide support to \\"15,000 ineffective 'noncommunist' rebel fighters\\", Joel Brinkley stated that \\"charges made the rounds that some of the American aid, $215 million so far, was finding its way to the Khmer Rouge.\\" A subsequent investigation led by Thomas Fingar of the United States Department of State's Bureau of Intelligence and Research (INR) \\"found some leakage‚Äîincluding sharing of ammunition, joint defense of a bridge, and using one truck to transport both 'noncommunist' and Khmer Rouge fighters to a fight.\\" Fingar was dismissive of his own investigators's report, which he characterized as an \\"epiphenomenon in a flea circus\\": \\"Isn't the larger objective here defeating the Vietnamese puppets in Phnom Penh?\\" See also *Bangkok Plot *Cambodia‚ÄìChina relations *Cambodia‚ÄìUnited States relations *Cambodian coup of 1970 *Cambodian genocide denial *CIA activities in Cambodia *Operation Freedom Deal *Operation Menu  References  = Citations = = Sources =  * * Also available here.  * Category:Khmer Rouge Category:United States foreign policy Category:Cambodia‚ÄìUnited States relations Category:Allegations Category:Third Indochina War ","title":"Allegations of United States support for the Khmer Rouge"},{"id":"45200908","text":"The Qufu Mosque () is a mosque in Qufu City, Shandong Province, China.http://www.islamicfinder.org/phone/getitWorld_phone.php?id=118106 See also * Islam in China * List of mosques in China References Category:Buildings and structures in Shandong ","title":"Qufu Mosque"},{"id":"45200928","text":"Allen Drury's University series is a trio of novels written by political novelist Allen Drury between 1990 and 1998, which follow a group of university fraternity brothers for a span of over 60 years from 1938 to 2001.

(1990) introduces Richard \\"Willie\\" Wilson and his diverse Alpha Zeta fraternity brothers, who are beginning their senior year at \\"the University\\" as war in Europe looms on the horizon. Into What Far Harbor? (1993) finds the remaining Alpha Zetas returning from World War II and facing a new set of challenges in a changed world. Finally in Public Men (1998), octogenarian Willie plans a 2001 reunion for his surviving pals as he looks back on his run for the Presidency decades earlier. Drury completed Public Men two weeks before his death in 1998, and the novel was published posthumously. Toward What Bright Glory? (1990) Toward What Bright Glory? is the first novel in Allen Drury's University series, published in 1990. It introduces Willie Wilson and his diverse Alpha Zeta fraternity brothers, who are beginning their senior year at \\"the University,\\" unnamed, but matching the description of his alma mater, Stanford, as war in Europe looms on the horizon. Kirkus Reviews gave this overview: =Plot summary= In 1938, student body president Willie Wilson begins his senior year at \\"the University\\" with the threat of war in Europe looming. He and his diverse Alpha Zeta fraternity brothers find themselves facing off in a microcosm of the changing world around them. Wilson tries to sponsor the fraternity's first Black member, only to be thwarted by the blatantly racist scion of a South Carolina family. The Black student blames Wilson for building his hopes up. Also, another member is hopelessly in love with Wilson's younger brother. =Critical reception= Library Journal complimented the novel as \\"bustling\\" and \\"old-fashioned\\", conceding that \\"the large cast is initially confusing, and some awkward writing doesn't help, but the storytelling soon gathers momentum, engrossing the reader in the fate of the numerous characters.\\" Publishers Weekly wrote: Kirkus Reviews called the many characters \\"tokens and stereotypes all\\", noting that \\"sweet scenes of halcyon days and noble youth coming-of-age are mixed with heavy dollops of melodrama, and the result is pure treacle\\" and calling the novel \\"painfully slow, woefully anachronistic ‚Äî though a real gem for Stanford boosters and alums.\\" Into What Far Harbor? (1993) Into What Far Harbor? is the second novel in Allen Drury's University series, published in 1993. It rejoins the remaining Alpha Zetas after World War II, Alt URL and has been called a \\"portrait of a generation struggling to find its way.\\" Promotional copy for the novel read: =Plot summary= Returning from the war, Willie Wilson and the remaining fraternity brothers of Alpha Zeta face a post-war world with new challenges, including marital and family woes, complicated sexuality, the Cold War and the Vietnam War. Public Men (1998) Public Men is the third and final novel in Allen Drury's University series, published in 1998. A 2001 reunion of the surviving Alpha Zeta fraternity brothers frames Willie Wilson's flashbacks to the decades since the events of Into What Far Harbor?. Drury completed Public Men two weeks before his death in 1998, and the novel was published posthumously. =Plot summary= Octogenarian Willie Wilson plans a 2001 reunion for his surviving pals as he looks back on the previous few decades of his life, including his run for the Presidency in the 1980s. Crossing him at every turn in these turbulent times is the villainous Ren√© Suratt. =Critical reception= Publishers Weekly called Drury's final novel \\"one last hyperbolic salvo at those he deems culpable for America's plummeting moral, cultural and political values\\" and suggested that \\"the story crumbles beneath the weight of its own world-weariness and despair for a nation that no longer measures up to the author's ideals.\\" The review also noted: Erik Tarloff wrote in The New York Times, \\"the real problem with Public Men is less its political content than its inability to hit its chosen targets.\\" He added, \\"this is a book that, fittingly enough, matches its valedictory status with a valedictory tone and atmosphere. But it isn't likely to satisfy readers who aren't already devotees of Mr. Drury's work.\\" Mary Carroll of Booklist said of the book, \\"There's nothing subtle about the politics here, but readers who enjoyed Drury's earlier University novels will want to peruse the final leg of these public men's journey to that great frat house in the sky.\\" Barbara Conaty wrote for Library Journal: Kirkus Reviews called the novel \\"a middlebrow time-passer for the Drury faithful\\" and noted, \\"Drury's a high-spirited and dreadful stylist. Still, there's some fun in his romping run-on sentences and larger-than-life cardboard figures, mouthing off paralyzing nullities as they batter straw horses.\\" The Amazon.com review stated, \\"Political junkies will appreciate the twists and turns of this Washington insider novel. Readers who require a modicum of literary polish, however, will be disappointed. Drury's talents lie in plotting his intricate tales; his writing is merely serviceable.\\" References Category:American LGBT novels Category:American political novels Category:Family saga novels Category:Novel series University Series Category:Novels with gay themes ","title":"Allen Drury's University series"},{"id":"45200955","text":"Enkelejd Pengu or Ledio PenguPengu b√´n llogarit√´: S‚Äôduhet t√´ dalim pa pik√´ - Panoramam (born 23 May 1986 in Pogradec) is an Albanian footballer who played for KS Pogradeci in the Albanian First Division.Soccerway profileFootballdatabase profile References External links * Profile - FSHF Category:1986 births Category:Living people Category:People from Pogradec Category:Association football forwards Category:Albanian footballers Category:KS Pogradeci players Category:KF Gramshi players Category:Albanian First Division players ","title":"Enkelejd Pengu"},{"id":"45201023","text":"The following television stations operate on virtual channel 51 in the United States:RabbitEars TV Query for virtual channel 51 * K05IZ-D in Hinsdale, Montana * K09ES-D in Cashmere, Washington * K09HY-D in Glasgow, Montana * K09YE-D in La Pine, Oregon * K11EZ-D in Cashmere, Washington * K14JZ-D in Peetz, Colorado * K17MJ-D in San Antonio, Texas * K24FU-D in Pleasant Valley, Colorado * K27IH-D in Holyoke, Colorado * K28JH-D in Yuma, Colorado * K29GV-D in Hagerman, Idaho * K29HD-D in Idalia, Colorado * K31IH-D in Wray, Colorado * K31IQ-D in Sterling, Colorado * K39KL-D in Akron, Colorado * K40MT-D in Bonners Ferry, Idaho * K43MH-D in Vesta, Minnesota * K45IS-D in Julesburg, Colorado * K50LP-D in Anton, Colorado * K51BA-D in Fort Peck, Montana * K51DB-D in Cortez, etc., Colorado * K51DF-D in Milton-Freewater, Oregon * K51DR-D in Wenatchee, Washington * K51IO in Bullhead City, Arizona * K51KY-D in Hermiston, Washington * KBZO-LD in Lubbock, Texas * KCBB-LD in Boise, Idaho * KFXK-TV in Longview, Texas * KFXL-LD in Lufkin, Texas * KFXL-TV in Lincoln, Nebraska * KHDS-LD in Salina, Kansas * KHFD-LD in Dallas, Texas * KHPN-LD in Warrenton, Oregon * KMSX-LD in Sacramento, California * KNSO in Merced, California * KNWA-TV in Rogers, Arkansas * KOHD in Bend, Oregon * KPPX-TV in Tolleson, Arizona * KSAW-LD in Twin Falls, Idaho * KUMO-LD in St. Louis, Missouri * KUNS-TV in Bellevue, Washington * KUSI-TV in San Diego, California * KWHS-LD in Colorado Springs, Colorado * KXAD-LD in Amarillo, Texas * KYAZ in Katy, Texas * W27DZ-D in Mayaguez, Puerto Rico * W51CW-D in Wilmington, North Carolina * WBIF in Marianna, Florida * WEIU-TV in Charleston, Illinois * WGUD- LD in Pasacagoula, Mississippi * WHSU-CD in Syracuse, New York * WIWU-CD in Marion, Indiana * WLZE-LD in Fort Myers, Florida * WNWT-LD in New York, New York * WNYA in Pittsfield, Massachusetts * WOGX in Ocala, Florida * WPXJ-TV in Batavia, New York * WPXT in Portland, Maine * WSCV in Fort Lauderdale, Florida * WSFG-LD in Berry, Alabama * WSFJ-TV in Newark, Ohio * WSSF-LD in Fayette, Alabama * WTVE in Reading, Pennsylvania * WVPT in Staunton, Virginia * WYAM-LD in Priceville, Alabama * WYJH-LD in White Lake, New York The following stations, which are no longer licensed, formerly operated on virtual channel 51 in the United States: * KBIT-LD in Chico, California * WQEH-LD in Jackson, Tennessee References 51 virtual TV stations in the United States ","title":"Channel 51 virtual TV stations in the United States"},{"id":"45201025","title":"Mali Is..."},{"id":"45201030","text":"Legality may refer to: * Principle of legality * Legality of anabolic steroids * Legality of recording by civilians * Legality of the Vietnam War * Legality of cannabis by country * Legality of drugs ** Drug regulation ** Drug legalization See also * Legality Movement Party ","title":"Legality (disambiguation)"},{"id":"45201031","text":"Erik Winquist (born January 2, 1975) is an American New Zealander visual effects supervisor.

The result of her analysis of this relation was published in a very well-received monograph, Hegel‚Äôs Critique of Kant: From Dichotomy to Identity. Sedgwick argues that Hegel criticized Kant for his ambitions to give an account of human cognition in terms of necessary and non-historical categories. She is now working on the details of Hegel's philosophy of history and its relation to his theory of knowledge and ethics. Sedgwick has been awarded various grants by the NEH, ACLS, DAAD, Fulbright, and the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation.Extracted from her CV She has been a visiting professor at University of Pennsylvania, Harvard University, University of Bonn, University of Bern, and Universit√§t Luzern.

(commonly referred to as PAS) and formally known as Prototype Automotive Services, was a specialty vehicle manufacturer which produced the 1989 Pontiac Turbo Trans Am, the 1991 GMC Syclone, the 1992 GMC Sonoma GT and the 1992 - 1993 GMC Typhoon. These were the only projects PAS created with General Motors before merging and becoming TDM Technologies in Livonia, MI and Wheel to Wheel in Troy, MI. History 1989 marked the 20th Anniversary for Pontiac's flagship ponycar, the Trans Am, and Bill Owen at Pontiac Motor Division saw to it that it was a special one. Pontiac engineers originally wanted to use an all-aluminum V-8 engine in the TTA. That plan never materialized, so the 3.8L Intercooled Buick Turbo V-6 engine from the Buick Grand National was chosen and equip with cylinder heads from the existing 3800 Series I V-6, because of their increased clearance at the strut towers and superior flow. The contract to outfit the TTA engine was given to PAS Engineering in Van Nuys, CA and the work took place in its 40,000-square-foot City of Industry facility. After the engines were completed, they were shipped back to GM, installed in the cars and then returned to PAS for testing and quality-control checks, before being offered to the public for sale. Jeff Beitzel, who was the president of PAS, had his personal 20th Anniversary TTA (one of the 5 pilots cars) sent to American Specialty Cars (ASC) and made into a convertible. PAS also made other performance changes, which included the 1LE brake package originally engineered for Trans Am racecars. The setup featured vented 12-inch front and 11.7-inch rear rotors to ensure fade-free performance. The aluminum dual- piston front and single-piston rear calipers were borrowed from the Chevrolet Corvette. Throughout the project, Scott Kelly, who was the Engineering Liaison of PAS, was instrumental in the development and production of the TTA.

College Football Jack Halfpenny, the son of Robert F. Halfpenny of Dallas, was a star football player at Dallas Sunset High School where he played well enough to be named to the 1944 Texas High School Coach's Association All-Star game. He played college football at the University of Texas where his athleticism allowed him to play an assortment of position, but always played linebacker on defense. In 1944 he played \\"blocking back\\", in front of Maxie Bell, but was better known for his play at linebacker. In 1945, starting quarterback Bobby Layne was serving in the merchant marines and Halfpenny was tapped to replace him in the first half of the season. Halfpenny, splitting time with former Rice and Southwestern player Fred Brechtel, led Texas to 5 straight victories and a #9 ranking, but lost his final game as quarterback to Rice University 7-6 on a missed extra point attempt that cost the Longhorns a perfect season. The following week, Layne returned and became the starting quarterback again and Halfpenny moved back to halfback. At the end of the season, Halfpenny received all-conference Honorable Mention recognition as a back. The Longhorns won the Southwest Conference championship and later the 1946 Cotton Bowl. In 1946 he returned to his dual role as blocking back and linebacker, though he missed a few games with injuries. Against Baylor that year, he blocked a punt late in the game that allowed Texas to seal their victory. In 1947, new coach Blair Cherry took over and installed the T-formation, which did not use a blocking back. Because he was so strong on defense, Halfpenny was too good to be benched, but in the days of platoon football had to have an offensive position. Thus, Halfpenny moved from blocking back to guard on offense. He missed the first game of the season with an injured knee, but finished his career at the 1948 Sugar Bowl. After graduation in 1948, he went to work for the Fidelity Union Life Insurance Co. in Austin. He was married to Carolyn Nunnallee in 1955, and had three children. He was later divorced and married Wilma Thompson Jones in 1968 until 1992 when Wilma Halfpenny died. In 1997 married Norma Mansfield. He died April 1, 2007 in Tyler, Texas.

In the Swayanbhuva Manvantara, Kratu was a Prajapati and a very dear son of Lord Brahma. He was also the son-in-law of Prajapati Daksha. His wife was named Santhati. It is said that he had 60,000 children. They were named as included in the Valakhilyas. Kratu also had 2 sisters, Punya and Satyavati. Saptarishi He is considered one among the seven great sages, the saptarishis believed to have originated from the mind of Brahma. As per another legend, he is believed to have been born from his father's left eye. He was married to Sannathi and the pair had sixty thousand children, called Balakhilyas, who were of the size of a thumb and resided on the bank of rivers. They were once insulted by Indra, the king of celestial deities. By the power of their penance, they were able to please Shiva, who gave him a boon that they would be able to produce a bird which would pull out nectar from Indra. The head of the sacrifice was none other than Prajapati Daksha, who was nursing a grudge against Rudra or for the simple reason that his daughter Sati married Shiva against his wishes. He did not send even an invitation to Shiva, who was his son-in-law. Sati went to the sacrifice uninvited anyway, and was terribly insulted for marrying a beggar. She was not able to listen to the insults hurled at her by her father and her sisters. She committed suicide by jumping into the sacrificial fire. Hearing the news, Lord Shiva became mad with rage. He pulled out a lock of hair from his head and threw it down, invoking the Spirit of Veerabhadra or Bhairava. He ordered Veerebhadra to go with his followers and destroy everybody who attended the Yagna, including Prajapati Daksha. Accordingly, they went and be-headed Daksha. Then they started punishing each and every god who attended the holy sacrifice. They knocked out the teeth of Pushan, took out the eyes of Bhaga, and severed the two testicles of Kratu. All the gods went to Shiva and begged for his mercy. Shiva said that they should all serve under Him as animals for some time; only then would they will regain their original status. All the gods agreed to this. Shiva then restored the teeth, eyes and testicles of the different Gods. Daksha was also revived by placing the head of a goat on his neck. After his testicles were restored, Kratu married Sannati (Santathi), the daughter of Daksha. They were all pygmy sages no bigger than the joint of the thumb. They were all chaste and pious. All were Brahmacharis and students of Vedas. (References: Maitreya Samhita 4-2-12 And Brahmanda Purana) Rishi Kratu was again born in the Vaivaswata Manvantara because of Lord Shiva‚Äôs boon. In this Manvantara he had no family. It is reported that he was born from the hand of Lord Brahma, whereas other Rishis are described as having been born from other parts of the body of Lord Brahma. (Reference ‚ÄìBhagavat). As he had no family and no children, Kratu adopted Agastya‚Äôs son, Idhvaaha. Kratu is considered as one of the Bhargavas. In Matsya Purana it is said that his mother‚Äôs name was Poulomi. He is also considered as one of the Viswa Devas.

Biography Emma Romer, born in 1813, was the daughter of John Romer and his wife, Elizabeth Cooper. The Romers were a theatrical family - \\"uncles! aunts! cousins! brothers! sisters! - all have \\"smelt the lamp\\"', as a contemporary publication puts it. She was a pupil of James Elliot, and later of Sir George Smart (according to the Dictionary of National Biography. Another source indicates she was first taught by a Mr. Watson, and then for a short period by Smart, and afterwards - Smart's fees being more than the family could afford - by Elliot). Her first theatrical appearance was announced at Covent Garden Theatre for 16 October 1830, when, as Clara in The Duenna, she exhibited a soprano voice of great volume and compass, together with considerable dramatic talent. But the faultiness of her voice-production, and failure in the technique of her art, checked her immediate progress. The suggestion is that her talent - at least in her early years - was limited by the quality of her teachers. In 1834, however, after appearing at Covent Garden as Zerlina in Fra Diavolo and Rosina in The Barber of Seville (for her benefit), Miss Romer was engaged at the English Opera House, where she created the r√¥les of Eolia in John Barnett's The Mountain Sylph and Zulima in Edward Loder's Nourjahad, under the management of Samuel James Arnold. In the winter she returned to Covent Garden, where, in 1835, as Amina in La sonnambula, she \\"reached the topmost round of the ladder of fame\\", according to the Theatrical Observer. But she immediately afterwards declined a minor part, and threw up her Covent Garden engagement. Subsequently, as Agnes in Der Freisch√ºtz and Liska in Der Vampyr (Lyceum, 1835), she won much admiration. In September 1835 she married George Almond, an army contractor. After her marriage Mrs. Almond appeared at Covent Garden as Esmeralda in Quasimodo, a pasticcio from the great masters. The death of Maria Malibran in 1836 afforded her further opportunities, and she now filled the chief r√¥les in English and Italian opera at Drury Lane, appearing in Fair Rosamond (1837), The Maid of Artois, La favorite, Robert le diable, The Bohemian Girl, Maritana, and many other pieces. In 1852 she undertook the management of the Surrey Theatre, where, during three seasons, she brought out a series of operas in English. After the death of her husband, Mrs. Almond retired from her profession, settling at Margate. She died there, aged 54, on 11 April 1868, and was buried in Brompton Cemetery. Critical appraisal Romer is described as \\"one of the leading sopranos of her day in English opera\\", with a big voice of great compass, and was a general favourite of audiences. Family Her brother, Frank Romer, musical composer and member of a publishing firm, died in 1889. Her sister Helen (d. 1890) was wife of Mark Lemon, founding editor of both Punch and The Field. Ann Romer (d. 1852), the vocalist, who married William Brough, was Emma Romer's first cousin.

PredictIt is owned and operated by Victoria University of Wellington with support from Aristotle, Inc. The market was launched on 3 November 2014. PredictIt's office is located in Washington, D.C. History PredictIt was launched on 3 November 2014. By March 2020, the website had approximately 100,000 active traders. The nonprofit educational project of the Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand, \\"had to work around federal laws that prohibit online gambling and govern commodity futures trading.\\" During the 2016 United States elections, PredictIt, along with other prediction market websites, received attention from various media outlets. Trading format PredictIt uses a continuous double auction to sell shares for each event in its markets, meaning that for every person who predicts that an event will take place, there must be another person who predicts that it will not. The site groups related predictions into a market. PredictIt's operating expenses are covered by charging a fee of 10% on earnings in excess of the original investment and by charging an additional 5% withdrawal fee.https://www.predictit.org/About/HowItWorks Rules and limits Victoria University of Wellington secured a no-action letter from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, eliminating the risk of prosecution for illegal online gambling. In order to secure the no-action letter, each question is limited to 5,000 traders, and there is an $850 cap on individual investments per question. These restrictions are modeled after the Iowa Electronic Markets, which previously secured a no-action letter from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. However, there are differences in the restrictions between the two markets. Data sharing program PredictIt offers a data sharing program for members of the academic community. PredictIt has over 160 data partners, including researchers affiliated with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Harvard University, Yale University, Duke University, and the University of Pennsylvania.
