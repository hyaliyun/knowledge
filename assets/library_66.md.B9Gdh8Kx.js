Etymology The genus name, Marivagia, is derived from the Latin 'mari' (sea) and 'vagus' (wanderer), while the species name is from the Latin 'stella' (star) for the dots and star-burst like pattern on the exumbrella. Identification The earliest specimen of Marivagia stellata was collected off the coast of Tel Shikmona, at the southern entrance to the port city of Haifa, in 2006. It was photographed, preserved and then sent for identification in Australia, but was lost en route. A larger specimen was collected at nearby Bat Galim on June 29, 2010, while a smaller one was found at Beit Yanai on July 7. Photographs taken in June 2010 off Rosh Hanikra, on the Israeli-Lebanese border, documented live specimens. Characteristics Star-shaped and with a diameter of about 15 centimeters, M. stellata is \\"life translucent bluish-white jelly, with conspicuous pattern of reddish stars, dots and streaks clustered in centre third of exumbrella\\". Three characteristics of the family Cepheidae, the radial canals, exumbrellar morphology and subumbrellar appendages, place it firmly among the Cepheids. Genetic analysis also placed it in close proximity to the Cepheids. M. stellata, however, displays several markedly different morphological features from all other Cepheid genera and cannot be placed within an existing genus. The coast of the southeastern Levant has been inundated by alien biota and it is unlikely that M. stellata, markedly different from all known scyphozoans in the Mediterranean, is a native species. Its discovery in the vicinity of Haifa, a major port, suggests that it is indeed an invasive species. It most likely originates in the Indian Ocean, probably introduced by vessels traversing the Suez Canal. The identification of sexually mature specimens, in both winter and summer, and at sites nearly 90 km apart, suggests a local population has been established. Reports of a new and previously unknown type of jellyfish near the southern Lebanese port of Sidon have also appeared in the Lebanese press, though these have yet to be explicitly linked to M. stellata.

Romero, was a statesman and diplomat from the Philippines. He represented Negros Oriental's Second District and was Majority Floor Leader during the Ninth and Tenth Philippine Legislatures and the First and Second National Assemblies of the Philippines. He was senator-elect of the First Congress of the Philippines and later became the first Philippine ambassador to the United Kingdom and Secretary of Education. Early life and education Romero was born 3 March 1897, one of three children born to Francisco Romero Sr., mayor of Tanjay, Negros Oriental from 1909 to 1916 and later a member of the Provincial Board of Negros Oriental, and Josefa Calumpang Mu√±oz, daughter of Tanjay gobernadorcillo Don Jos√© Teves Mu√±oz and Do√±a Aleja Ines Calumpang, a great-granddaughter of Don Fernando Velaz de Medrano Bracamonte y D√°vila (es), Marquis of Tabu√©rniga de Velazar (es), 15th Marquis of Ca√±ete (GE) (es), 6th Marquis of Fuente el Sol (es), 8th Marquis of Navamorcuende (es), 15th Lord of Montalbo, and Knight of the Order of St. John. Beginning in 1904, he received primary instruction in the public schools of Tanjay where he spent his formative years. In 1905, he moved to study at Silliman Institute in Dumaguete, Negros Oriental. In 1907, when he was only 10 years old, he was appointed municipal school teacher in Tanjay. From 1908 to 1913, he studied at the Negros Oriental High School for secondary education until he went on to Manila High School where he finished in 1915. As a student in Manila, he was the ward of his father‚Äôs only sister Adela Romero de Prats and her husband Francisco Prats Mestre. Romero completed his Associate of Arts degree at Silliman Institute and then went on to the University of the Philippines (UP) to finish a Bachelor's degree graduating cum laude in 1917. As a student at UP, he was awarded first prize in a university-wide poetry contest. He also received the Quezon medal in an oratorical contest and was awarded first prize in the Philippines Free Press literary contest for UP students. After graduation, he enrolled at the University of the Philippines College of Law but had to temporarily postpone his studies due to ill health. He eventually returned to law school upon recovery and completed his Bachelor of Laws degree in 1922. He was admitted to the Philippine Bar and practiced law in Manila before returning to Negros Oriental in 1924. On 17 July 1918, Romero and Carlos P. Romulo led the first student protest march at UP to show support for university president Ignacio Villamor who was then being criticized and defamed by newspaper columnist Manuel Xerez Burgos of The Manila Times. In April 1922, Romero was a delegate to the World Student Christian Federation conference held at Tsinghua University in Beijing. Romero published The Rising Philippines in 1917, the first English language magazine published by Filipinos, together with Romulo, Mauro Mendez and Fernando Maramag as editor- in-chief. He succeeded Maramag as editor of the Philippines National Weekly from 1918 to 1920. Later on, he was the sole owner and publisher of the Oriental Negros Chronicle. Romero also wrote the lyrics of the university hymn of the Philippine Women's University. Political career Romero, together with his cousin Angel Calumpang, was elected to the Provincial Board of Negros Oriental for two consecutive terms from 1925 to 1928 and from 1928 to 1931 during the incumbency of Atilano Villegas as provincial governor. In 1931, he was elected to the 9th Philippine Legislature as representative of Negros Oriental's second district. In 1934, he became majority floor leader replacing Francisco Varona. In the same year, he became a delegate to the 1934 Constitutional Convention that drafted the 1935 Philippine Constitution. He was reelected to the 10th Philippine Legislature and remained as majority floor leader, which only lasted until the following year when it was effectively replaced by a unicameral national assembly as a result of the 1935 Constitution. In 1935, Romero was elected to the National Assembly. He served for two consecutive terms and was majority floor leader from 1935 to 1938 and from 1938 to 1941. He was also chairman of the Congressional standing committee on education. In 1937, he was appointed by Manuel L. Quezon to the Joint Preparatory Committee on Philippine Affairs (JPCPA), which was convened to study the United States Tariff Commission report and review the trade provisions of the Tydings‚ÄìMcDuffie Act, officially known as the Philippine Independence Act. In 1939, during a meeting convoked by President Quezon, he called for an indefinite suspension of the planned 1946 Philippine independence, which was under the threat of World War II. Together with fellow assemblymen Salvador Z. Araneta, Tomas Oppus and Carlos Tan, they formed the Philippine Civic League, which conducted education campaigns on the problems and deficiencies of the Philippine independence mission. In 1946, Romero was elected to the Philippine Senate but was replaced by Prospero Sanidad after a highly-politicized electoral protest filed against him and senators-elect Ramon M. Diokno and Jose O. Vera, and elected members of congress belonging to the Democratic Alliance. Government service In 1917, after finishing his undergraduate degree, he worked as an assessor at the Bureau of Customs but only stayed on for four months due to conflicts in schedule with his classes at law school. Romero was appointed as a member of the Philippine Surplus Property Commission by Manuel Roxas in 1948. On 20 August 1949, Romero was appointed by Elpidio Quirino as envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary of the Philippine foreign service. He took his oath of office on 6 September 1949 as minister of the Philippine Legation to London, replacing Don Ramon Fernandez who was appointed to the Philippine Council of State. He was accredited by the Court of St. James's on 9 November 1949. The legation was later upgraded to embassy status with Romero serving as the first ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary of the Philippines to the Court of St. James's. While ambassador, he headed the Philippine delegation, which included senator Jos√© Locsin, to the 1953 International Sugar Agreement conference held in London convened by the United Nations. In 1953, he ended his tour of duty when he resigned to become the representative of the Philippine Sugar Association (PSA) to Washington for whom he was longtime executive officer and secretary-treasurer, and later president. Upon the recommendation of the PSA, he served as a director of the Philippine Sugar Institute (PHILSUGIN), an agency tasked to conduct research work for the sugar industry in all its phases, agricultural and industrial. PHILSUGIN together with the then Sugar Quota Administration (SQA) effectively replaced the Philippine Sugar Administration in 1951. In May 1956, together with Joaqu√≠n M. Elizalde who was chief delegate, they represented the Philippines at the International Sugar Agreement meeting that year, which opened at the Headquarters of the United Nations in New York. Romero served as Secretary of Education to Carlos P. Garcia and Diosdado P. Macapagal from 1959 to 1961 and from 1961 to 1962 respectively. He was then concurrently ex-officio chairman of the Jose Rizal National Centennial Commission, a commission created in 1954 by Ramon Magsaysay to spearhead preparations for the centenary of Jos√© Rizal's birth in 1961. He was also ex-officio chairman of the Board of Regents of the University of the Philippines. On 13 August 1959, Romero issued Department Order (D.O.) no. 7, s. 1959 ordering the use of the term Pilipino as the proper name for the national language of the Philippines, which up until that point was referred to as either wikang pambansa or Tagalog.

Reyes and Calixto Zaldivar, Central Bank Governor Miguel Cuaderno Sr., and Senator Salvador Z. Araneta founded the Philippine Constitution Association (PHILCONSA) to defend, preserve and protect the Constitution. A longtime member of the Nacionalista Party, he ran for a seat in the senate during the 1961 Philippine Senate election but lost where all but two candidates of the Nacionalista ticket, Lorenzo S. Sumulong and Jose J. Roy, won. In 1970, he ran for a seat as delegate to the Constitutional Convention that year representing the first district of Negros Oriental but lost. In 1973, Romero became president of Bel-Air Village Association, which manages Barangay Bel-Air, a gated community in Makati City, where he was a resident. Romero died on 23 October 1978 in Manila, Philippines and is buried at the Manila North Cemetery.

Overlying the Monterey Formation, it is of upper Miocene and lower Pliocene age (from about 4 to 6 million years old).Isaacs, Caroline M. and Rullk√∂tter, J√ºrgen. The Monterey Formation: From Rocks to Molecules. Columbia University Press, 2001. p. 211. The formation consists of claystone, mudstone, siltstone, shale, diatomite, and conglomerates, with considerable regional variation, and was deposited in a moderately deep marine environment at a depth of approximately . Since some of its diatomites, along with those of the underlying Monterey Formation, are of unusual purity and extent, they can be mined as diatomaceous earth. France-based Imerys operates a mine in the Sisquoc and Monterey Formations in the hills south of Lompoc, California, the largest such operation in the world. Type locality, description, and occurrence The type locality for the Sisquoc Formation is along the Sisquoc River, in northern Santa Barbara County, about a mile east of its confluence with Foxen Canyon.Dibblee (1966) 51 In this location the formation consists mainly of sandstones, but also some siltstone and diatomite, and is about 1,100 feet thick. In other places, such as in the Purisima Hills north of Lompoc, in and adjacent to the Lompoc Oil Field, its total thickness reaches 5,000 feet.California Department of Conservation, Division of Oil, Gas, and Geothermal Resources (DOGGR). California Oil and Gas Fields, Volumes I, II and III. Vol. I (1998), Vol. II (1992), Vol. III (1982). PDF file available on CD from consrv.ca.gov. p. 238Dibblee (1950), 43-44 Diatomite is a major component of the formation in the hills north and south of Lompoc, where it is interbedded with diatomaceous clay shale. The lowest portion of the formation in the Purisima Hills contains tar, for it is here that the unit forms an impermeable cap on the underlying Monterey reservoir of the Lompoc Oil Field. The Sisquoc Formation is not as resistant to erosion as other formations in the stratigraphic sequence in coastal California, and south of the Santa Ynez Mountains it weathers to hilly terrain with gray soil that supports grasses. It outcrops rarely, being best exposed in road cuts, along rivers, and especially along the cliffs on the coast, where it is easily visible from the beach. Many prominent exposures of the Sisquoc occur along the beaches from Santa Barbara west to Gaviota. In the Santa Maria Basin ‚Äì the area surrounding the city of Santa Maria and the hills to the south and southwest ‚Äì well- weathered outcrops of the formation are often bleached white.Nuel C. Henderson, Jr. and Pedro C. Ramirez. \\"Control exerted by lithologic variations and pebbly units on petroleum occurrences in the Pliocene Upper Sisquoc Formation, Casmalia Hills, Santa Maria Basin, California.\\" SEPM Core Workshop No. 14. San Francisco, June 3, 1990. p. 339-340 Deposition environment Close-up photograph of the Sisquoc Formation, showing the friable, planiform nature of the rock on a weathered surface. Rock hammer for scale. The Sisquoc Formation was deposited in a middle bathyal environment, at a depth of between 150 and 1500 meters, between approximately 4 and 6 million years ago ‚Äì the upper Miocene and lower Pliocene eras.Isaacs, 220 During this time, the region was continuing to subside; as a result, sediments deposited later in the period tend to be finer-grained, since the deeper the water, the finer the sediment deposited there.Dibblee (1966) 52 Even though the deposition environment was far from shore, the unit contains occasional conglomerates. One such unit near More Mesa Beach in Santa Barbara, containing clasts from the underlying Monterey Formation, was probably the result of a submarine landslide, bringing down pebbles and boulders from that older formation, which had already been uplifted onshore.Minor et al., Figure 13 The bulk of the Sisquoc north of the Santa Ynez River was deposited as a fine mud, rich with diatoms. Tests of these tiny marine creatures form diatomite, and some of their organic remains persist as the high organic carbon content of parts of the formation (when conditions are right, these organic remains form petroleum reservoirs). South of the Santa Ynez Mountains, the ocean was deeper and the formation consists of finer muds and clays. Going east along the Santa Ynez River, the Sisquoc Formation grades into the Tequepis Sandstone, in which diatomite is gradually replaced by sandstones of granitic origin.Dibblee (1966) 53-54 Paleontology Numerous fossils have been found in the Sisquoc Formation. Within Santa Barbara County, the Sisquoc alone has produced 127 separate finds, which are catalogued by the University of California, Berkeley Museum of Paleontology.County of Santa Barbara. Paleontological Resources section from the Lompoc Wind Project Final Environmental Impact Report . 3.12-3 In addition to the abundant diatoms which make up the diatomite, fossils include vertebrates such as sea lions and walruses, bony and cartilaginous fishes, and birds. Additional fossils include radiolarians, arenaceous foraminifers, and remains of sponges. Economic importance Diatomite quarries near Lompoc, California (2009), are a major source of diatomaceous earth. The Sisquoc Formation is important as a source of diatomaceous earth and as a petroleum reservoir. As a stratigraphic member of petroleum reservoirs, it can be both a reservoir and a sealing unit. Sometimes, as in the Lompoc Oil Field, it serves as an impermeable cap rock to an oil-bearing unit, in that case in the Monterey Formation; in other cases, such as in the Casmalia Oil Field and the offshore portion of the Ellwood Oil Field, it is an oil-bearing unit in its own right.DOGGR, p. 658-659 In the Casmalia field, west of Santa Maria, pebbly and high-porosity units contain a considerable amount of oil, while clay-rich and diatomaceous mudstones contain almost none. While most of the oil found in the Sisquoc Formation has gotten there by migrating upward from the underlying Monterey Formation, the primary source rock for petroleum in southwestern California, sometimes the Sisquoc is itself a source rock. In places the formation contains enough organic carbon ‚Äì up to six percent ‚Äì to generate oil under the right conditions, such as burial in deep synclines with high enough temperature and sufficient time (several million years) to cause the kerogen from the decomposing organic matter to be matured, via hydrocarbon cracking, into petroleum.Isaacs et al., p. 213 The diatomites of the Sisquoc, like those of the Monterey, can function both as oil-bearing units ‚Äì where they have been capped with impermeable beds ‚Äì or they may be oil-free, in which case, if they are near the surface and of sufficient purity, they can be mined as diatomaceous earth. The world's largest such deposit, operated by Imerys, is in the Sisquoc and Monterey formations in the hills south of Lompoc, California; the USGS estimates that the Lompoc mine alone with its large reserves could meet the needs of the entire world for centuries.Dolley, Thomas P.

The point (+) in the convex hull of the Minkowski sum of the four non- convex sets (right) is the sum of four points (+) from the (left-hand) sets‚Äîtwo points in two non-convex sets plus two points in the convex hulls of two sets. The convex hulls are shaded pink. The original sets each have exactly two points (shown as red dots). The Shapley‚ÄìFolkman lemma is a result in convex geometry with applications in mathematical economics that describes the Minkowski addition of sets in a vector space. Minkowski addition is defined as the addition of the sets' members: for example, adding the set consisting of the integers zero and one to itself yields the set consisting of zero, one, and two: : {0, 1} + {0, 1} = {0 + 0, 0 + 1, 1 + 0, 1 + 1} = {0, 1, 2}. The Shapley‚ÄìFolkman lemma and related results provide an affirmative answer to the question, \\"Is the sum of many sets close to being convex?\\": A set is defined to be convex if every line segment joining two of its points is a subset in the set: For example, the solid disk \\\\bullet is a convex set but the circle \\\\circ is not, because the line segment joining two distinct points \\\\oslash is not a subset of the circle. The Shapley‚ÄìFolkman lemma suggests that if the number of summed sets exceeds the dimension of the vector space, then their Minkowski sum is approximately convex. The Shapley‚ÄìFolkman lemma was introduced as a step in the proof of the Shapley‚ÄìFolkman theorem, which states an upper bound on the distance between the Minkowski sum and its convex hull. The convex hull of a set Q is the smallest convex set that contains Q. This distance is zero if and only if the sum is convex. The theorem's bound on the distance depends on the dimension D and on the shapes of the summand-sets, but not on the number of summand-sets N, The shapes of a subcollection of only D summand-sets determine the bound on the distance between the Minkowski average of N sets : (Q1 \\\\+ Q2 \\\\+ ... + QN) and its convex hull. As N increases to infinity, the bound decreases to zero (for summand-sets of uniformly bounded size). The Shapley‚ÄìFolkman theorem's upper bound was decreased by Starr's corollary (alternatively, the Shapley‚ÄìFolkman‚ÄìStarr theorem). The lemma of Lloyd Shapley and Jon Folkman was first published by the economist Ross M. Starr, who was investigating the existence of economic equilibria while studying with Kenneth Arrow. In his paper, Starr studied a convexified economy, in which non-convex sets were replaced by their convex hulls; Starr proved that the convexified economy has equilibria that are closely approximated by \\"quasi-equilibria\\" of the original economy; moreover, he proved that every quasi-equilibrium has many of the optimal properties of true equilibria, which are proved to exist for convex economies. Following Starr's 1969 paper, the Shapley‚ÄìFolkman‚ÄìStarr results have been widely used to show that central results of (convex) economic theory are good approximations to large economies with non-convexities; for example, quasi-equilibria closely approximate equilibria of a convexified economy. \\"The derivation of these results in general form has been one of the major achievements of postwar economic theory\\", wrote Roger Guesnerie. The topic of non-convex sets in economics has been studied by many Nobel laureates, besides Lloyd Shapley who won the prize in 2012: Arrow (1972), Robert Aumann (2005), G√©rard Debreu (1983), Tjalling Koopmans (1975), Paul Krugman (2008), and Paul Samuelson (1970); the complementary topic of convex sets in economics has been emphasized by these laureates, along with Leonid Hurwicz, Leonid Kantorovich (1975), and Robert Solow (1987). The Shapley‚ÄìFolkman lemma has applications also in optimization and probability theory. In optimization theory, the Shapley‚ÄìFolkman lemma has been used to explain the successful solution of minimization problems that are sums of many functions. The Shapley‚ÄìFolkman lemma has also been used in proofs of the \\"law of averages\\" for random sets, a theorem that had been proved for only convex sets. Introductory example For example, the subset of the integers {0, 1, 2} is contained in the interval of real numbers [0, 2], which is convex. The Shapley‚ÄìFolkman lemma implies that every point in [0, 2] is the sum of an integer from {0, 1} and a real number from [0, 1]. The distance between the convex interval [0, 2] and the non-convex set {0, 1, 2} equals one-half : 1/2 = 1 ‚àí 1/2 = 0 ‚àí 1/2 = 2 ‚àí 3/2 = 1 ‚àí 3/2. However, the distance between the average Minkowski sum : 1/2 ( {0, 1} + {0, 1} ) = {0, 1/2, 1} and its convex hull [0, 1] is only 1/4, which is half the distance (1/2) between its summand {0, 1} and [0, 1]. As more sets are added together, the average of their sum \\"fills out\\" its convex hull: The maximum distance between the average and its convex hull approaches zero as the average includes more summands. Preliminaries The Shapley‚ÄìFolkman lemma depends upon the following definitions and results from convex geometry. Real vector spaces A real vector space of two dimensions can be given a Cartesian coordinate system in which every point is identified by an ordered pair of real numbers, called \\"coordinates\\", which are conventionally denoted by x and y. Two points in the Cartesian plane can be added coordinate-wise : (x1, y1) + (x2, y2) = (x1+x2, y1+y2); further, a point can be multiplied by each real number Œª coordinate-wise : Œª (x, y) = (Œªx, Œªy). More generally, any real vector space of (finite) dimension D can be viewed as the set of all D-tuples of D real numbers } on which two operations are defined: vector addition and multiplication by a real number. For finite- dimensional vector spaces, the operations of vector addition and real-number multiplication can each be defined coordinate-wise, following the example of the Cartesian plane. Convex sets In a real vector space, a non-empty set Q is defined to be convex if, for each pair of its points, every point on the line segment that joins them is a subset of Q. For example, a solid disk \\\\bullet is convex but a circle \\\\circ is not, because it does not contain a line segment joining its points \\\\oslash; the non-convex set of three integers {0, 1, 2} is contained in the interval [0, 2], which is convex. For example, a solid cube is convex; however, anything that is hollow or dented, for example, a crescent shape, is non-convex. The empty set is convex, either by definition or vacuously, depending on the author. More formally, a set Q is convex if, for all points v0 and v1 in Q and for every real number Œª in the unit interval [0,1], the point : (1 ‚àí Œª) v0 \\\\+ Œªv1 is a member of Q. By mathematical induction, a set Q is convex if and only if every convex combination of members of Q also belongs to Q. By definition, a convex combination of an indexed subset {v0, v1, . . . , vD} of a vector space is any weighted average for some indexed set of non-negative real numbers {Œªd} satisfying the equation = 1., , and The definition of a convex set implies that the intersection of two convex sets is a convex set. More generally, the intersection of a family of convex sets is a convex set. In particular, the intersection of two disjoint sets is the empty set, which is convex. Convex hull In the convex hull of the red set, each blue point is a convex combination of some red points. For every subset Q of a real vector space, its is the minimal convex set that contains Q. Thus Conv(Q) is the intersection of all the convex sets that cover Q. The convex hull of a set can be equivalently defined to be the set of all convex combinations of points in Q. and For example, the convex hull of the set of integers {0,1} is the closed interval of real numbers [0,1], which contains the integer end-points. The convex hull of the unit circle is the closed unit disk, which contains the unit circle. Minkowski addition Minkowski addition of sets. The sum of the squares Q_{1}=[0,1]^{2} and Q_{2}=[1,2]^{2} is the square Q_{1}+Q_{2}=[1,3]^{2}2. In any vector space (or algebraic structure with addition), X, the Minkowski sum of two non-empty sets A, B\\\\subseteq X is defined to be the element-wise operation A+B := {x+y\\\\mid x\\\\in A,~y\\\\in B}. (See also. and ) For example :{0,1}+{0,1}={0+0,0+1,1+0,1+1}={0,1,2} This operation is clearly commutative and associative on the collection of non-empty sets. All such operations extend in a well-defined manner to recursive forms \\\\sum_{n=1}^{N}Q_{n}=Q_{1}+Q_{2}+\\\\ldots+Q_{N}. By the principle of induction it is easy to see that and :\\\\sum_{n=1}^{N}Q_{n}={\\\\sum_{n=1}^{N}q_{n}\\\\mid q_{n}\\\\in Q_{n},~1\\\\leq n\\\\leq N}. Convex hulls of Minkowski sums Minkowski addition behaves well with respect to taking convex hulls. Specifically, for all subsets A,B\\\\subseteq X of a real vector space, X, the convex hull of their Minkowski sum is the Minkowski sum of their convex hulls. That is, :\\\\mathrm{Conv}(A+B) = \\\\mathrm{Conv}(A)+\\\\mathrm{Conv}(B). And by induction it follows that :\\\\mathrm{Conv}(\\\\sum_{n=1}^{N}Q_{n}) = \\\\sum_{n=1}^{N}\\\\mathrm{Conv}(Q_{n}) for any N\\\\in\\\\mathbb{N} and non-empty subsets Q_{n}\\\\subseteq X, 1\\\\leq n\\\\leq N. Statements thumbupright=1.35alt=The Shapley‚ÄìFolkman lemma depicted by a diagram with two panes, one on the left and the other on the right. The left-hand pane displays four sets, which are displayed in a two-by-two array. Each of the sets contains exactly two points, which are displayed in red. In each set, the two points are joined by a pink line-segment, which is the convex hull of the original set. Each set has exactly one point that is indicated with a plus- symbol. In the top row of the two-by-two array, the plus-symbol lies in the interior of the line segment; in the bottom row, the plus-symbol coincides with one of the red-points. This completes the description of the left-hand pane of the diagram. The right-hand pane displays the Minkowski sum of the sets, which is the union of the sums having exactly one point from each summand-set; for the displayed sets, the sixteen sums are distinct points, which are displayed in red: The right-hand red sum-points are the sums of the left-hand red summand-points. The convex hull of the sixteen red-points is shaded in pink. In the pink interior of the right-hand sumset lies exactly one plus-symbol, which is the (unique) sum of the plus-symbols from the right-hand side. The right-hand plus-symbol is indeed the sum of the four plus-symbols from the left-hand sets, precisely two points from the original non-convex summand-sets and two points from the convex hulls of the remaining summand- sets. Minkowski addition and convex hulls. The sixteen dark-red points (on the right) form the Minkowski sum of the four non-convex sets (on the left), each of which consists of a pair of red points. Their convex hulls (shaded pink) contain plus-signs (+): The right plus-sign is the sum of the left plus- signs. By the preceding identity, for every point x\\\\in\\\\mathrm{Conv}(\\\\sum_{n=1}^{N}Q_{n}) there exist elements in the convex hulls, q_{n}(x)\\\\in\\\\mathrm{Conv}(Q_{n}) for 1\\\\leq n\\\\leq N, dependent upon x, and such that \\\\sum_{n=1}^{N}q_{n}(x)=x. Lemma of Shapley and Folkman A Winner of the 2012 Nobel Award in Economics, Lloyd Shapley proved the Shapley‚ÄìFolkman lemma with Jon Folkman. Working with the above setup, the Shapley‚ÄìFolkman lemma states that in the above representation : x=\\\\sum_{n=1}^{N}q_{n}(x) at most D of the summands q_{n}(x) need to be taken strictly from the convex hulls. That is, there exists a representation of the above form, such that {l\\\\leq n\\\\leq N\\\\mid q_{n}(x)\\\\in\\\\mathrm{Conv}(Q_{n})\\\\setminus Q_{n}}\\\\leq D. Shuffling indexes if necessary, this means that the point has a representation :x = \\\\sum_{n=1}^{D}q_{n}(x) + \\\\sum_{n=D+1}^{N} q_n(x) where q_{n}\\\\in\\\\mathrm{Conv}(Q_{n}) for 1\\\\leq n\\\\leq D and q_{n}\\\\in Q_{n} for D+1\\\\leq n\\\\leq N. Note that the re-indexing depends on the point. More succinctly, the Shapley‚ÄìFolkman lemma states that :\\\\mathrm{Conv}(\\\\sum_{n=1}^{N}Q_{n})\\\\subseteq\\\\bigcup_{I\\\\subseteq{1,2,\\\\ldots N}:~I=D}\\\\sum_{n\\\\in I}\\\\mathrm{Conv}(Q_{n})+\\\\sum_{n otin I}Q_{n}. As an example, every point in [0,2]=[0,1]+[0,1]=\\\\mathrm{Conv}({0,1})+\\\\mathrm{Conv}({0,1}) is according to the lemma the sum of an element in {0,1} and an element in [0,1]. =Dimension of a real vector space= Conversely, the Shapley‚ÄìFolkman lemma characterizes the dimension of finite-dimensional, real vector spaces. That is, if a vector space obeys the Shapley‚ÄìFolkman lemma for a natural number D, and for no number less than D, then its dimension is exactly D; the Shapley‚ÄìFolkman lemma holds for only finite-dimensional vector spaces. credits this result to : Shapley‚ÄìFolkman theorem and Starr's corollary The circumradius (blue) and inner radius (green) of a point set (dark red, with its convex hull shown as the lighter red dashed lines). The inner radius is smaller than the circumradius except for subsets of a single circle, for which they are equal. Shapley and Folkman used their lemma to prove their theorem, which bounds the distance between a Minkowski sum and its convex hull, the \\"convexified\\" sum: * The Shapley‚ÄìFolkman theorem states that the squared Euclidean distance from any point in the convexified sum to the original (unconvexified) sum is bounded by the sum of the squares of the D largest circumradii of the sets Qn (the radii of the smallest spheres enclosing these sets). This bound is independent of the number of summand-sets N (if The Shapley‚ÄìFolkman theorem states a bound on the distance between the Minkowski sum and its convex hull; this distance is zero if and only if the sum is convex. Their bound on the distance depends on the dimension D and on the shapes of the summand-sets, but not on the number of summand-sets N, The circumradius often exceeds (and cannot be less than) the inner radius: * The inner radius of a set Qn is defined to be the smallest number r such that, for any point q in the convex hull of Qn, there is a sphere of radius r that contains a subset of Qn whose convex hull contains q. Starr used the inner radius to reduce the upper bound stated in the Shapley‚ÄìFolkman theorem: * Starr's corollary to the Shapley‚ÄìFolkman theorem states that the squared Euclidean distance from any point x in the convexified sum to the original (unconvexified) sum is bounded by the sum of the squares of the D largest inner-radii of the sets Qn. Starr's corollary states an upper bound on the Euclidean distance between the Minkowski sum of N sets and the convex hull of the Minkowski sum; this distance between the sum and its convex hull is a measurement of the non-convexity of the set. For simplicity, this distance is called the \\"non-convexity\\" of the set (with respect to Starr's measurement). Thus, Starr's bound on the non-convexity of the sum depends on only the D largest inner radii of the summand-sets; however, Starr's bound does not depend on the number of summand-sets N, when . For example, the distance between the convex interval [0, 2] and the non-convex set {0, 1, 2} equals one-half : 1/2 = 1 ‚àí 1/2 = 0 ‚àí 1/2 = 2 ‚àí 3/2 = 1 ‚àí 3/2. Thus, Starr's bound on the non-convexity of the average : ‚àë Qn decreases as the number of summands N increases. For example, the distance between the averaged set : 1/2 ( {0, 1} + {0, 1} ) = {0, 1/2, 1} and its convex hull [0, 1] is only 1/4, which is half the distance (1/2) between its summand {0, 1} and [0, 1]. The shapes of a subcollection of only D summand-sets determine the bound on the distance between the average set and its convex hull; thus, as the number of summands increases to infinity, the bound decreases to zero (for summand-sets of uniformly bounded size). In fact, Starr's bound on the non-convexity of this average set decreases to zero as the number of summands N increases to infinity (when the inner radii of all the summands are bounded by the same number). Proofs and computations The original proof of the Shapley‚ÄìFolkman lemma established only the existence of the representation, but did not provide an algorithm for computing the representation: Similar proofs have been given by Arrow and Hahn, Cassels, and Schneider, among others. An abstract and elegant proof by Ekeland has been extended by Artstein. Different proofs have appeared in unpublished papers, also. In 1981, Starr published an iterative method for computing a representation of a given sum-point; however, his computational proof provides a weaker bound than does the original result. An elementary proof of the Shapley‚ÄìFolkman lemma in finite-dimensional space can be found in the book by Bertsekas together with applications in estimating the duality gap in separable optimization problems and zero-sum games. Applications The Shapley‚ÄìFolkman lemma enables researchers to extend results for Minkowski sums of convex sets to sums of general sets, which need not be convex. Such sums of sets arise in economics, in mathematical optimization, and in probability theory; in each of these three mathematical sciences, non-convexity is an important feature of applications. Economics prefers every basket of goods on the indifference curve I3 over each basket on I2. The basket (Qx, Qy), where the budget line (shown in blue) supports I2, is optimal and also feasible, unlike any basket lying on I3 which is preferred but unfeasible. In economics, a consumer's preferences are defined over all \\"baskets\\" of goods. Each basket is represented as a non-negative vector, whose coordinates represent the quantities of the goods. On this set of baskets, an indifference curve is defined for each consumer; a consumer's indifference curve contains all the baskets of commodities that the consumer regards as equivalent: That is, for every pair of baskets on the same indifference curve, the consumer does not prefer one basket over another. Through each basket of commodities passes one indifference curve. A consumer's preference set (relative to an indifference curve) is the union of the indifference curve and all the commodity baskets that the consumer prefers over the indifference curve. A consumer's preferences are convex if all such preference sets are convex. and An optimal basket of goods occurs where the budget-line supports a consumer's preference set, as shown in the diagram. This means that an optimal basket is on the highest possible indifference curve given the budget-line, which is defined in terms of a price vector and the consumer's income (endowment vector). Thus, the set of optimal baskets is a function of the prices, and this function is called the consumer's demand. If the preference set is convex, then at every price the consumer's demand is a convex set, for example, a unique optimal basket or a line-segment of baskets. =Non-convex preferences= When the consumer's preferences have concavities, the consumer may jump between two separate optimal baskets. However, if a preference set is non-convex, then some prices determine a budget-line that supports two separate optimal- baskets. For example, we can imagine that, for zoos, a lion costs as much as an eagle, and further that a zoo's budget suffices for one eagle or one lion. We can suppose also that a zoo-keeper views either animal as equally valuable. In this case, the zoo would purchase either one lion or one eagle. Of course, a contemporary zoo-keeper does not want to purchase half of an eagle and half of a lion (or a griffin)! Thus, the zoo-keeper's preferences are non-convex: The zoo-keeper prefers having either animal to having any strictly convex combination of both.: \\"After all, one may be indifferent between an automobile and a boat, but in most cases one can neither drive nor sail the combination of half boat, half car.\\" When the consumer's preference set is non-convex, then (for some prices) the consumer's demand is not connected; a disconnected demand implies some discontinuous behavior by the consumer, as discussed by Harold Hotelling: > If indifference curves for purchases be thought of as possessing a wavy > character, convex to the origin in some regions and concave in others, we > are forced to the conclusion that it is only the portions convex to the > origin that can be regarded as possessing any importance, since the others > are essentially unobservable. They can be detected only by the > discontinuities that may occur in demand with variation in price-ratios, > leading to an abrupt jumping of a point of tangency across a chasm when the > straight line is rotated. But, while such discontinuities may reveal the > existence of chasms, they can never measure their depth. The concave > portions of the indifference curves and their many-dimensional > generalizations, if they exist, must forever remain in unmeasurable > obscurity. : The difficulties of studying non-convex preferences were emphasized by Herman Wold: : and again by Paul Samuelson, who wrote that non-convexities are \\"shrouded in eternal : > It will be noted that any point where the indifference curves are convex > rather than concave cannot be observed in a competitive market. Such points > are shrouded in eternal darkness‚Äîunless we make our consumer a monopsonist > and let him choose between goods lying on a very convex \\"budget curve\\" > (along which he is affecting the price of what he buys). In this monopsony > case, we could still deduce the slope of the man's indifference curve from > the slope of the observed constraint at the equilibrium point. \\"Eternal darkness\\" describes the Hell of John Milton's Paradise Lost, whose concavity is compared to the Serbonian Bog in Book II, lines 592‚Äì594: > A gulf profound as that Serbonian Bog > Betwixt Damiata and Mount Casius old, > Where Armies whole have sunk. Milton's description of concavity serves as the literary epigraph prefacing chapter seven of , \\"Markets with non-convex preferences and production\\", which presents the results of . according to Diewert. Nonetheless, non-convex preferences were illuminated from 1959 to 1961 by a sequence of papers in The Journal of Political Economy (JPE). The main contributors were Farrell, Bator, Koopmans, and others‚Äîfor example, and , , , and ‚Äîcommented on : and Rothenberg.: () In particular, Rothenberg's paper discussed the approximate convexity of sums of non-convex sets. These JPE-papers stimulated a paper by Lloyd Shapley and Martin Shubik, which considered convexified consumer-preferences and introduced the concept of an \\"approximate equilibrium\\".: The JPE-papers and the Shapley‚ÄìShubik paper influenced another notion of \\"quasi-equilibria\\", due to Robert Aumann.: uses results from : Taking the convex hull of non-convex preferences had been discussed earlier by and by , according to . = Starr's 1969 paper and contemporary economics = Kenneth Arrow (1972 Nobel laureate) helped Ross M. Starr to study non-convex economies. Previous publications on non-convexity and economics were collected in an annotated bibliography by Kenneth Arrow. He gave the bibliography to Starr, who was then an undergraduate enrolled in Arrow's (graduate) advanced mathematical- economics course.: In his term-paper, Starr studied the general equilibria of an artificial economy in which non-convex preferences were replaced by their convex hulls. In the convexified economy, at each price, the aggregate demand was the sum of convex hulls of the consumers' demands. Starr's ideas interested the mathematicians Lloyd Shapley and Jon Folkman, who proved their eponymous lemma and theorem in \\"private correspondence\\", which was reported by Starr's published paper of 1969. In his 1969 publication, Starr applied the Shapley‚ÄìFolkman‚ÄìStarr theorem. Starr proved that the \\"convexified\\" economy has general equilibria that can be closely approximated by \\"quasi-equilibria\\" of the original economy, when the number of agents exceeds the dimension of the goods: Concretely, Starr proved that there exists at least one quasi- equilibrium of prices popt with the following properties: * For each quasi- equilibrium's prices popt, all consumers can choose optimal baskets (maximally preferred and meeting their budget constraints). * At quasi-equilibrium prices popt in the convexified economy, every good's market is in equilibrium: Its supply equals its demand. * For each quasi-equilibrium, the prices \\"nearly clear\\" the markets for the original economy: an upper bound on the distance between the set of equilibria of the \\"convexified\\" economy and the set of quasi-equilibria of the original economy followed from Starr's corollary to the Shapley‚ÄìFolkman theorem.. Starr established that > \\"in the aggregate, the discrepancy between an allocation in the fictitious > economy generated by [taking the convex hulls of all of the consumption and > production sets] and some allocation in the real economy is bounded in a way > that is independent of the number of economic agents. Therefore, the average > agent experiences a deviation from intended actions that vanishes in > significance as the number of agents goes to infinity\\". Following Starr's 1969 paper, the Shapley‚ÄìFolkman‚ÄìStarr results have been widely used in economic theory. Roger Guesnerie summarized their economic implications: \\"Some key results obtained under the convexity assumption remain (approximately) relevant in circumstances where convexity fails. For example, in economies with a large consumption side, preference nonconvexities do not destroy the standard results\\". \\"The derivation of these results in general form has been one of the major achievements of postwar economic theory\\", wrote Guesnerie. The topic of non-convex sets in economics has been studied by many Nobel laureates: Arrow (1972), Robert Aumann (2005), G√©rard Debreu (1983), Tjalling Koopmans (1975), Paul Krugman (2008), and Paul Samuelson (1970); the complementary topic of convex sets in economics has been emphasized by these laureates, along with Leonid Hurwicz, Leonid Kantorovich (1975), and Robert Solow (1987). The Shapley‚ÄìFolkman‚ÄìStarr results have been featured in the economics literature: in microeconomics,: : in general-equilibrium theory, : : : : in public economics (including market failures),: as well as in game theory,: in mathematical economics,: and in applied mathematics (for economists). The Shapley‚ÄìFolkman‚ÄìStarr results have also influenced economics research using measure and integration theory.: Mathematical optimization A function is convex if the region above its graph is a convex set. The Shapley‚ÄìFolkman lemma has been used to explain why large minimization problems with non- convexities can be nearly solved (with iterative methods whose convergence proofs are stated for only convex problems). The Shapley‚ÄìFolkman lemma has encouraged the use of methods of convex minimization on other applications with sums of many functions. =Preliminaries of optimization theory= Nonlinear optimization relies on the following definitions for functions: *The graph of a function f is the set of the pairs of arguments x and function evaluations f(x) : Graph(f) = { (x, f(x) ) } * The epigraph of a real-valued function f is the set of points above the graph sine function is non-convex. : Epi(f) = { (x, u) : f(x) ‚â§ u }. *A real-valued function is defined to be a convex function if its epigraph is a convex set. For example, the quadratic function f(x) = x2 is convex, as is the absolute value function g(x) = x. However, the sine function (pictured) is non-convex on the interval (0, œÄ). =Additive optimization problems= In many optimization problems, the objective function f is separable: that is, f is the sum of many summand- functions, each of which has its own argument: : f(x) = f( (x1, ..., xN) ) = ‚àë fn(xn). For example, problems of linear optimization are separable. Given a separable problem with an optimal solution, we fix an optimal solution : xmin = (x1, ..., xN)min with the minimum value For this separable problem, we also consider an optimal solution (xmin, f(xmin) ) to the \\"convexified problem\\", where convex hulls are taken of the graphs of the summand functions. Such an optimal solution is the limit of a sequence of points in the convexified problem : (xj, f(xj) ) ‚àà ‚àë Conv (Graph( fn ) ). The limit of a sequence is a member of the closure of the original set, which is the smallest closed set that contains the original set. The Minkowski sum of two closed sets need not be closed, so the following inclusion can be strict : Clos(P) + Clos(Q) ‚äÜ Clos( Clos(P) + Clos(Q) ); the inclusion can be strict even for two convex closed summand-sets, according to . Ensuring that the Minkowski sum of sets be closed requires the closure operation, which appends limits of convergent sequences. Of course, the given optimal-point is a sum of points in the graphs of the original summands and of a small number of convexified summands, by the Shapley‚ÄìFolkman lemma. This analysis was published by Ivar Ekeland in 1974 to explain the apparent convexity of separable problems with many summands, despite the non-convexity of the summand problems. In 1973, the young mathematician Claude Lemar√©chal was surprised by his success with convex minimization methods on problems that were known to be non-convex; for minimizing nonlinear problems, a solution of the dual problem need not provide useful information for solving the primal problem, unless the primal problem be convex and satisfy a constraint qualification. Lemar√©chal's problem was additively separable, and each summand function was non-convex; nonetheless, a solution to the dual problem provided a close approximation to the primal problem's optimal value.: . Lemar√©chal's experiments were discussed in later publications: : : : Published in the first English edition of 1976, Ekeland's appendix proves the Shapley‚ÄìFolkman lemma, also acknowledging Lemar√©chal's experiments on page 373. Ekeland's analysis explained the success of methods of convex minimization on large and separable problems, despite the non-convexities of the summand functions. Ekeland and later authors argued that additive separability produced an approximately convex aggregate problem, even though the summand functions were non-convex. The crucial step in these publications is the use of the Shapley‚ÄìFolkman lemma.: and also considered the convex closure of a problem of non-convex minimization‚Äîthat is, the problem defined as the closed convex hull of the epigraph of the original problem. Their study of duality gaps was extended by Di Guglielmo to the quasiconvex closure of a non-convex minimization problem‚Äîthat is, the problem defined as the closed convex hull of the lower level sets: : The Shapley‚ÄìFolkman lemma has encouraged the use of methods of convex minimization on other applications with sums of many functions. acknowledging on page 374 and on page 381: describes an application of Lagrangian dual methods to the scheduling of electrical power plants (\\"unit commitment problems\\"), where non-convexity appears because of integer constraints: Proceedings of 1981 IEEE Conference on Decision and Control, San Diego, CA, December 1981, pp. 432‚Äì443. : : Probability and measure theory Convex sets are often studied with probability theory. Each point in the convex hull of a (non-empty) subset Q of a finite-dimensional space is the expected value of a simple random vector that takes its values in Q, as a consequence of Carath√©odory's lemma. Thus, for a non-empty set Q, the collection of the expected values of the simple, Q-valued random vectors equals Q convex hull; this equality implies that the Shapley‚ÄìFolkman‚ÄìStarr results are useful in probability theory.: In the other direction, probability theory provides tools to examine convex sets generally and the Shapley‚ÄìFolkman‚ÄìStarr results specifically.: The Shapley‚ÄìFolkman‚ÄìStarr results have been widely used in the probabilistic theory of random sets,: for example, to prove a law of large numbers,: : a central limit theorem,: and a large-deviations principle.: Cerf uses applications of the Shapley‚ÄìFolkman lemma from . These proofs of probabilistic limit theorems used the Shapley‚ÄìFolkman‚ÄìStarr results to avoid the assumption that all the random sets be convex. A probability measure is a finite measure, and the Shapley‚ÄìFolkman lemma has applications in non-probabilistic measure theory, such as the theories of volume and of vector measures. The Shapley‚ÄìFolkman lemma enables a refinement of the Brunn‚ÄìMinkowski inequality, which bounds the volume of sums in terms of the volumes of their summand- sets.: The volume of a set is defined in terms of the Lebesgue measure, which is defined on subsets of Euclidean space. In advanced measure-theory, the Shapley‚ÄìFolkman lemma has been used to prove Lyapunov's theorem, which states that the range of a vector measure is convex.: Here, the traditional term \\"range\\" (alternatively, \\"image\\") is the set of values produced by the function. A vector measure is a vector-valued generalization of a measure; for example, if p1 and p2 are probability measures defined on the same measurable space, then the product function is a vector measure, where is defined for every event œâ by :(p1 p2)(œâ)=(p1(œâ), p2(œâ)). Lyapunov's theorem has been used in economics,: Vind's article was noted by the winner of the 1983 Nobel Prize in Economics, G√©rard Debreu. wrote: > The concept of a convex set (i.e., a set containing the segment connecting > any two of its points) had repeatedly been placed at the center of economic > theory before 1964\\\\.

The game was released on October 14, 2009 for the Xbox 360's Xbox Live Arcade service and on October 7, 2010 for Steam. The game revolves around Axel, a painter, and his dog Pixel, who awake in a beautiful, yet perilous, dream world of Axel's own creation. Together, they must solve the mysteries of Axel's landscapes to get through the dream world by defeating the Ice Giant and helping Axel fulfill his greatest wish - to paint a picture of all four seasons in a single day. Gameplay The game is a traditional point-and- click adventure, where the player has to logically come up with answers and solutions to riddles and problems that are encountered during the course of the game. As a way of making Axel & Pixel unique from other point-and-click adventures, the cursor is made up of a group of glittering lights, which change colour slightly if the player lands the cursor on a point of interest. Aside from the traditional point-and-click mechanics, the game also features different platform mini-games (hot-air balloon through a cave, driving through the mountains, or sailing a boat downstream). The game also makes use of quick time events in a few of the chapters as ways of helping Axel scale walls or avoiding dangerous obstacles. The game is divided into four sections - in the form of the four calendar seasons - which are unlocked through natural progression of the story. Each of the mini-games featured are used once in story mode as ways of pursuing Evil Rat through the dream world, from the last chapter of the current calendar season into the beginning of the next one. Unlike most point-and-click adventures, Axel & Pixel contains no dialogue option between characters, in an attempt to keep the gameplay focused more on solving the puzzles instead of interactions. Axel, however, will speak gibberish to Pixel and to himself occasionally. Plot Axel & Pixel tells the story of a painter, Axel, and his dog, Pixel, as they embark on a fantastic journey through the surreal and dangerous dream world of Axel's own artistic creation after the two are hypnotised by a lullaby record. Upon entering the dream world, the primary antagonist, Evil Rat, is found to be in possession of the key which Axel needs to exit the dream world. The first chapter features the same snowy environment outside as in the real world - albeit, with an array of weird and wonderful creatures - but, upon completion of the chapter, the pair move into Spring, where the environments are very flowered, colourful and are inhabited by creatures such as giant honeybees, hard-shelled sheep and a plethora of insect species. Arriving at a derelict temple, Evil Rat destroys a large monument of a golden snake with a missile. After re-assembling the monument and obtaining the paint brush atop the monument, Evil Rat flees the scene on a missile - using it as a form of transport - while Axel quickly paints a hot air balloon in thin air with the paintbrush and boards it with Pixel to pursue Evil Rat into Summer. Upon arriving in Summer, Pixel is snatched and taken away by a giant dragonfly. Like Spring, the environments are very flowered, but now feature a new selection of creatures, such as large, orange boars; piranha worms and a giant tortoise with continuous track wheels instead of hind legs. After saving a marooned Pixel from a piranha worm-infested pond, the two are reunited and move on where they encounter the iconic giant tortoise with continuous track wheels. The pair encounter Evil Rat again shortly after, who appears to be constructing a ramshackle automobile shortly before Axel soaks him with an ornamental water feature and he drives off hurriedly. Axel quickly paints a bright yellow car in thin air and the pair give chase through a series of hills into Autumn, where the environments now feature a much more vibrant tone in colour, with an emphasis on oranges and, especially, browns. Upon arriving in Autumn, Axel totals his car into the side of a mountain, which he resolves by inflating the tyre to bursting-point and bouncing on it to get to the higher cliffs. As the only way of exiting the cliffs, Axel restores the power to a nearby ski lift, giving the pair the chance to escape. The ski lift drops the pair off at a beaver dam, where they encounter Pesky Hedgehog guarding a ladder to the sewers. Pole vaulting across the river, Axel, with Pixel's help, uncovers a hidden giant catapult, which Axel proceeds to fill with boulders, firing them at the nearby dam, eventually breaking through, sweeping Pesky Hedgehog off his feet and carrying him away in the waves, leaving Axel and Pixel to descend into the sewers. The pair finally re-emerge above ground after Axel restores power to an escalator. Arriving at an oil well, the pair encounter Evil Rat just before he speeds off in a ramshackle speedboat. After clearing the nearby lake of an oil spill, Axel obtains a paintbrush from a newly reanimated tree and paints his final vehicle in thin air: a small sail boat which the pair use to pursue Evil Rat through icy, whirlpool-laden waters into Winter, where the environments are now covered in ice, snow and coloured with white, blues and black, and feature creatures typically suited to colder climates, such as penguins, a large snow cat and a sarcopterygii fish. Upon arriving in Winter, Evil Rat - disguised as a snowman - knocks Axel into the icy river with a snowball, who surfaces completely encapsulated in ice. Pixel, who managed to jump out of the boat in time, hoists the frozen Axel onto a nearby sled and the pair take off down the side of the mountain into a cave where Pixel manages to melt the ice around Axel with steam from a boiler pipe. With Axel fully mobile, the pair solve their final puzzle by playing a secret tune on a set of ice drums, opening the doors to the Ice Giant's lair. Inside, Axel defeats Evil Rat with snowballs and claims the key back to reality, but not before defeating the Ice Giant in a series of QTEs; Axel manages to climb atop the Ice Giant's head where the final paintbrush is located, which Axel uses to paint a wrecking ball in thin air, knocking the Ice Giant down into a chasm. Having thwarted the Ice Giant, Axel paints the doors to reality in thin air and the pair enter, where Axel (depending on whether the player collected all of the tubes of paint and paintings), with his newly obtained muse, fulfils his greatest wish by painting a picture of the four seasons in a single day. Reception Upon its release to Xbox Live Arcade, Axel & Pixel was met with generally favourable reviews from critics, with an aggregate score of 72% on Metacritic. Axel & Pixel has been described by critics as \\"a charming and surreal trip.\\" The dream world, especially, was received with acclaim, with critics calling it \\"bizarre and beautiful,\\" \\"unique and charming\\" and \\"graceful and fresh.\\" The game was primarily criticised for its short length, as the story can be completed in roughly three hours. Eurogamer Italy stated that the game was \\"a charming and surreal trip into the world of imagination. Axel & Pixel lacks in longevity, but still remains an intriguing 'point and click' adventure, with wonderful settings, cute characters and a proven gameplay.\\" Axel & Pixel's short length, much like Braid, has been disregarded by some critics, stating that \\"the overall charm and beauty of the game outweigh the short duration [of the game], which can be completed in two to three hours, though the mini-games add large amounts of replay value.\\" Since its release, Axel & Pixel has sold over 21,000 copies worldwide on the Xbox 360.

At its peak, it had nine national editions, published in 13 major cities. Murphy was the grandson of the paper's founder, former slave and Civil War veteran John H. Murphy Sr. After working from 1937 as manager of the paper's Washington, D.C. edition, and in other positions, Murphy succeeded his uncle Carl J. Murphy in 1967 as president of the Afro-American papers, and in 1974 as chairman of the board and publisher. Life and career John Henry Murphy III was born on March 2, 1916 to Daniel H. Murphy and Sara Murphy Neely in Baltimore, Maryland. He was named for his father and grandfather; the latter had founded the Baltimore Afro-American at the end of the 19th century. After his parents separated, John moved with his mother to Philadelphia, where he graduated from Overbrook High School. He earned his bachelor's degree in business administration from Temple University in 1937. After graduation, Murphy joined the family newspaper business. He was assigned to work as office manager at the Washington Afro-American, based in the capital. Murphy worked in a variety of positions to learn the family newspaper business, which his uncle Carl J. Murphy expanded to 13 major cities at its peak during his 45 years of leadership. In 1967 Murphy III was named president of the Afro-American papers, succeeding his uncle. One of his innovations was a weekly supplement, Dawn magazine, which attracted advertising and addressed issues of interest to middle-class readers. The business still published a national edition and local versions in several East Coast and Southern cities. In 1974, Murphy became board chairman and publisher. Through these years, the business faced increasing competition for advertising dollars from television, and later the Internet. It has reduced the number of editions it publishes. In 1986, Murphy retired as chairman of the board of the newspaper company. Murphy was also a photographer, taking family pictures, as well as pictures for the Baltimore Times.

The majority of the Cherokee people wished to make peace with the Americans near the end of 1776 following several military setbacks and the reprisals that followed. The Chickamauga followers of headman Dragging Canoe moved with him down the Tennessee River away from their historic Overhill Cherokee towns in the winter of 1776‚Äì77. Relocated in a more isolated area, they established 11 new towns in order to gain distance from colonists' encroachments. The frontier Americans associated Dragging Canoe and his band with their new town on the Chickamauga Creek and began to refer to them as the Chickamaugas. Five years later, the Chickamaugas moved further west and southwest into present-day Alabama, establishing five larger settlements. They were then more commonly known as the Lower Cherokee. This term was closely associated with the people of these \\"Five Lower Towns\\". Migration=\\"Chickamauga\\" towns The original 'Chickamauga Towns' of Dragging Canoe's followers, along with the Hiwassee towns and the towns on the Tellico During the winter of 1776‚Äì77, Cherokee followers of Dragging Canoe, who had supported the British at the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War, moved down the Tennessee River and away from their historic Overhill Cherokee towns. They established nearly a dozen new towns in this frontier area in an attempt to gain distance from encroaching European-American settlers. Dragging Canoe and his followers settled at the place where the Great Indian Warpath crossed the Chickamauga Creek, near present-day Chattanooga, Tennessee. They named their town Chickamauga after the stream. The entire adjacent region was referred to in general as the Chickamauga area. American settlers adopted that term to refer to the militant Cherokee in this area as \\"Chickamaugas.\\" In 1782, militia forces under John Sevier and William Campbell destroyed the eleven Cherokee towns. Dragging Canoe once again led his people further down the Tennessee River, establishing five new, Lower Cherokee towns. After the Revolutionary War, westward migration increased by pioneers from the new states of Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia. \\"Five Lower Towns\\" Dragging Canoe relocated his people west and southwest, into new settlements centered on Running Water (now Whiteside) on Running Water Creek. The other towns founded at this time were: Nickajack (near the cave of the same name), Long Island (on the Tennessee River), Crow Town (at the mouth of Crow Creek), and Lookout Mountain Town (at the site of the current Trenton, Georgia). In time more towns spread south and west, and all these were referred to as the Lower Towns. Constant war The Chickamauga Cherokee became known for their uncompromising enmity against United States settlers, who had pushed them out of their traditional territory. From Running Water town, Dragging Canoe led attacks on white settlements all over the American Southeast. The Chickamauga/Lower Cherokee and the frontiersmen were continuously at war until 1794. Chickamauga warriors raided as far as Indiana, Kentucky, and Virginia (along with the Western Confederacy‚Äîwhich they helped establish). Because of a growing belief in the Chickamauga cause, as well as the destruction of the homes of the other Native Americans, a majority of the Cherokee eventually came to be allied against the United States. Following the death of Dragging Canoe in 1792, his hand-picked successor, John Watts, assumed control of the Lower Cherokee. Under Watts' lead, the Cherokee continued their policy of Indian unity and hostility toward European-Americans. Watts moved his base of operations to Willstown to be closer to his Muscogee allies. Before this, he had concluded a treaty in Pensacola with the Spanish governor of West Florida, Arturo O'Neill de Tyrone, for arms and supplies with which to carry on the war. Cherokee interactions The Chickamauga Towns and the later Lower Towns were no different from the rest of the Cherokee than were other groups of historic settlements, known as the Middle Towns, Out Towns, (original) Lower Towns, Valley Towns, or Overhill Towns, well established by the time the Europeans first encountered these people. The groupings did not constitute separate political entities as much as groupings for geographic convenience. The only real government among the Cherokee was by town and clan, and though there were regional councils, these had no binding powers. Over time, the different groups of towns developed differing ideas about relations with European-Americans, in part related to the degree of interaction and intermarriage they had with them through trading and other partnerships. The only \\"national\\" role which existed among Cherokee people before 1788 was First Beloved Man, which was a chief negotiator from the Towns of the Cherokee farthest from the reach of European settlers. After 1788, there was a national council of sorts, but it met irregularly and at the time had little authority. Even after the peace of 1794, the Cherokee were broken up into five groups: the Upper Towns (formerly the Lower Towns of western Carolina and northeastern Georgia), the Overhill Towns, the Hill Towns, the Valley Towns, and the (new) Lower Towns, each with their own regional ruling councils (considered more important than the \\"national\\" council at Ustanali). Dragging Canoe had addressed the National Council at Ustanali, and publicly acknowledged Little Turkey as the senior leader of all the Cherokee. He was memorialized by the council following his death in 1792. Leaders of the \\"Chickamauga\\" frequently communicated with the Cherokee of other regions, and they were supported in warfare against the colonists and later pioneers by warriors from the Overhill Towns. Numerous Chickamauga headmen signed treaties with the federal government, along with other leaders of Cherokee Nation. Aftermath of the wars Following the Treaty of Tellico Blockhouse in late 1794, leaders from the Lower Cherokee dominated national affairs of the people. When the national government of all the Cherokee Nation was organized, the first three persons to hold the office of Principal Chief of the Cherokee Nation were: Little Turkey (1788‚Äì1801), Black Fox (1801‚Äì1811), and Pathkiller (1811‚Äì1827)., These had all served as warriors under Dragging Canoe. Doublehead and Turtle-at- Home, the first two Speakers of the Cherokee National Council, had also served with Dragging Canoe. The domination of the Cherokee Nation by the former warriors from the Lower Towns continued well into the 19th century. Even after the revolt of the young chiefs of the Upper Towns, the representatives of the Lower Towns were a major voice. The \\"young chiefs\\" of the Upper Towns who dominated that region had also previously been warriors with Dragging Canoe and Watts. Resettling  Many of the former warriors returned to the original settlements in the Chickamauga area, some of which had already been reoccupied. They also established new towns in the area, plus several in north Georgia. Others moved into those towns established after the earlier migration. In 1799, Brother Steiner, a representative of the Moravian Brethren, met with Richard Fields at Tellico Blockhouse. Fields was a Lower Cherokee who had previously served as a warrior. Steiner hired him as guide and interpreter, as the missionary had been sent south by the Brethren to scout for an appropriate location for a mission and school in the Nation. It was ultimately located at Spring Place, on land donated by James Vann, who supported gaining some European-American education for his people. On one occasion, Steiner asked his guide, \\"What kind of people are the Chickamauga?\\" Fields laughed, then replied, \\"They are Cherokee, and we know no difference.\\"Allen, Penelope; \\"The Fields Settlement\\"; Penelope Allen Manuscript; Archive Section; Chattanooga-Hamilton County Bicentennial Library; Neither the Chickamauga nor other Cherokee considered them to be distinct from the overall 18th-century Cherokee peoples.Founders; government archives online; accessed December 2016 Still others joined the remnant populations of the Overhill towns on the Little Tennessee River that were referred to as the Upper Towns. These were centered on Ustanali in Georgia. Vann and his prot√©g√©s The Ridge and Charles R. Hicks rose to be their top leaders. The leaders of these towns were the most progressive among the Cherokee, favoring extensive acculturation, formal education adapted from European-Americans, and modern methods of farming.Wilkins, Thurman. Cherokee Tragedy: The Ridge Family and the Decimation of a People, pp. 33‚Äì47. (New York: Macmillan Company, 1970). The primary areas of operations during the Chickamauga Wars, showing the more prominent settlements of the war and postwar Lower Towns in the lower left quarter For a decade or more after the end of the hostilities, the northern section of the Upper Towns had their own council and acknowledged the top headman of the Overhill Towns as their leader. They gradually had to move south because they ceded their land to the United States. John McDonald returned to his old home on the Chickamauga River, across from Old Chickamauga Town, and lived there until selling it in 1816. It was purchased by the Boston-based American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions for use as the Brainerd Mission, which served as both a church (named the Baptist Church of Christ at Chickamauga) and a school offering academic and vocational training. His daughter, Mollie McDonald, and son-in-law, Daniel Ross, developed a farm and trading post near the old village of Chatanuga (Tsatanugi) from the early days of the wars. Settled near them were sons Lewis and Andrew Ross and a number of daughters. Their son John Ross, born at Turkey Town, later rose to become a principal chief, guiding the Cherokee through the Indian Removals of the 1830s and relocation to Indian Territory west of the Mississippi River. The majority of the Lower Cherokee remained in the towns they inhabited in 1794, known as the Lower Towns, with their seat at Willstown. The former warriors of the Lower Towns dominated the political affairs of the Nation for the next twenty years. They were more conservative than leaders of the Upper Towns, adopting many elements of assimilation but keeping as many of the old ways as possible. Roughly speaking, the Lower Towns were south and southwest of the Hiwassee River along the Tennessee down to the north border of the Muscogee nation, and west of the Conasauga and the Ustanali in Georgia, while the Upper Towns were north and east of the Hiwassee and between the Chattahoochee River and the Conasauga. This latter was approximately the same area as the later Amohee, Chickamauga, and Chattooga districts of the Cherokee Nation East.Wilkins (1970). Cherokee Tragedy, pg. 58. Also traditional were the settlements of the Cherokee in the highlands of western North Carolina, which had become known as the Hill Towns, with their seat at Quallatown. Similarly, the lowland Valley Towns, with their seat at Tuskquitee, were more traditional, as was the Upper Town of Etowah. It was notable both for being inhabited mostly by full-bloods (as many Cherokee of the other towns were of mixed race but identified as Cherokee) and for being the largest town in the Cherokee Nation. The Overhill towns remaining along the Little Tennessee remained more or less autonomous, and kept their seat at Chota. All five regions had their own councils. These were more important to their people than the nominal nation council until the reorganization in 1810, which took place after the national council held that year at Willstown. Peacetime leaders of the Lower Towns John Watts remained the head of the council of the Lower Cherokee at Willstown until his death in 1802. Afterward, Doublehead, already a member of the triumvirate, moved into that position and held it until his death in 1807. He was assassinated by The Ridge, Alexander Saunders (best friend to James Vann), and John Rogers. The latter was a white former trader who had first come west with Dragging Canoe in 1777. By 1802 he was considered a member of the nation, and was allowed to sit on the council. He was succeeded on the council by The Glass, who was also assistant principal chief of the nation to Black Fox. The Glass was head of the Lower Towns council until the unification council of 1810. The Ridge (Ganundalegi), formerly known as Pathkiller (Nunnehidihi), illustration from History of the Indian Tribes of North America. By the time John Norton (a Mohawk of Cherokee and Scottish ancestry) visited the area in 1809‚Äì1810, many of the formerly militant Cherokee of the Lower Towns were among the most assimilated members. James Vann, for instance, became a major planter, holding more than 100 African-American slaves, and was one of the wealthiest men east of the Mississippi. Norton became a personal friend of Turtle-at-Home as well as John Walker, Jr., and The Glass, all of whom were involved in business and commerce. At the time of Norton's visit, Turtle-at-Home owned a ferry with a landing on the Federal Road between Nashville, Tennessee and Athens, Georgia, where he lived at Nickajack. This community had expanded down the Tennessee as well as across it to the north, eclipsing Running Water. When Georgia and the US government increased pressure for the Cherokee Nation to cede its lands and remove to the west of the Mississippi River, such leaders of the Lower Towns as Tahlonteeskee, Degadoga, John Jolly, Richard Fields, John Brown, Bob McLemore, John Rogers, Young Dragging Canoe, George Guess (Tsiskwaya, or Sequoyah) and Tatsi (aka Captain Dutch) were forerunners. Believing that removal was inevitable in the face of settlers' greed, they wanted to try to get the best lands and settlements possible. They moved with followers to Arkansas Territory, establishing what later became known as the Cherokee Nation West. They next moved to Indian Territory following an 1828 treaty between their leaders and the US government. They were called the \\"Old Settlers\\" in Indian Territory and lived there nearly a decade before the remainder of the Cherokee were forced to join them. Likewise, the remaining leaders of the Lower Towns proved to be the strongest advocates of voluntary westward emigration, in which they were most bitterly opposed by those former warriors and their sons who led the Upper Towns. Ultimately such leaders as Major Ridge (as The Ridge had been known since his military service during the Creek and First Seminole Wars), his son John Ridge, his nephews Elias Boudinot and Stand Watie, came to believe that they needed to try to negotiate the best deal with the federal government, as they believed that removal would happen. Other emigration advocates were John Walker, Jr., David Vann, and Andrew Ross (brother of then Principal Chief John Ross). They agreed to the Treaty of New Echota in 1835, which resulted in the Cherokee removal in 1838‚Äì1839. Later events=Tecumseh's return In November 1811, Shawnee chief Tecumseh returned to the South hoping to gain the support of the southern tribes for his crusade to drive back the Americans and revive the old ways. He was accompanied by representatives from the Shawnee, Muscogee, Kickapoo, and Sioux peoples. Tecumseh's exhortations in the towns of the Chickasaw, Choctaw, and Lower Muscogee found no traction. He did attract some support from younger warriors of the Upper Muscogee. The Cherokee delegation under The Ridge who visited Tecumseh's council at Tuckabatchee strongly opposed his plans; Tecumseh cancelled his visit to the Cherokee Nation, as The Ridge threatened him with death if he went there. But, during his recruiting tour, Tecumseh was accompanied by an enthusiastic escort of 47 Cherokee and 19 Choctaw, who presumably went north with him when he returned to the \\"Northwest Territory.\\"Eckert, Allan W. A Sorrow in Our Heart: The Life of Tecumseh, pp. 655‚Äì665. (New York: Bantam, 1992)McLoughlin, William G. Cherokee Renascence in the New Republic, pp. 168‚Äì185. (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1992) War with the Creek Tecumseh's mission sparked a religious revival, referred to by anthropologist James Mooney as the \\"Cherokee Ghost Dance\\" movement.Mooney, James. The Ghost Dance Religion and the Sioux Outbreak of 1890, pp. 670‚Äì677. (Washington: Government Printing Office, 1896) It was led by the prophet Tsali of Coosawatee, a former Chickamauga warrior. He later moved to the western North Carolina mountains, where he was executed by U.S. forces in 1838 for violently resisting Removal. Tsali met with the national council at Ustanali, arguing for war against the Americans. He moved some leaders, until The Ridge spoke even more eloquently in rebuttal, calling instead for support of the Americans in the coming war with the British and Tecumseh's alliance. During the War of 1812, William McIntosh of the Lower Muscogee sought Cherokee help in the Creek War, to suppress the \\"Red Sticks\\" (Upper Muscogee). More than 500 Cherokee warriors served under Andrew Jackson in this effort, going against their former allies.McLoughlin (1992), Cherokee Renascence in the New Republic, ; pp. 186‚Äì205.Wilkins (1970), Cherokee Tragedy, pp. 52-80. A few years later, Major Ridge led a troop of Cherokee cavalry who were attached to the 1,400-strong contingent of Lower Muscogee warriors under McIntosh in the First Seminole War in Florida. They were allied with and accompanied a force of U.S. regular Army, Georgia militia, and Tennessee volunteers into Florida for action against the Seminoles, refugee Red Sticks, and escaped slaves fighting against the United States.Wilkins (1970), Cherokee Tragedy, pp. 114‚Äì115 Warriors from the Cherokee Nation East traveled to the lands of the Old Settlers (or Cherokee Nation West) in Arkansas Territory to assist them during the Cherokee-Osage War of 1817‚Äì1823, in which they fought against the Osage. Following the Seminole War, Cherokee warriors, with only one exception, did not take to the warpath in the Southeast again until the time of the American Civil War, when William Holland Thomas raised the Thomas Legion of Cherokee Indians and Highlanders in North Carolina to fight for the Confederacy. In 1830 the State of Georgia seized land in its south that had belonged to the Cherokee since the end of the Creek War, land separated from the rest of the Cherokee Nation by a large section of Georgia territory, and began to parcel it out to settlers. Major Ridge led a party of 30 south, where they drove the settlers out of their homes on what the Cherokee considered their land, and burned all buildings to the ground, but harmed no one.McLoughlin, William G., Cherokee Renascence in the New Republic, pp. 209‚Äì215.(Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1992).

Description Heroes of Olympus is a fantasy system set in the heroic age of ancient Greece. The player characters are Argonauts, adventurers in the crew of the hero Jason. The rules cover the backgrounds and abilities of the Argonauts, character improvement, combat (including rules for trickery), sailing, magic, nonhuman races, the gods, and how to run a campaign. The set comes with four scenarios (with a color map for each), including the Golden Fleece, and encounters with the Harpies and Clashing Rocks. Heroes of Olympus is based on Greek mythology and players either take on the roles of Argonauts in Jason's crew or else make their own heroes using point-based character creation. The game includes two tactical combat systems for melee and a naval combat system, and was an attempt to bring together elements from roleplaying games, board games and wargames. The 2nd edition adds some sample miniatures and an article from Different Worlds for adapting the characters to Thieves' World. Publication history Heroes of Olympus was written by B. Dennis Sustare, and published by Task Force Games in 1981. It was a boxed set with an orange cover, containing a 56-page book, five maps, two cardboard counter sheets, and dice. Heroes of Olympus was the first of a number of pseudo-RPGs that Task Force Games produced, of the sort that were also appearing at other wargaming companies such as SPI's DragonQuest and Metagaming Concepts's The Fantasy Trip. Heroes of Olyumpus was supported by a pair of magazine articles, and did earn a second edition in 1983. The second edition was a larger boxed set with a cover by Chris White, containing a 56-page book, a pamphlet, five maps, counters, metal miniatures, and dice. Reception According to Shannon Appelcline, although the game had elements of roleplaying games, board games and wargames, \\"it was probably as much of a roleplaying game as other RPGs from the same time period,\\" such as DragonQuest and The Fantasy Trip.

He proved the existence, for every positive h, of a finite Kh + 1-free graph which has a monocolored Kh in every 2-coloring of the edges, settling a problem previously posed by Paul Erd≈ës and Andr√°s Hajnal.. He further proved that if G is a finite graph such that every set S of vertices contains an independent set of size (S ‚àí k)/2 then the chromatic number of G is at most k + 2.J.

In convex geometry, Folkman worked with his RAND colleague Lloyd Shapley to prove the Shapley‚ÄìFolkman lemma and theorem: Their results suggest that sums of sets are approximately convex; in mathematical economics their results are used to explain why economies with many agents have approximate equilibria, despite individual nonconvexities.. In additive combinatorics, Folkman's theorem states that for each assignment of finitely many colors to the positive integers, there exist arbitrarily large sets of integers all of whose nonempty sums have the same color; the name was chosen as a memorial to Folkman by his friends.Page 81 in .

To restore Folkman's confidence, Erd≈ës immediately challenged him to solve mathematical problems. In the late 1960s, Folkman suffered from brain cancer; while hospitalized, Folkman was visited repeatedly by Ronald Graham and Paul Erd≈ës. After his brain surgery, Folkman was despairing that he had lost his mathematical skills. As soon as Folkman received Graham and Erd≈ës at the hospital, Erd≈ës challenged Folkman with mathematical problems, helping to rebuild his confidence. Folkman later purchased a gun and killed himself. Folkman's supervisor at RAND, Delbert Ray Fulkerson, blamed himself for failing to notice suicidal behaviors in Folkman. Several years later Fulkerson also killed himself..

In computing, the term was initially synonymous with software protection dongles‚Äîa form of hardware digital rights management where a piece of software will only operate if a specified dongle‚Äîwhich typically contains a license key or some other cryptographic protection mechanism‚Äîis plugged into the computer while it is running. The term has since been applied to other forms of devices with a similar form factor, such as adapters that convert ports to handle different types of connectors (such as DVI to VGA for displays, USB to serial connection, and in modern computing, USB-C to other types of ports, and Mobile High-Definition Link), USB wireless adapters for standards such as Bluetooth and Wi-Fi (the term \\"stick\\" or \\"key\\" is more commonly used to describe USB flash drives, as well as modern forms of dongles with slimmer form factors more akin to flash drives), and small form-factor digital media players that plug into HDMI ports.  Etymology  A parallel port dongle. There are varying accounts on the etymology of the word \\"dongle\\"; in a 1999 paper, P. B. Schneck stated that the origin was unclear, but that it was possibly a corruption of the word \\"dangle\\" (since these devices \\"dangle\\" from a port on a PC). A 1992 Byte magazine advertisement by Rainbow Technologies claimed that dongles were invented by and named after a person named \\"Don Gall\\", which spawned an urban legend. Linguist Ben Zimmer noted that the claim was likely a by-product of their \\"tongue-in-cheek\\" marketing style, and \\"was so egregiously false that the company happily owned up to it as a marketing ploy when pressed by Eric S. Raymond, who maintains the Jargon File, an online lexicon of hacker slang.\\" Examples=Copy protection Security dongles are typically used to help prevent unauthorized use and copying of certain forms of software. Initially using ports such as the serial port or parallel port, most are now in USB format. On the other hand, some unlicensed game cartridges have a \\"daisy chain\\" design that allows licensed games to pass along their authorization, for instance to circumvent the 10NES chip on the Nintendo Entertainment System. Small peripheral appliances A Chromecast plugged into the HDMI port of a TV. The wire attached to the other end is the USB power supply. In the mid-to-late 2010s, the dongle form factor was extended to digital media players with a small, stick-like form factor ‚Äî such as Chromecast and Fire TV Stick ‚Äî that are designed to plug directly into an HDMI port on a television or AV receiver (powered via Micro USB connection to the television itself or an AC adapter), in contrast to a larger set-top box-style device. Single-board computers, such as the Intel Compute Stick, have also been produced in a similar means. Adapters *Very short cables that connect relatively large jacks to smaller plugs allow cables to be easily installed and removed from equipment with limited space available for connectors. The Chromecast device comes with a short HDMI extension cable to allow its use in cramped quarters. Some devices come with a permanently attached length of cable that negates the need for a short adapter cable.

He is also one of only two Division I players ever to record 11 or more steals in two separate games. The first occurrence was on January 24, 1986 against McKendree University, and the second time happened two weeks later on February 8 against Saint Xavier University. Brittman recorded 11 steals in each game. Brittman grew up in Chicago, Illinois and attended Chicago Vocational Career Academy. When he played college basketball for Chicago State University, the school was not classified as Division I until his senior year in 1985‚Äì86, so even though he led the nation in steals per game as a junior, the statistic is not recognized as a Division I accomplishment. Brittman was a point guard, and it was his small stature that ultimately cost him a chance to play in the NBA despite high acclaim from his coaches, NBA scouts and other NBA players. He was cut from the Milwaukee Bucks' training camp in 1986 because he was playing behind highly touted point guard Scott Skiles.

Personal life Gare was born Doris Violet May Wadham in 1919 in Adelaide, South Australia. Her parents John Henry Wadham, a saddler and harness maker, and Mary Hounslow Wadham, were strict Methodists. Gare attended Adelaide School of Art and then Perth Technical College, returning to Adelaide to work as a typist from 1938 to 1939. In 1941, she married Perth-based public servant Frank Ellis Gare, who then left to serve on the Queen Mary during World War II. Nene and Frank Gare had four children, Arran (1942‚Äì47), Leif Frances (b 1945), Arran Gare (b 1948) and Helen Shelley Gare (b 1952). From 1946 to 1948, the family moved to Papua New Guinea, where Frank worked as a patrol officer on Duke of York Island, at Salamaua and Mumeng. Many of her experiences in PNG formed the basis of the novel \\"An Island Away\\". In 1947, at the age of four, her oldest son Arran died of malaria, while her two-year-old daughter Leif survived the disease. The family returned to Perth, where Frank worked as a clerk. The couple's third child was born in 1948 and named Arran in honour of the son they had lost. Nene suffered a persistent cough so the family moved to Carnarvon in the northwest of Western Australia, where they managed a banana plantation and where their fourth child, daughter Helen, was born. Gare's novel \\"Green Gold\\" is based on this period. In 1952-54, Frank was appointed District Officer with the Native Welfare Department in Carnarvon and was transferred to the position of District Officer for the Murchison Region, with the family based in Geraldton. Using modest government funding, Frank Gare was charged with meeting basic needs (ablutions, water, shelter and power) in Aboriginal reserves throughout the area. Nene and the children often stayed at a semi-rural property at Drummond Cove. Nene came to know several Aboriginal families living in a camp known as the Snake Pit, a collection of tin and hessian shacks with dirt floors and no running water or electricity, just outside Geraldton, with these friendships later inspiring The Fringe Dwellers. Gare later said that she was influenced by the relative penury of her own parents in comparison to her extended family of wealthier aunts and uncles. Her books \\"A House with Verandahs\\" and \\"Kent Town\\" draw on this period. Gare told editor Christobel Mattingley that because she felt second-class, and was affected by family hardships during the Depression, she had empathy for the Aboriginal people in Western Australia, on whom her most famous novel was based. Gare was quoted by Christobel Mattingley as explaining, \\"I have always written about my own experiences. I write as I feel. I have been too afraid to write from my imagination in case I mislead. My own reading when I was very young caused me to expect so much more from life than one ever gets. So I distrust most fiction. I'd never never contrive to make a plot. Things must happen, as I think they do. No working up to a climax - possibly unfortunately for my publishers\\". Art Gare was a talented artist and held five exhibitions in Perth. She won prizes in the Canning Art Awards for 1971, 1972, 1976 and 1978. She donated most of the proceeds from her art to charities, including Amnesty International, WA AIDS Council, the local dogs' home and a woman lawyer assisting Aboriginal women and children.

The gallery preserves and presents to the public the most significant works of Me≈°troviƒá, and is in itself an art monument. The permanent collection includes works of sculpture, drawings, design, furniture and architecture. Holdings include original plaster models by the artist, as well as finished works in bronze, marble and wood. The gallery building and grounds were based on original plans by Me≈°troviƒá himself, and included living and working areas, as well as exhibition spaces. Not far from the gallery lies Ka≈°telet-Crikvine, a restored chapel that houses a set of wooden wall panels carved by Ivan Me≈°troviƒá. History Ivan Me≈°troviƒá bought a piece of land on the Marjan peninsula west of Split in the 1920s, where he intended to build a summer home. The villa was built between 1931 and 1939 to an original design by Me≈°troviƒá himself, and he was involved right though its construction. The architects Harold Biliniƒá and Lavoslav Horvat developed the plans, and builder Marin Marasoviƒá was in charge of construction. The building and its grounds overlooking the Adriatic Sea were designed to fulfill three purposes: as a family home, working studio and exhibit space. The Me≈°troviƒá family stayed in the villa from the summer of 1932 until 1941, when Me≈°troviƒá left for Zagreb. Letters from that time are in the archives of the gallery. In 1952, Ivan Me≈°troviƒá donated the property, along with three others, and 132 of his art works to the state, making possible the founding of the Ivan Me≈°troviƒá Gallery. Initially administered by the Conservation Institute for Dalmatia, in 1955 it was placed under the Culture and Education Department of the City of Split. Since 1991, the gallery has been an integral part of the Ivan Me≈°troviƒá Foundation with its headquarters in Zagreb, and which now administers all four donated properties. The gallery's mission, as defined in the first Statute (6 May 1958) are the \\"protection, collection, expert and scholarly treatment and presentation of the museum holdings and popularization of Ivan Me≈°troviƒá's works and name\\". The initial gallery holdings contained 70 sculptures, specifically listed by the artist and selected to be placed in the museum of his works in Split and in the nearby Ka≈°telet-Crikvine complex. In time, those holdings grew through purchases, exchanges, casting in bronze and stone sculptures from plaster models, and further donations from the artist himself, his heirs, and other donors. The gallery was closed for the public for many years, partly due to its rather dilapidated condition, but also due to the Croatian War of Independence in the 1990s. After an extensive renovation, the new permanent display was opened on 18 May 1998. The gallery exhibits most of the sculptor's works within its permanent display, but in addition, the building itself is an artistic monument. Ivan Me≈°troviƒá had planned the villa primarily as a family home and working studio, so the conversion into a complete museum space required some modification, while still retaining the original character of the halls and rooms. Collection The gallery's holdings today contain 192 sculptures, 583 drawings, 4 paintings, 291 architectural plans (almost entirely made by Ivan Me≈°troviƒá and dating between 1898 and 1961), and 2 furniture sets, one of which is made according to Me≈°troviƒá's sketches and is a part of the new permanent display in the former dining room. The Ivan Me≈°troviƒá Gallery also houses 168 works of art owned by Ivan Me≈°troviƒá's heirs. Exhibition The permanent exhibition covers two floors of the building, and an outdoor sculpture park. The work is arranged by theme, rather than chronological order, and displayed in a manner consistent with the exhibition space. On the ground floor, the central hall provides a striking entrance with large, mainly marble statues corresponding with the stone fa√ßade, in a formal arrangement. The dining room on the west side retains the authentic character of the artist's home with Me≈°troviƒá's furniture, paintings, and bronze portraits of the family members. The exhibition hall on the east side is dedicated to religious works, a recurring theme in Me≈°troviƒá‚Äôs art. Upstairs, the west wing hall is dedicated to early Me≈°troviƒá works from the secession period, while the east hall displays sculptures made mostly between the two World Wars. A special side room is dedicated to the theme of Job. The large central hall houses sculpture, and is also used for special events. The first floor display also includes drawings by Me≈°troviƒá. In total, the gallery houses 86 sculptures and reliefs in marble, bronze, or wood, 3 oil paintings, and 15 drawings. A further 8 bronze sculptures are exhibited in the park in front of the building, and 2 sculptures and 28 wooden reliefs are displayed in nearby Ka≈°telet-Crikvine.

College In 2008, as a true freshman, LeGrand made his collegiate debut against the North Carolina Tar Heels on September 11. He saw action on special teams. By 2009, coach Greg Schiano decided to channel LeGrand's strength and speed at a new position, defensive lineman. LeGrand earned himself the backup defensive tackle position to Charlie Noonan, but he managed to appear in all thirteen games that season, racking up 33 tackles. Schiano saw him as a multipurpose player, and LeGrand proved himself to be with 13 tackles on kickoff coverage in his sophomore season. LeGrand recorded a tackle for loss in seven games, and played eleven games where he had multiple sacks. He went on to tie his career-high four tackles against the Maryland Terrapins. LeGrand added three solo tackles, including a tackle-for- loss against West Virginia on December 5 and at Syracuse on November 21. Eric posted three tackles versus South Florida on November 12 and matched his career high four tackles and had 1 tackles for loss along with a fumble recovery against Pittsburgh on October 16 and three tackles and an assisted tackle for loss against Howard on September 12.Bio In 2010, LeGrand's junior season, he proved to be a crucial performer at defensive tackle in the first six games before suffering a career-ending spinal cord injury. He had his season-high three tackles and a tackle for loss against Tulane on October 2. On September 2 versus Norfolk State, LeGrand proved useful to the team defense; posting up a pair of tackles including a tackle for loss and a fumble recovery. He added two tackles at FIU on September 11, and assisted on a sack against North Carolina on September 25. On October 16 in a game against the Army Black Knights at MetLife Stadium, he suffered an injury in the fourth quarter during a collision with Army's kickoff returner, Malcom Brown, ending the defensive tackle's season with 13 tackles including two sacks. Injury On October 16, 2010, LeGrand suffered a severe spinal cord injury during a game against Army in East Rutherford, New Jersey, at MetLife Stadium. On a kickoff to Army, LeGrand unintentionally put his head down while running and ended up driving the crown of his head into the shoulder of the ball carrier, Malcolm Brown. LeGrand was credited with the tackle, but he lay on the ground for several minutes before being carted off, unable to move anything but his head and unable to breathe. As the gurney rolled off the field at MetLife Stadium, LeGrand tried to force a thumbs up to the crowd but was unable to perform the gesture, saying \\"it felt like a thousand pound cinder block was holding me down\\". He was taken to the intensive care unit of the Hackensack University Medical Center, in Hackensack, New Jersey, where doctors determined that LeGrand was paralyzed from the neck down. He fractured his C3 and C4 cervical vertebrae. About two weeks later, he was transferred to Kessler Institute for Rehabilitation, one of the US's leaders in spinal cord rehabilitation. LeGrand was put on a respirator right away to help him breathe, and doctors informed his mother that he would more than likely need the aid of the machine to continue breathing for the rest of his life. Doctors also informed Karen LeGrand that her son had a suspected 0‚Äì5% chance of walking for the rest of his life. The next day when LeGrand woke up, he managed to mouth the words \\"I'll be back\\" to his mother. Recovery LeGrand wanted to breathe at his own pace, and asked doctors to take him off of his ventilator on Thanksgiving of 2010. He stated; \\"it's not even whether you keep breathing, it's whether you keep breathing how you want to breathe.\\" A month later LeGrand had lasted an hour and a half off of his ventilator. LeGrand proceeded to practice breathing without the use of medical equipment, and was independently breathing by January 2011. Coach Greg Schiano would visit LeGrand frequently, and is said to have truly embraced the entire family as his own, and would repeatedly relieve Eric's mother from taking care of him without hesitation. On January 6, Rutgers announced that LeGrand had regained movement in his shoulders and sensation throughout his body. On October 29, Eric LeGrand returned with his teammates, for a Rutgers home game against West Virginia during a snow storm. LeGrand's return to High Point Solutions Stadium was said to be the most indelible moment of the year and was the awarded Sports Illustrated Fans Choice Best Moment of 2011. By Summer 2011, LeGrand took his story more public by posting pictures of himself on his Twitter account, in July, standing straight up, with the help of a specialized metal frame, and announcing that he was slowly regaining movement and sensation in his arms. Overnight, LeGrand gained 12,000 new followers. In 2012, thinking his story was fairly well-known, LeGrand jokingly sent a Tweet to Lolo Jones, challenging her to a race. All she knew of him was that he was a former football player and responded that, as a track star, she would win convincingly. When she was made aware of her unintended insult, she issued an apology for her response which was accepted by LeGrand. On May 14, 2014, she and LeGrand participated in a race called the Wings For Life World Run, held around the world, with proceeds going towards funding dedicated to spinal cord injury research. A fund named \\"bELieve\\" has been set up by the Rutgers Scarlet Knight family with proceeds going to Eric LeGrand and his family. The \\"bELieve\\" foundation has raised proceeds through selling sporting apparel stitched with LeGrand's name and number (52) as well as hosting numerous sporting events in LeGrand's honor. Professional career LeGrand resumed his studies via Skype for the Spring 2011 semester and made multiple appearances at spring football practices. At the Scarlet-White spring game, he expressed his aspiration of becoming a sports broadcaster, and he has continued to become an inspirational speaker nationwide. The Tampa Bay Buccaneers symbolically signed LeGrand on May 2, 2012. The Buccaneers were coached by Greg Schiano, who was the Rutgers head coach during LeGrand's playing career. Schiano agreed to become the head coach of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on January 26, 2012. LeGrand officially announced his retirement from football on July 26, 2012 to free up a roster spot for the team. Since the beginning of the 2012 NFL season the rules towards kickoffs have changed, and from now on kickoffs will take place from the 35-yard line, instead of the 30-yard line, in hopes of reducing the number of injuries. LeGrand believes that the rule should return to its previous incarnation, and argues that many football players can make a career out of playing on special teams, and that the new system deprives teams and players of some of the thrill and excitement of the game. Subway has added LeGrand to their roster of star athlete promoters. The Associated Press reported that LeGrand, alongside Justin Tuck of the New York Giants appeared in commercials together throughout the 2012 season. LeGrand joined a team of Subway-sponsored athletes including Olympic gold medalists Michael Phelps and Apolo Anton Ohno. Tom Pace of Subway's marketing office stated that; \\"We believe his inspirational story resonates with our fans. All of our athletes who know Eric are already rooting for him. Like us, they love his character, determination and positive outlook.\\" From 2016‚Äì2017, LeGrand hosted his own six episode mini web series Mission Possible with Eric LeGrand which was produced by the Mission Possible Group. Peter Berg, Doug Ellin, and Teri Weinberg are Executive Producers on the series which launched digitally on FoxSports. The series featured stories of six individuals living life in the face of adversity. The episodes included appearances by: Tom Brady, Bill Belichick, Drew Brees, Sean Payton, Dwayne Johnson, Justin Thomas, Michael Strahan, Frank Lampard, and Triple H. LeGrand made appearances promoting the series on Good Morning America, Fox NFL Sunday, First Things First, The Seth Davis Show, CBS This Morning, and Good Morning Football. Honors and awards In June 2012, LeGrand was presented the Unsung Hero Award by the New Jersey Hall of Fame. He was presented the Jimmy V Award for Perseverance at the 20th annual ESPYs on July 11, 2012. During his speech, he announced that he would someday walk again. The Jimmy V Award recognizes LeGrand for overcoming great obstacles through physical perseverance and determination, and for living by the Jimmy V 'Don't ever give up!' motto.‚Ä¢ http://www.buccaneers.com/news/article-1/Eric-LeGrand-to-Receive-Jimmy-V- Award-Wednesday-Night/023711d1-a1ce-407c-b96b-295331ddd2d6 LeGrand is a living epitome of the award‚Äôs motto and proves to be a worthy addition to the men and women who have previously received the award. That group includes NCAA wrestling champion, Anthony Robles, who was born with only a right leg; Northern State coach Don Meyer, who beat cancer and devastating injuries from a car crash and went on to set the men's college basketball record for most career victories; and Kevin Everett, the former Buffalo Bills tight end who suffered an injury similar to LeGrand's in a 2007 game. In August 2012, LeGrand was named the most influential person in New Jersey sports by the Star Ledger. The Eric LeGrand Patriot Saint Foundation is dedicated to helping those with spinal cord injuries. Nike presented their Eric Legrand Foundation Game jersey for Tampa Bay fans who want to show their support and spirit for Eric LeGrand on his long road to recovery. All of the proceeds of Eric LeGrand's number 52 jersey which are on sale in the team shop go to this foundation. His jersey will remain on sale regardless of LeGrand's team status, for now, LeGrand's role is to provide inspiration for his teammates and others.Tampa Bay Buccaneers Jerseys, Buccaneers Nike Jersey, Bucs Replica, Throwback, Uniforms - Official Store The Rutgers Division of Intercollegiate Athletics announced the establishment of the \\"Eric LeGrand Believe Fund\\" to support Eric LeGrand and his family.Eric LeGrand Believe Fund The Believe Fund's goal was/is to raise money to support the paralyzed player as he undergoes medical treatment for the injury he suffered against Army. The money will be used as the LeGrand family sees fit. On July 30, 2013, it was announced that Rutgers will be retiring the No. 52 jersey worn by LeGrand. The ceremony occurred on September 14, 2013, at halftime of the Rutgers-Eastern Michigan game. It was the first number to be retired by Rutgers in the 144-year history of their program. It has been stated by Rutgers and Eric that when he is able to walk onto the field again, they will unretire the #52 and put it back into rotation for a worthy player.CBS Television College Football Broadcast, Alabama at Texas A&M;, September 14, 2013 On May 18, 2014, LeGrand received a degree in labor relations from Rutgers and was asked to speak to his fellow graduates at Rutgers' spring commencement exercises. On October 16, 2016 (the sixth anniversary of his spinal cord injury), Avenel, NJ's former \\"Fifth District Park\\" was rededicated in LeGrand's honor as \\"Eric LeGrand 'Believe' Park\\". The park is slated to be fully redesigned and updated with handicap-accessible playground equipment. On March 13, 2017, professional wrestling and media company WWE announced that LeGrand would receive the Warrior Award at the WWE Hall of Fame ceremony on March 31, 2017. Since its introduction in 2015, the Warrior Award is given to \\"an individual who has exhibited unwavering strength and perseverance, and who lives life with the courage and compassion that embodies the indomitable spirit of Ultimate Warrior\\". Books In both The Victorious Story of Eric LeGrand (Young Readers' Edition) and Believe: My Faith and the Tackle That Changed My Life, Eric tells the story of how he is rebuilding his life, continuing his education, and pursuing a career in sports broadcasting. The book was published by HarperCollins in September 2012. Family LeGrand's mother is Karen LeGrand. He has a sister named Nicole LeGrand Harrigan, and his grandmother is Betty LeGrand.

The Darlings were often compared with the International Sweethearts of Rhythm, another African American all-girl swing band. The Darlings were darker skinned than the Sweethearts. Toby Butler, a white member of the International Sweethearts of Rhythm, was rumored to have left the band and joined the Darlings in the mid-1940s, when racial segregation made playing in mixed bands illegal. This rumor was confirmed in 1946 when she was arrested while performing in Georgia. Band members Members of the Darlings changed over time, and included the following: History The Darlings were formed in 1943 in Harlem by African American tenor and baritone saxophonist Lorraine Brown. Several of the band members joined the Darlings after leaving other bands. Gaddison and Vi Wilson joined the Darlings after leaving the International Sweethearts of Rhythm. Wilson joined the group to be with her cousin, reeds player Gurthalee Clark. Trombonist Jessie Turner and tenor saxophonist Margaret Backstrom left Eddie Durham's All Star Girl Orchestra for the Darlings. In 1945, drummer Hettie Smith replaced Henrietta Fontaine.

He was born on April 28, 1968, and was raised in Union, New Jersey. He is the son of soccer coach and player Manfred \\"Manny\\" Schellschedit. Karl attended Roselle Catholic High School and graduated in 1986. Soccer In the fall of 1986, Karl began attending Princeton University and while there he played soccer for the Princeton Tigers. Karl was a letter winner from the 1986 through the 1989 seasons. In 1986 Karl received honorable mention from the All-Ivy League, in 1988 he made the All-Ivy League Second Team and in 1989 he made the All-Ivy League First Team. In 1989 Karl was awarded The David S. Hackett Memorial Soccer Cup (MVP) which is awarded annually to the member of the Princeton soccer team whose enthusiasm, discipline and leadership contributed most to the team and the sport of soccer at Princeton. He was also the co-captain of the men's soccer team in 1988 and 1989. After graduating Princeton University with a BSE in Civil Engineering, Karl decided that he did not want to be an engineer. Instead he went to Germany where he played semi- professional soccer. A serious injury to his left heel forced Schellscheidt to quit playing soccer in Germany. During the summer of 1994 when the United States hosted the World Cup of soccer, Karl enjoyed a brief stint as a liaison for the German team, as Karl speaks German. Of his experience as a team liaison he stated \\"That was a great month of my life.\\" In 1994 when Schellscheidt went to teach math at the Hun School in Princeton, he was also the assistant soccer coach. Karl played the part of a soccer referee in the 2007 Davis Guggenheim film Gracie. The film is about a teenage girl in the late 1970s who tries out and plays for the varsity all-boy soccer team at her local high school. The film takes place in Karl's home state of New Jersey, and is loosely based on the childhood experiences of actress Elisabeth Shue. Educator and entrepreneur In 1993 Karl graduated from Seton Hall University with a Master's Degree in Secondary Education. After graduating graduate school Karl served as an Environmental Science Instructor for the Office of Continuing Education at Rutgers University. During his time there, Schellscheidt had the opportunity to work with troubled youth who had already run afoul of the law and had been turned off by public schools. In 1994 Schellscheidt began teaching math at the Hun School of Princeton, which he did for the next three years. Looking for more of an intellectual challenge, Karl enrolled in the University of Pennsylvania Law School and graduated in 2000. Until 2002 Karl worked as a lawyer for the prestigious law firm Dechert LLP, but he found the demands of corporate law to be incompatible with spending time with his family and tutoring so he decided to return to educating and tutoring while also doing some legal work. The flexibility worked well with his family life. In 2005 Karl founded ePrep along with fellow Princeton University graduate Eric Barnes. While surveying the current landscape for test prep services, Karl focused in on a critical discovery - that the traditional test prep market had become stagnant, complacent and mechanical in its approach to teaching over the past twenty years. Aside from being the co- founder of ePrep, Karl is also the President and CEO.

Fleeger, 36 U.S. (11 Pet.) 185 (1837), is a 7-to-0 ruling by the Supreme Court of the United States which held that the states of Kentucky and Tennessee had properly entered into an agreement establishing a mutual border between the two states. The plaintiffs in the case were granted title to property improperly conveyed by the state of Tennessee north of this border. In the ruling, the Supreme Court asserted the fundamental right of states and nations to establish their borders regardless of private contract, and made a fundamental statement about the rights of parties to object to a trial court ruling under the rules of civil procedure. Background In 1606, during European colonization of the Americas, James I of England granted the Charter of 1606 to the newly established Virginia Company, asserting royal title to Native American-occupied land between the 34th and 45th latitudes and inland, and permitting the Virginia Company to establish colonies there.Hubbard, American Boundaries: The Nation, the States, the Rectangular Survey, 2009, p. 7-9. In 1609, James I redefined the Colony of Virginia's boundaries to extend the colony's northern and southern boundaries as well as asserting title to all land west to the Pacific Ocean.Hubbard, American Boundaries: The Nation, the States, the Rectangular Survey, 2009, p. 10. In 1632, Charles I of England took the Colony of Virginia's grant north of the Potomac River away from Virginia and gave it to the new colony known as the Province of Maryland.Hubbard, American Boundaries: The Nation, the States, the Rectangular Survey, 2009, p. 22-23. Subsequent negotiations between the Province of Pennsylvania colony and Colony of Virginia further established the Virginia colony's northwestern border.Hubbard, American Boundaries: The Nation, the States, the Rectangular Survey, 2009, p. 28-29, 34. In 1629, Charles I also granted Sir Robert Heath a charter giving him title to Native American- occupied land from the northern boundary of what is modern-day Florida north to Albemarle Sound (31st latitude), extending from the Atlantic Ocean west to the Pacific Ocean.Chiorazzi and Most, Prestatehood Legal Materials: A Fifty- State Research Guide, Including New York City and the District of Columbia, 2006, p. 840. In 1663, Charles II of England revoked the Heath charter and issued a new charter to eight English noblemen (the \\"Lords and Proprietors\\"). In 1665, this charter was amended to extend the land grant northward roughly to the current border between North Carolina and Virginia.Chiorazzi and Most, Prestatehood Legal Materials: A Fifty-State Research Guide, Including New York City and the District of Columbia, 2006, p. 840-841. In 1729, the Proprietors were forced to turn their charters over to George II of Great Britain, and North Carolina was separated from South Carolina.Chiorazzi and Most, Prestatehood Legal Materials: A Fifty-State Research Guide, Including New York City and the District of Columbia, 2006, p. 841. Conflicting land claims as well as claims that land grants extended to the Pacific Ocean proved highly contentious issues after the American Revolution. To help resolve the issue, in 1781 Virginia agreed to surrender to the United States federal government all title to its land claims west of the Ohio River.Ayers, Gould, Oshinsky, and Soderland, American Passages: A History of the United States, 2009, p. 174. Titled was transferred in 1784, and the United States Congress passed the Land Ordinance of 1784, Land Ordinance of 1785, and the Northwest Ordinance to turn these lands into territories and (eventually) states.Miller, Native America, Discovered and Conquered: Thomas Jefferson, Lewis & Clark, and Manifest Destiny, 2006, p. 62. North Carolina officials fought for six years over the issue of cession, but in 1790 agreed to transfer title of its western lands to the United States as well.Bergeron, Paths of Past: Tennessee, 1770‚Äì1970, 1979, p. 18-19. Congress subsequently created the Southwest Territory (which encompassed the modern boundaries of the state of Tennessee) out of the ceded lands.Bergeron, Paths of Past: Tennessee, 1770‚Äì1970, 1979, p. 48. In 1792, after 10 constitutional conventions and three statehood enabling acts passed by the Virginia legislature, Kentucky was admitted as a state on June 1, 1792.Harrison, Kentucky's Road to Statehood, 1992, p. 19-90 Tennessee was admitted as a state on June 1, 1796.Bergeron, Paths of Past: Tennessee, 1770‚Äì1970, 1979, p. 26. However, Kentucky's borders were only vaguely described at points, and determination of the final border still remained when Kentucky joined the union.Harrison and Klotter, A History of Kentucky, 1997, p. 20. In 1779‚Äì1780, Kentucky's southern border was surveyed and ascertained westward to the Tennessee River. The \\"Walker line\\" tended slightly to the north and did not run truly westward along 36 degrees, 30 minutes north (which was the actual border, also called the \\"Mathews line\\"). Complicating matters, in 1818 Andrew Jackson and Isaac Shelby purchased from the Chickasaw Indian tribe.Harrison and Klotter, A History of Kentucky, 1997, p. 20-21. Known as the \\"Jackson Purchase,\\" the purchase's southern border (with Tennessee) ran along the Mathews line.Harrison and Klotter, A History of Kentucky, 1997, p. 21. Although the Walker line was extended to the Ohio River (which formed the Purchase's western boundary), it was called the \\"Munsell line\\" (or \\"Alexander and Munsell line\\") on the western side of the Tennessee River and formed the new border with Tennessee. Kentucky and Tennessee agreed in the Compact of 1820 to accept the Mathews line to the Tennessee River, and from that point it should follow the Munsell line.Garrett, History of the South Carolina Cession, and the Northern Boundary of Tennessee, 1884, p. 26-28. However, between 1786 and 1795, North Carolina had given title to much land in the disputed area to American Revolutionary War veterans in compensation for their services.Poole v. Fleeger, 36 U.S. 185. Tennessee had also granted land in the area to military veterans between 1809 and 1814. In 1832, John Fleeger and others sued, seeking title to of land in Montgomery County, Tennessee which lay south of the Walker line and north of the Mathews line.Poole v. Fleeger, 36 U.S. 185, 186. Fleeger and the other plaintiffs were the heirs of Frederick Rohrer, whose will (registered in the state of Pennsylvania) they claimed gave them title to the land. Poole and the other defendants were the heirs of John Montgomery, a Virginia military veteran who had claimed the land after being given title to it by the state of Virginia in 1784. A United States district court held that, under the Compact of 1820, Poole and the other plaintiffs were entitled to the land in question. Decision Associate Justice Joseph Story delivered the unanimous opinion of the Court. Story noted that Article 6 of the Compact of 1820 specifically protected land titles held by veterans and their heirs and assigns, while vacant land east of the Tennessee River and north of the Walker line would be the property of Kentucky and disposable by it.Poole v. Fleeger, 36 U.S. 185, 208‚Äì209. He then asserted in powerful language the right of the states of Kentucky and Tennessee to establish their borders as they wished:Poole v. Fleeger, 36 U.S. 185, 209. :It cannot be doubted that it is a part of the general right of sovereignty belonging to independent nations to establish and fix the disputed boundaries between their respective territories, and the boundaries so established and fixed by compact between nations become conclusive upon all the subjects and citizens thereof, and bind their rights and are to be treated, to all intents and purposes as the true and real boundaries. This is a doctrine universally recognized in the law and practice of nations. Story therefore refused to upset the Compact of 1820.Poole v. Fleeger, 36 U.S. 185, 209‚Äì210. The Compact of 1820 specifically upset any land titles granted by North Carolina or Tennessee north of latitude 36 degrees, 30 minutes north as improperly granted, Story affirmed.Poole v. Fleeger, 36 U.S. 185, 210. The defendants had argued that the Compact of 1820 violated the Contract Clause of the United States Constitution, which barred any state from passing \\"any Bill of Attainder, ex post facto Law, or Law impairing the Obligation of Contracts,...\\" But Story concluded that the Contract Clause did not apply here. The right of a state to set its borders was paramount (albeit subject to Congress' authority to admit states to the union), and the improper establishment of that boundary according to the Walker line created a defect in the contract which could not survive scrutiny.Poole v. Fleeger, 36 U.S. 185, 210‚Äì211. Justice Story also addressed an issue of court procedure raised by the defendants. At trial, the defendants had argued that Rohrer's will had not been properly registered in Tennessee and thus did not govern the land title in Tennessee, and that the will had not been so registered until after the plaintiffs' suit had already begun. The trial court had overruled these objections. The plaintiffs had taken no exception to the trial court's ruling, and had not stated their right to reserve an exception. Did this create grounds for an appeal? Story concluded it did not. In a major statement about civil procedure, he wrote, \\"In the ordinary course of things at the trial, if an objection is made and overruled as to the admission of evidence and the party does not take any exception at the trial, he is understood to waive it.\\"Poole v. Fleeger, 36 U.S. 185, 211. But even if the plaintiffs had managed to retain their right to object to the trial court's ruling, Story concluded, it did not matter when the will was registered in Tennessee. In a major statement on probate, Story concluded that if registration is correctly made, the time of the registration is immaterial. The defendants at trial had also argued that the plaintiffs were attempting to seek title to the land through tenancy in common, but that a tenant in common cannot recover on a joint demise (which the plaintiffs were seeking). The trial court had overruled this objection, and once again the defendants had not taken exception to the trial court's ruling. Story reiterated his fundamental rule of civil procedure: \\"The party not taking any exception, and acquiescing in the intimation of the court, must be understood to waive the point as a matter of error and to insist upon it only as a matter for a new trial.\\"Poole v. Fleeger, 36 U.S. 185, 212. The judgment of the trial court was affirmed. ReferencesBibliography *Ayers, Edward L.; Gould, Lewis L.; Oshinsky, David M.; and Soderland, Jean R.

Children in close relationship to both parents Secure attachment is classified by children who show some distress when their caregiver leaves but are able to compose themselves knowing that their caregiver will return. Children with secure attachment feel protected by their caregivers, and they know that they can depend on them to return. John Bowlby and Mary Ainsworth developed a theory known as attachment theory after inadvertently studying children who were patients in a hospital at which they were working. Attachment theory explains how the parent-child relationship emerges and provides influence on subsequent behaviors and relationships. Stemming from this theory, there are four main types of attachment: secure attachment, ambivalent attachment, avoidant attachment and disorganized attachment.Reisz, S., Duschinsky, R., and Siegel, D.J. (2017). Disorganized attachment and defense: Exploring John Bowlby's unpublished reflections. Retrieved from https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14616734.2017.1380055 Ambivalent attachment is defined by children who become very distressed when their caregiver leaves, and they are not able to soothe or compose themselves. These children cannot depend on their caregiver(s) to be there for them. This is a relatively infrequent case with only a small percentage of children in the United States affected.Cherry, K. A. (2006). What is attachment theory? Retrieved from http://psychology.about.com/od/loveandattraction/a/attachment01.htm Avoidant attachment is represented by children who avoid their caregiver, showing no distress when the caregiver leaves. These children react similarly to a stranger as do they with their caregiver. This attachment is often associated with abusive situations. Children who are reprimanded for going to their caregiver will stop seeking help in the future. Disoriented attachment is defined by children who have no consistent way to manage their separation from and reunion with the attachment figure. Sometimes these children appear to be clinically depressed. These children are often present in studies of high-risk samples of severely maltreated babies, but they also appear in other samples.Colin, V., & Low, N. (1991, June 21). Infant Attachment: What We Know Now. Retrieved December 1, 2014, from http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports/inatrpt.htm Children who have a secure attachment to their primary caregiver will grow to have higher self-esteem as well as better self-reliance.

(2006). What is attachment theory? Retrieved from http://psychology.about.com/od/loveandattraction/a/attachment01.htm Characteristics Children who are securely attached typically are visibly upset as their caregivers leave, but they are happy upon their return. These children seek comfort from their parent or caregiver when frightened. In an instance when their parent or primary caregiver is not available, these children can be comforted to a degree by others, but they prefer their familiar parent or caregiver. Likewise, when parents with secure attachments reach out to their children, the children welcome the connection.Cherry, K. (2014, January 1). 7 Things You Should Know About Attachment Styles.

Inside the room, there were some toys and a confederate, fulfilling the role of stranger. The Strange Situation had eight episodes lasting three minutes each. The behavior of the infant was observed during each phase. The mother, baby and experimenter were all together initially. This phase lasted less than one minute. Then the mother and baby were alone in the room. A stranger, confederate, joined the mother and infant. After a set time had passed, the mother would leave the room, leaving her child with the stranger. The children with a secure attachment to their mother would cry for a few minutes but were able to compose themselves and play with the toys. Once the mother returned, the children with secure attachments greeted them and returned to play. Sometimes, they would show their mothers the toys with which they had played. As the mother returned, the stranger left. Then the mother left and the infant was left alone. The stranger returned. Lastly, the mother returned and the stranger left. This strange situation became the basis of the attachment theory.McLeod, S. A. (2008). Mary Ainsworth. Retrieved from http://www.simplypsychology.org/mary-ainsworth.html Criticisms J.R. Harris is one of the main critics of attachment theory. She suggests that people assume that honest and respectful parents will have honest and respectful children, et cetera. However, this may not be the case. Harris argues that children's peers have more influence on one's personality than their parents. The common example used is a child with immigrant parents. The children are able to continue to speak their parent's original language whilst at home, but the children can also learn the new language and speak it without an accent, while the parents' accent remains. Harris claims that children learn these things from their peers in an attempt to fit in with others.Lee, E. (2003, January 1). The Attachment System Throughout the Life Course: Review and Criticisms of Attachment Theory. Retrieved November 17, 2014, from http://www.personalityresearch.org/papers/lee.html In the nature versus nurture debate within secure attachment, Harris takes a nature stance. She supports herself by stating that identical twins separated at birth showed more similarities in their hobbies and interests than twins raised in the same household. Aside from the nature argument, there are three additional criticisms. The attachment is assessed during momentary separations. Since these brief situations can be stressful, this is a limitation in the theory. A better demonstration of the child's reaction might have come from a situation in which the mother left, but the child did not experience excessive stress. Another limitation with the attachment model is the assumption that the mother is the primary attachment figure. Attachment can be expressed differently with each figure. For example, children may cry when one figure leaves while they might have trouble sleeping when another leaves. Additionally, physiological changes can occur during this situation, and they were not accounted for.Papalia, D. E., & Olds, S. W. (1997). Human development. London: McGraw- Hill.

Her marriage resulted in her resigning her teaching post as required under the education authority rules for married women. While this meant she had more time to paint, it went entirely against her preference. She and her husband founded the Milngavie Art Club in 1927. Armour exhibited regularly at the Royal Academy in London; the Royal Scottish Academy in Edinburgh and winning the Guthrie Prize in 1937; the Royal Society of Painters in Watercolour, the Scottish Society of Artists and the Royal Glasgow Institute of the Fine Arts. In 1941, she was elected an associate of the Royal Scottish Watercolour Society, becoming a full member in 1956. She became a member of the Royal Scottish Academy in 1958. After the Education Authority legislation for married women had been repealed, Armour returned to teaching still life painting at Glasgow School of Art from 1951 to 1962. Initially many of her students were returning servicemen who had had their training at the School interrupted by the war. Their interest and enthusiasm for modern European art influenced her, bringing more colour and fluidity to her work. She retired from teaching in 1962 and returned to painting full-time. This allowed a late flourish in her career and her work was in considerable demand. In 1972 she was awarded the Cargill Prize from the Royal Glasgow Institute of the Fine Arts and became a full member of the Institute in 1977.

During her training at the Glasgow School of Art from 1920 to 1924, Armour learned a sophisticated respect for strong composition, though her independence can be seen in her decision to paint a 'Pit Head Scene' for her diploma project rather than the expected religious subject painting and against the wishes of her tutor, Maurice Greiffenhagen. Her still life paintings with flowers - even though she also painted still life without flowers, as well as landscapes, seascapes and some portraits - are her most characteristic works. Armour learned from her contemporaries such as Anne Redpath and her close friend David Donaldson, and Still Life with Pomegranate is a fine example of her paintings of the late 1940s. During Armour's teaching at the Glasgow School of Art in the 1950s, she claimed to had learnt much from her students and their response to contemporary painting. As a result, her brushwork became freer and her colour brightened and became more vibrant. Armour and her husband often painted the sea at Blackwaterfoot on the Isle of Arran, and it was for these seascapes that she later told a friend that she would like to be remembered.

As of January 2, 2015, ClinicalTrials.gov lists 181,612 studies with locations in 50 US states and in 187 countries. Its registrations represent about 75% of what is available through the WHO Portal (ICTRP). Despite the fact that important progress has been made, the efforts of those overseeing ClinicalTrials.gov and the other, smaller, registries do not ensure that the public has an unbiased knowledge base accessible to all. For example, problems of the concordance between the ClinicalTrials.gov record and the published record have been identified for many protocol and results items. The registry traces back to the Health Omnibus Programs Extension Act of 1988 (HOPE or Public Law 100-607) which mandated the development of a database of AIDS Clinical Trials Information System. It would later be expanded under the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 (FDAMA or Public Act 105-115). The registry is run by the United States National Library of Medicine (NLM). Other registries Clinical trial registries are also set up and managed by governmental organizations, non- governmental organizations, universities, as well as commercial and nonprofit entities. This includes pharmaceutical companies, international organizations, and health organizations. A list is available at http://www.circare.org/registries.htm. The IFPMA Clinical Trials Portal is a major pharmaceutical industry initiative designed to increase the transparency of clinical trials by providing a convenient \\"one-stop-shop\\" for published clinical trial information. It helps to fulfill the commitment made by the research-based pharmaceutical industry in its Joint Position on the Disclosure of Clinical Trial Information via Clinical Trial Registries and Databases.

Smaller nations (by population) tend to be more trade-dependent than larger ones. In 2008, the most trade-dependent OECD member was Luxembourg, where trade was worth 313.08% of GDP, while the least trade-dependent was the United States, where trade made up 30.41% of GDP.  Free trade  Trading nations tend to favour free trade and economic integration, or at least seek market access for their products (they may also seek some form of protectionism for their own industries). The most desired markets to access are the largest ones. In 2012, the Canadian news columnist Andrew Coyne described countries with free trade with both the European Union and the United States as a \\"select group\\" that includes Colombia, Israel, Jordan, Mexico, Morocco, and Peru. He described South Korea, Chile, and Singapore as \\"buccaneering free traders\\" and the only countries to rival Canada in \\"scale and scope of the trade agreements\\" that they had signed (roughly 75% of Canada's trade is tariff-free). South Korea has a free trade agreement with the United States and India and is negotiating with China and the European Union. Chile has free trade agreements with the United States, the European Union, Japan, China and Mexico but not India or Korea. Singapore has agreements with the United States, Japan, India, China, and South Korea and is in negotiations with the European Union. Coyne argued that if Canada successfully completed agreements with the EU, China, and India, around 90% of Canada's trade would be tariff-free, and it would then make sense to unilaterally abolish any remaining tariffs. Small countries or city-states that are extremely reliant on international trade are sometimes called entrep√¥ts, which typically engaged in the re-export of products produced elsewhere or finance and services (see offshore financial centre). Modern examples include Hong Kong, Singapore, and Dubai. Both developed and developing countries rely on trade. Many developing nations pursue a policy of export-oriented industrialization, which they hope will lead to export-led growth.  Types  There are three types of exporting economies: commodity exporters, manufacturing exporters, and services exporters. Most countries, however, do not fall purely in one category. Commodity exporters include countries with large deposits of natural resources or large amounts of farmland, with populations too small to use all their own resources. The trade of many commodity exporters is dominated by a single commodity. Most least developed countries are reliant on agricultural exports. A 1998 statistical review by the Food and Agriculture Organization showed that 32 developing countries relied on a single commodity for more than half of their agricultural export earnings.http://www.fao.org/trade/docs/UNCTAD-SCEs.htm Agricultural exporters are generally members of the Cairns Group, a coalition of 19 countries that lobby for more market access. Fossil fuel exporters, such the OPEC countries, are an important and influential subset of commodity exporters. Manufacturing exporters include many densely populated countries where human labour is the most important resource. They include wealthy countries such as Germany and Japan, as well as developing nations like China and India. Services-exporting countries include hubs of international finance, tourism, healthcare, and education. Many highly developed countries export services. Some countries export all of commodities, manufactures, and services. For example, Canada is regularly described as a trading nation as its total trade is worth more than two-thirds of its GDP (the second highest level in the G7 after Germany), which includes all sectors of the economy.

Items that were produced by the company are known as \\"Duncan glass\\" or \\"Duncan Miller glass.\\" The company was founded in 1865 by George Duncan with his two sons and son-in-law in the South Side neighborhood of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. By 1890, the company joined other glass companies to form the United States Glass Company, a powerful glass trust. In 1892, the factory was destroyed in a fire, and the company was relieved of its trust relationship with the US Glass Company. After the fire, the second generation of the Duncan family moved operations to Washington, Pennsylvania. In 1900, John Ernest Miller, the company's long-time designer, became a full shareholder along with members of the Duncan family. By 1955, economic pressures from machine-produced glass forced the company to sell off its assets to the US Glass Company, who continued to produce Duncan-style glass until 1980. History In 1865, George Duncan purchased the Ripley & Company glass factory at 10th and Carson Streets in the South Side neighborhood of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania from D.C. Ripley, a former business partner of Duncan. The factory was located adjacent to the Monongahela River, which provided easy access to transportation. A new company, George Duncan & Sons, was formed by Duncan, his sons Harry B. Duncan and James E. Duncan, and Augustus H. Heisey, who was married to George's daughter Susan. In 1874, John Ernest Miller, a 20-year veteran of the glass manufacturing industry, joined the company as a designer. He was previously the foreman of the mould shop at King, Son and Company. The addition of Miller proved to be fortuitous, because Miller's designs over the next 52 years became internationally famous. In 1877, George Duncan died and James E. Duncan took control of the company. Duncan & Miller Glass Company location in Washington, Pennsylvania. In 1890, the United States Glass Company formed a glass trust that included the George Duncan & Sons operation. In 1892, their factory was destroyed by fire, relieving the company of their trust relationship. After the fire, son-in-law Augustus Heisey left the company to begin his own glass manufacturing operation in Newark, Ohio. James E. Duncan built a new factory on Jefferson Avenue in Washington, Pennsylvania, where access to railroads was convenient, and the natural gas which was needed to power the furnaces was inexpensive. Construction of the plant, which featured a 16 Pot Deep Eye furnace, was finished on January 3, 1893. The first pattern produced in the new facility was the well-known Mitchell pattern. The new operation was named George Duncan's Sons & Co. On November 15, 1900, after James Duncan's death, the firm was officially incorporated as Duncan and Miller Glass Company, with John Ernest Miller joining the Duncan family as stockholders. The company abruptly ceased operations on June 13, 1955. By then, modern assembly lines and glassmaking machinery caused hand made glass to be uneconomical. The remaining inventory was sold at greatly reduced prices, causing glass collectors to travel hundreds of miles to purchase the final pieces. The molds and equipment were sold to the US Glass Company, where their Duncan Division in Tiffin, Ohio continued to produce Duncan-ware pieces. A number of Duncan employees also joined US Glass Company in Tiffin. The Duncan factory was sold to Andy Bros., but before they could move in, a fire destroyed the building on June 29, 1956. Production of the Duncan-ware glass ceased in 1980.  Duncan craftsmanship  A ruby red pitcher in Duncan's Georgian pattern. At its peak, Duncan & Miller's glass was one of Washington's most successful manufacturing concerns, and was more widely known throughout the county than any other line of goods made in Washington. The glass making processes and technologies at Duncan & Miller did not significantly differ from contemporary glassmakers in Western Pennsylvania and neighboring Ohio and West Virginia. Duncan differentiated itself through exceptional artistry and design. This was accomplished by employing highly skilled workers, and using unique batch formulas to produce colorful glass. The production process for each piece usually required 10 craftsmen. Some of the most popular styles were produced during the 1920s through the 1940s, including the Canterbury, Caribbean, Hobnail, Nautical, Sandwich, Spiral Flutes and Teardrop. The most famous design was a swan which required 14 craftsmen. The most popular etching designs were the First Love, Language of Flowers, and Passion Flower.  Legacy and collections  The National Duncan Glass Society was founded in 1975 at a meeting of glass collectors at the Citizens Library in Washington, Pennsylvania. For the next 17 years, the society operated a Duncan Glass museum at the Washington County Historical Society office and the F. Julius LeMoyne House. On July 8, 1993, the society opened a stand-alone museum in an old building on Jefferson Avenue, near the original location of the Duncan glass plant. One of the Duncan family residences was a 17-room Victorian mansion on Wade Avenue in Washington, Pennsylvania that was built in 1892. This mansion is now used as the Washington & Jefferson College President‚Äôs House. Its design is archetypical Queen Anne Victorian style, with ornate \\"gingerbread\\" details, stained and beveled glass, recessed doors and windows, and louvered wooden shutters. In 1944, Walter Hudson Baker, who was a graduate of Washington & Jefferson College, donated the house to the college in memory of his wife, Amy Duncan Baker; it has been used as the President's House since. It was profiled in a book of regional architecture by the Washington County History and Landmarks Foundation.

The land around the present day city was originally the home of the Haudensaunee, or the Onondaga Nation. They were members of the Iroquois Confederacy, which spanned most of Upstate New York. Over the course of 400 years, ethnic groups from all over the world have been attracted to the Central New York area, including the African, Asian, British, French, German, Greek, Irish, Italian, Jewish, Lebanese, Latino, Native American, Pacific Islander, Polish, Assyrian, Ukrainian, and Welsh communities. Background The first whites to arrive in Onondaga County were the French missionaries. The English arrived soon after. Recent demographics indicate that the largest ancestries represented in the city includes African American (27.9%), Irish (15.9%), Italian (14.1%), German (12.2%), English (7.6%), Hispanic (6.5%), Polish (5.0%), Asian (4.0%) and Pacific Islander (1.1%). African The city's Black community dates to the early 19th century when the first African slave settled in the area. Syracuse was an active center for the abolitionist movement, due in large part to the influence of Gerrit Smith and a group allied with him, mostly associated with the Unitarian Church and their pastor The Reverend Samuel May in Syracuse, as well as with Quakers in nearby Skaneateles, supported as well by abolitionists in many other religious congregations. Prior to the Civil War, due to the efforts of Jermain Wesley Loguen and others in defiance of federal law, Syracuse was known as the \\"great central depot on the Underground Railroad\\". On October 1, 1851, William Henry, a freed slave known as \\"Jerry\\", was arrested under the Fugitive Slave Law. The anti-slavery Liberty Party was holding its state convention in the city, and when word of the arrest spread, several hundred abolitionists including Charles Augustus Wheaton broke into the city jail and freed Jerry. The event came to be widely known as the \\"Jerry Rescue\\".The Jerry Rescue - New York History Net By 2010, demographics showed that 31% of the population in Syracuse was of African descent. British The British took an active interest in the land around Onondaga Lake in the early 1700s. They befriended the Onondagas by giving them guns, which were highly prized. A British agent, William Johnson, acquired of land in the Mohawk country near present-day Johnstown, New York. In 1751, Johnson heard that the French intended on securing a military post close to some salt springs. He discussed the consequences of that action with the Onondagas and proposed that they grant him rights to all of Onondaga Lake and a two-mile band of land around it. The Onondagas agreed and were paid ¬£350 sterling. French The first Caucasians to arrive in the region around Syracuse, New York were the French. In 1615, Samuel de Champlain launched an attack against the Oneidas with the aid of the Huron and Algonquian Indians who were bitter enemies of the Iroquois. On August 5, 1654, Father Simon LeMoyne, a Jesuit missionary, arrived in the Onondaga village. During his short stay, LeMoyne drank from a spring which the Onondagas believed to be foul due to an evil spirit. He found it to be a salt water spring and he returned to Canada with salt made from the spring water. German The German immigrants who first settled in the farmlands around Syracuse beginning in the early 19th century came from all areas of Germany including Alsace which was then a part of France. During the 1820s and 1830s, most came from Southern Germany, namely: Baden, Bavaria, Hesse-Darmstadt and W√ºrttemberg which were the areas devastated by the Napoleonic War, among others. The arrivals from Northern Germany including Franconia, Lorraine and Prussia came later By 2010, demographics showed that 12.2% of the population in Syracuse was of German descent. Greeks The Greek population in the United States did not start growing until the 1880s. The largest waves entered the country from 1900 to 1920 and most were young males \\"who wished to make a fortune and then return to Greece,\\" although 70 percent ended up staying in America. In the early 20th century, most immigrants from Greece were from Laconia, in particular, the city of Sparta in Southern Greece. Since that time, immigration has diversified and new citizens come from all parts of Greece. During the 1980 U.S. Census, 1,852 people claimed Greek heritage in Onondaga County. Irish The Irish came to the territory of Onondaga County as soldiers with the English Army during the American Revolutionary War circa 1776, however, there were only a few hundred Irish who settled in Onondaga County before the era of the Great Famine from 1848 to 1855. The earliest Irish to arrive lived on farms in the outskirts of the city. Most were transplants from New England who, with other Yankee farmers, left rocky, barren soil for uncrowded, fertile land in Onondaga County. More than half these Irish were Protestant. They farmed their own land and were not subject to the hatred faced by later arriving Irish-Catholic immigrants. The Irishmen hired themselves out as farmhands to New England squires who owned most of the land. By working hard and saving, many were able to purchase land within five or ten years of their arrival. During a seven-year period from 1848 to 1855, over 5,000 Irish immigrants found their way to Onondaga County; about 2,000 settled in Syracuse. Immigrants from the same towns or counties back in Ireland often located in the same area. In Geddes, hundreds from Thurles in County Tipperary settled together. In the 1820s, when the Erie Canal was built from Albany to Buffalo, New York, the Irish were the chief laborers. Syracuse is located in the middle of the route and was considered the \\"hub\\" of the system. After the canal was finished, many of the Irish settled west of Syracuse on a hill overlooking the canal on the Far Westside. This area became known as Tipperary Hill and is a prominent Irish-American neighborhood in the city. By 2010, demographics showed that 15.9% of the population in Syracuse was Irish descent. Italian Italian immigrants came to the area around Syracuse, New York in the early 1880s after providing labor for the construction of the West Shore Railroad. The West Shore Railroad was the name of a railroad that ran from Weehawken, New Jersey, across the Hudson River from New York City, north along the west shore of the river to Albany, New York and then west to Syracuse with final destination in Buffalo. It was organized as a competitor to the New York Central and Hudson River Railroad, but was soon taken over by that company. They settled on the Northside of Syracuse in a neighborhood along North Salina Street known as Little Italy. By 2010, demographics showed that 14.1% of the population in Syracuse was Italian descent. Onondaga Indian The city stands at the northeast corner of the Finger Lakes Region in Onondaga County which is located in Central New York State. The county, as well as Onondaga Lake, were named after the early inhabitants, the Onondaga Indians, by French missionaries who arrived in the area in the 1600s and founded a mission on the edge of the lake. Ukrainians Ukrainians in Syracuse, New York area arrived in three separate waves and were three disparate groups of people. This is because Ukraine had been occupied by Austro-Hungarians and each group of Ukrainians were known by different names, depending on the nationality of the controlling group in the section of the country they were raised. As a result, most Ukrainians who immigrated to America knew very little about their own culture and the history of their people or country because they were raised in the culture of the occupying nation and educated in occupied schools. Syracuse's neighborhoods reflect the historically divided population of the city. Traditionally, Ukrainian- Americans settled in the Near Westside on West Fayette, Marcellus, Otisco, Geddes and Delaware Streets; or the Far Westside near Wilbur and Ulster Streets and also the Westside in the Sacred Heart Church area.

Additionally, in the US and in some other countries, computer fonts‚Äîthe digital instantiation of the shapes as vector outlines‚Äîmay be protected by copyright on the computer code that produces them. The name of a typeface may also be protected as a trademark. Copyright= Germany  In 1981, West- Germany passed the (\\"Law on the 1973 Vienna Agreement for the Protection of Type Faces and their International Deposit\\", also simply known as or \\"Type Faces Law\\"), according to which a typeface is initially protected under German copyright law for 10 years from first publication on. After the end of this initial ten-year period, the rights holder may pay a fee to prolong copyright status for additional 15 years only once. According to German law, every typeface thus ends up in the public domain after no more than 25 years from first publication onwards, after which it is also free to be digitized into a computer font, which in itself holds a much higher copyright protection status by German law than analogue typefaces due to being legally classified as a computer program. The name of a typeface can separately be registered as a trademark () for a fee, which like a digital font also holds much higher copyright protection status than an analogue typeface itself. If a typeface's name is trademarked, no other typeface may bear the same name, not even digital clones of the analogue typeface.  Ireland  Irish copyright law covers typefaces. Like the United Kingdom law (see below), it allows for using the typeface in the ordinary course of printing. The term of protection is 15 years from first publication.Copyright and Related Rights Act, 2000 (Ireland), ¬ß¬ß 84-85. Irishstatutebook.ie, Accessed January 31, 2013.  Israel  Courts in Israel have recognized copyright in Henri Friedlaender's Hadassah typeface for a term exceeding 48 years, forcing Masterfont's unauthorized digitization off the market.Misha Beletsky. \\"Hadassah Friedlaender\\". Typographica, 2016-05-09. Accessed 2019-09-21.  Japan  In Japan, typefaces have been held not to be covered by copyright, on the ground that they function primarily as a means of communicating information, rather than an appeal to aesthetic appreciation.Yagi v. Kashiwa Shobo K.K., II-1 Chosakuken Hanreishu 8 (9 Mar. 1979, Tokyo District Court) (the Typeface Design Case), cited in  Russia  In Russia the legal vacuum with soviet intellectual legacy combined with absence of specific law regulation of the fonts ‚Äì created the opposite situation, where all typefaces have copyright and payments can be collected by current law. According to the Russian Yur'yev legal bureau, at least 99 legal threats by Lebedev's design studio have been about the use of studio made typefaces in Russia without payment.  Switzerland  In Switzerland, there is no specific law for the protection of typefaces. So far, the jurisdiction has been very reluctant in admitting legal protection of any sort to typefaces. However, the denied protection is not imperative: in theory, typefaces could be protected based on both copyright and design law. Additionally, the name of a typeface can be protected by a trademark.  United Kingdom  In 1916, England recognized copyright in typefaces, but protected only the design with all the letters in their particular order.\\"Stephenson, Blake and Co. v. Grant, Legros & Co., 115 L.T.R. 666, 61 Sol. J. 55 (1916), reprinted in E.J.

The court recognized that the typeface design was subject to copyright under the then-current Copyright Act of 1911, an Act to Amend and Consolidate the Law Relating to Copyright, 1911, 1 & 2 Geo. 5, ch. 46 (Eng.). However, the plaintiff's victory was hollow. The court held that the copyright protected only the design in its entirety, with all the letters in their particular order. The defendant's embodiment of them into a font of his own, as opposed to a reproduction of the design with the letters in the same order, was held not to infringe. MacGillivray , supra at 327-28.\\" Terrence J. Carroll, Protection For Typeface Designs: A Copyright Proposal, 10 Santa Clara Computer & High Tech. L.J. 139, 169, n.181. The current United Kingdom copyright statute, enacted in 1989, expressly refers to copyrights in typeface designs. English law does consider that fonts are subject to copyright. However, this only covers typefaces for 25 years from first publication, and does not cover their usage by typographers.Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 (c. 48), ¬ß 54 (England), Legislation.gov.uk  United States  Typefaces cannot be protected by copyright in the United States (Code of Federal Regulations, Ch 37, Sec. 202.1(e); Eltra Corp. vs. Ringer). The idea that typefaces (rather than fonts, which are computer software) cannot be copyrighted in the United States is black letter law. 37 C.F.R. ¬ß 202.1(e). Under U.S. law, typefaces and their letter forms or glyphs are considered utilitarian objects whose public utility outweighs any private interest in protecting their creative elements. However, there is a distinction between a font and a typeface. The machine code used to display a stylized typeface (called a font) is protectable as copyright. In 1992, the US Copyright Office determined that digital outline fonts had elements that could be protected as software.\\"Registrability of Computer Programs that Generate Typefaces\\", 57 Fed. Reg. 6201 (Feb. 21, 1992), reproduced in U.S. Copyright Office announcement ML-443 Since that time, the Office has accepted registration of copyright for digital vector fonts, such as PostScript Type 1, TrueType, and OpenType format files. This is part of the basis of the 2017 lawsuit brought by Berthold LLC against Target Corporation for its alleged unlawful use of its fonts. Berthold v. Target, no. 1:17-cv-07180 (N.D. Ill.). It is also part of the basis for an unpublished 1998 opinion by Judge Whyte in Adobe Systems, Inc. v. Southern Software, Inc., finding that Adobe Software held a valid copyright for its Utopia font and that it had been infringed by the defendant(s) in that case. Historically, the unavailability of protection for typefaces reaches back to at least 1976. In 1988, the Copyright Office published a report titled Policy Decision on Copyrightability of Digitized Typefaces, which explains: \\"The decision in Eltra Corp. v. Ringer clearly comports with the intention of the Congress. Whether typeface designs should be protected by copyright was considered and specifically rejected by Congress in passing the Copyright Act of 1976. The 1976 House Report states: A \\"typeface\\" can be defined as a set of letters, numbers, or other symbolic characters, whose forms are related by repeating design elements consistently applied in a notational system, and are intended to be embodied in articles whose intrinsic utilitarian function is for use in composing text or other cognizable combinations of characters. The Committee does not regard the design of typeface, as thus defined, to be a copyrightable \\"pictorial, graphic, or sculptural work\\" within the meaning of this bill and the application of the dividing line in section 101 [H.R. Reg. No. 1476, 94th Cong., 2nd Sess 5 (1976)]. In addition to rejecting copyright protection for typeface designs, Congress deferred a decision on a more limited form of protection under proposed ornamental design legislation. Title II of the 1976 copyright revision bill as passed by the Senate could have protected typeface designs, but the House of Representatives had doubts about this limited form of protection. Consequently, only copyright revision passed. [H.R. Reg. No. 1476 at 50 and 55]. Design legislation has yet to be enacted, and Congress has chosen not to include typeface designs within the Copyright Act's definition of pictorial, graphic or sculptural works.\\" According to section 906.4 of the Compendium of U.S. Copyright Office Practices, typography and calligraphy are also not copyrightable in themselves. Design patents Typefaces may be protected by a design patent in many countries (either automatically, by registration, or by some combination thereof). A design patent is the strongest system of protection, but the most uncommon. It is the only US legal precedent that protects the actual design (the design of the individual shapes of the letters) of the font. A prominent example is the European Union, where the automatic protection (without registration) expires after three years and can be extended (by registration) up to 25 years. In 1981, Germany passed a special extension (Schriftzeichengesetz) to the design patent law (Geschmacksmustergesetz) for protecting typeface designs. This also permits typefaces to be registered as designs.  Trademarks  The names of particular fonts may be protected by a trademark. This is the weakest form of protection because only the font name itself is being protected. For example, the letters that make up the trademarked font Palatino can be copied but the name must be changed. URW++ was involved in a 1995 lawsuit with Monotype Corporation for cloning their fonts and naming them with a name starting with the same three letters. As typeface shapes themselves cannot be copyrighted in the United States, the lawsuit centered on trademark infringement. A US court decided that Monotype's trademarks were \\"fanciful\\" and did not have descriptive value of the actual products. However it also decided that URW was confusing the public deliberately because \\"the purloining of the first part of a well-known trademark and the appending of it to a worthless suffix is a method of trademark poaching long condemned by the courts.\\" The court issued an injunction preventing URW from using their chosen names.  Licensing  The basic standard for copyrighted digital font use is that a license is required for each individual font used on a computer, or in the case of businesses, one per entity. Under the license fonts are typically licensed only for use on one computer. These End User License Agreements (EULAs) generally state that fonts may only be used on machines that have a valid license. These fonts cannot be shared by multiple computers or given to others. These licenses can be obtained in three ways: directly from the font authors (e.g., Adobe), as part of a larger software package (e.g., Microsoft Office), or through purchasing or downloading the font from an authorized outlet. Such licenses typically only apply to the font file itself (which is a computer program), and not to the shape of the typeface, which may be subject to a design patent. Open-source font licenses include the General Public License with the Font Exception, the SIL Open Font License, and the Ubuntu Font License. Lawsuits From 1993 to 1995, Bitstream Inc. and four other type companies successfully sued SWFTE for copyright infringement. SWFTE was using special computer programs to take other type founders' fonts, convert them and give them new names. The case focused on the fact that SWFTE had used Bitstream's software to create these new fonts. Adobe Systems, Inc. v. Southern Software, Inc. helped clear the distinction between intellectual property protection for a font versus a typeface. SSI had used the FontMonger program to copy and rename fonts from Adobe and others. They assumed safety from prosecution because, though they had directly copied the points that define the shapes from Adobe's fonts, they had made slight adjustments to all the points so they were not technically identical. Nevertheless, it was determined that the computer code had been copied.Adobe Systems, Inc. v. Southern Software, Inc. , No. C 95-20710 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1941 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 2, 1998). In ,< Font Brothers filed a lawsuit against Hasbro, claiming that Hasbro used the ‚ÄúGeneration B‚Äù font for its My Little Pony product without permission. Font Brothers claimed that Hasbro had refused to comply with their licensing request. They are also claiming substantial damages, from loss of revenue for this misuse, and requesting a jury trial to resolve this matter. Most recently, Berthold LLC sued Target Corporation for its alleged breach of a font license agreement. Berthold LLC v. Target Corp., No. 1:17-cv-07180 (N.D. Ill.). Target recognized the distinction between a font and a typeface, and what is protectable under U.S. copyright laws. (See docket entry no. 21).

Its major mechanism of action is through the inhibition of human CYP3A proteins. Like ritonavir (Norvir), cobicistat is of interest for its ability to inhibit liver enzymes that metabolize other medications used to treat HIV, notably elvitegravir, an HIV integrase inhibitor. By combining cobicistat with elvitegravir, higher concentrations of the latter are achieved in the body with lower dosing, theoretically enhancing elvitegravir's viral suppression while diminishing its adverse side-effects. In contrast with ritonavir, the only other booster approved for use as a part of HAART, cobicistat has no anti-HIV activity of its own.Highleyman, L.

The second, elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide, is marketed as Genvoya and was approved by the FDA in November 2015 for use in the United States. Both Stribild and Genvoya are owned by Gilead Sciences. The third, cobicistat, darunavir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide, is marketed as Symtuza and was FDA approved July 17, 2018 and is owned by Janssen Pharmaceuticals. Additionally, in existence are a fixed-dose combination of cobicistat and protease inhibitor darunavir (darunavir/cobicistat; marketed as Prezcobix by Janssen Therapeutics), and a fixed-dose combination of cobicistat and protease inhibitor atazanavir (atazanavir/cobicistat; marketed as Evotaz by Bristol-Myers Squibb). Both Prezcobix and Evotaz were approved by the FDA in January 2015. Cobicistat is a potent inhibitor of cytochrome P450 3A enzymes, including the important CYP3A4 subtype. It also inhibits intestinal transport proteins, increasing the overall absorption of several HIV medications, including atazanavir, darunavir, and tenofovir alafenamide. Chemistry Cobicistat is a drug analogue of ritonavir, in which the valine moiety is exchanged for a 2-morpholinoethyl group, and the backbone hydroxyl group is removed. These changes effectively eliminate the anti-HIV activity of ritonavir while preserving its inhibitory effects on the CYP3A isozyme family of proteins. Cobicistat is therefore able to increase plasma concentration of other coadministered anti-HIV drugs without the risk of causing cobicistat- resistant mutations in the HIV virus. Synthesis Cobicistat may be synthesized from any number of commercially available starting materials. The synthesis shown below utilizes L-methionine and bromoacetic acid as starting materials.WO 2016128885 Discovery and development  Cobicistat was developed through structure-activity relationship studies using ritonavir and desoxyritonavir as lead compounds. These studies were conducted by scientists at Gilead Sciences, and successfully optimized ritonavir into a potent CYP3A inhibitor lacking anti-HIV activity. Cobicistat shows potent, selective inhibition of the CYP3A isozyme family (IC50 0.15 ŒºM) compared to some CYP1A and CYP2C isozymes. As cobicistat was discovered using structure-activity relationship studies, its CYP3A binding is still poorly understood; however, research on the protein-ligand interactions between CYP3A4 and ritonavir analogues demonstrates that CYP 3A4 residues Ile369, Ala370, Met371, as well as Arg105 and Ser119, play an important role in ritonavir analogue inhibition of CYP3A4.PDB 3NXU  References  External links  * Category:Cytochrome P450 inhibitors Category:Thiazoles Category:Morpholines Category:Carbamates Category:Ureas Category:Isopropyl compounds Category:Orphan drugs ","title":"Cobicistat"},{"id":"29240019","text":"Symphony No. 20 may refer to: *Symphony No. 20 (Brian) in C-sharp minor by Havergal Brian, 1962 *Symphony No. 20 (Haydn) in C major (Hoboken I/20) by Joseph Haydn, c. 1761 *Symphony No. 20 (Michael Haydn) in C major (Perger 12, Sherman 20, MH 252) by Michael Haydn, 1777 *Symphony No. 20 (Hovhaness) (Op. 223, Three Journeys to a Holy Mountain) by Alan Hovhaness, 1968 *Symphony No. 20 (Mozart) in D major (K. 133) by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, 1772 *Symphony No. 20 (Myaskovsky) in E major (Op. 50) by Nikolai Myaskovsky, 1940 020 ","title":"Symphony No. 20"},{"id":"29240055","text":"Dick Thornton is the name of: * Dick Thornton (American football) (1908‚Äì1973), American football quarterback for the Philadelphia Eagles * Dick Thornton (Canadian football) (1939‚Äì2014), Canadian football wide receiver and defensive back for the Winnipeg Blue Bombers and Toronto Argonauts ","title":"Dick Thornton"},{"id":"29240061","text":"Spirit way at the Ming Dynasty Tombs outside of Beijing. Spirit way of Kong Zhengan in the Cemetery of Confucius A spirit way () is the ornate road leading to a Chinese tomb of a major dignitary. The term is also sometimes translated as spirit road, spirit path or sacred way. The spirit way is lined on both sides by a succession of statues, pillars, and stelae. The statues along the spirit way depict real and mythical animals, as well as civilian and military officials. History=Eastern Han Dynasty Spirit ways were a well-developed feature of tombs by the time of the Eastern Han Dynasty.Albert E. Dien, Six dynasties civilization, Yale University Press, 2007 A traditional burial site of an emperor or a high official of that era would be typically arranged along the north‚Äìsouth axis; the spirit road would lead from the south to the southern gate of the enclosure within which the tomb itself and the associated buildings were located. This layout, with few exceptions, has persisted since then through the entire history of the spirit road. A characteristic feature of an East Han spirit road were monumental towers (que), which were much larger and more expensive than the statues and stelae. The que were followed by statues of animals, among whom feline-like creatures were prominent: both fairly realistic-looking tigers (long known to Chinese artists) and lions (a Han Dynasty innovation), as well as more fantastic varieties, provided with wings, beards, and/or horns. The feline-based fantastic creatures were known under a variety of names, among which the most common were tianlu, bixie and qilin. As in later dynasties, the creatures were facing the road, and were designed to be primarily viewed from the sides. There is no definitive information about any elephants appearing on Han Dynasty spirit roads; however, it is speculated that an ancient stone elephant (which may have originally been part of a pair) 2 km south of the Eastern Han imperial mausolea near Mangshan (in Luoyang area) may have been associated with those mausolea: the two elephants may have marked the entrance to the mausoleum area. As on the later spirit ways, the stone animals on the Eastern Han spirit roads must have been followed by human statues, but very few of those have survived. A pair of well-preserved stone officials from that period are now kept at the Temple of Confucius, Qufu. The last component of the Eastern Han spirit roads, the stelae are believed to be a stone reproduction of wooden slabs, which in the ancient times were placed on both sides of the open grave during the burial. The coffin was lowered into the grave on ropes passed through holes made in each slab. After the burial, those wooden slabs would be placed upright on top of the tomb, with appropriate text written on them. In reminder of that old custom, early spirit way stelae have a round hole in the middle of their upper parts. Southern Dynasties Two of Xiao Xiu's stele-bearing turtles, and the base of one of the two columns The fall of the Han Empire was followed by a period of upheaval, when China was divided between a number of short-lived Southern and Northern Dynasties. The Wei and Western Jin rulers (3rd century AD) seemed to have frowned upon funeral art extravagance of the fallen Han Dynasty, generally shunning above-ground statuary at their tomb sites. Literary sources attest to the resumption of the spirit way construction already by the time of the Eastern Jin (4th century AD), but the surviving spirit way statuary from the \\"period of disunion\\" pertains almost exclusively to the last four of the six Southern Dynasties: Liu Song, Southern Qi, Liang and Chen, which were usually centered around Jiankang (today's Nanjing). Around thirty of their tomb statuary groups, in various degrees of preservation, are known to modern researchers. They are located primarily in the eastern and southeastern suburbs of Nanjing (Qixia and Jiangning Districts) and in Danyang, farther east. The Southern Dynasties regimes, with their smaller economic base than the mighty Han, did not create as numerous and as grandiose funeral ensembles as the Qin and Han. The use of spirit ways under these dynasties was limited to emperors and their close relatives. The new Buddhist and Daoist currents in the spiritual life of south China greatly influenced the art of sculpture as well. In the words of the art historian Ann Paludan, in Daoism-influenced art, \\"Han emphasis on spatial relationships, forms, and limits was rejected in favour of flowing lines suggesting flexibility, a lack of clear-cut boundaries, and endless motion\\". The newly reinterpreted feng shui principles called more attention to orienting the tomb with respect to the terrain than to the strict north‚Äìsouth axis. A typical Southern Dynasties spirit way was quite short and included a pair of giant (3‚Äì4 m tall) winged felines, a pair of columns, and a pair or two of memorial stelae. These felines, whom connoisseurs called \\"the most noble creatures to guard any tomb in Asia\\" came in two varieties. The qilin, distinguished by their horns and beards, appeared at emperor's tombs, while the princes of blood (wang) had the bixie, who sported lions' manes and long outstretched tongues in their wide-opened mouths. While both fantastic species must have derived from the Han era animal statuary, experts distinguish the two's pedigrees. The stocky bixie is thought to have evolved from the tiger statues of Han-era tombs in Sichuan and Shandong; however, there is now more emphasis on the power of the creature than on its speed. It is not clear any more what the symbolism of the outstretched tongue was: it has been variously interpreted as a prayer for rain, or as a way of communicating with the world of spirits. The more elegant and sinuous qilin, their bodies almost completely covered with complicated patterns of carved curves, have a touch of Chinese dragon in them, and may have been related to the Han tomb statues from central China (e.g. the pair from Cuanlinmiao in Luoyang). File:Tomb of Xiao Jing - Bixie.JPGA bixie from the tomb of Xiao Jing (Liang Dynasty) File:Tomb Yongning of the Ts'en Dynasty.JPGA qilin from the Yongning Tomb of the Emperor Wen of Chen Ming Dynasty Later on, the layout of many mausolea involves a large stone tortoise (bixi) along with the spirit way. At Ming Dynasty mausolea in Nanjing, e.g. Ming Xiaoling or the tomb of the Sultan of Brunei Abdul Majid Hassan, visitors are first met by a bixi holding a stone tablets extolling the virtues of the deceased, and then walk along the spirit way to the tumulus where the emperor or dignitary is actually buried.

He was son of Colonel Ebenezer Tappan, a manufacturer and State Legislator of the prominent Tappan family of Massachusetts. He was also a first cousin once removed of abolitionists and philanthropists Lewis Tappan and Arthur Tappan, and their brother and U. S. Senator Benjamin Tappan of Ohio. Born in Manchester, Massachusetts, and initially involved in business in Boston, Lewis went to Kansas in 1857 to join his cousin, Samuel Forster Tappan (1831‚Äì1913), who was already heavily involved in the Free-State movement as clerk of the Topeka Constitutional Convention and later, acting Speaker of the State House of Representatives. Lewis became Secretary of the Senate under the Topeka Constitution and one of the Fort Scott Treaty Commissioners.Lamson, Rev. Darius Francis (1895). \\"History of the Town of Manchester, Essex County, Massachusetts\\", published by the town.

In 1859, Lewis moved to Colorado Territory where he joined the first city government of Denver, built its first frame building with his brother George Hooper Tappan (1833‚Äì1865), and operated the first store in the territory. He was further involved in territory politics as a member of Governor Gilpin's council and as a staff member to Governor Cummings.Lamson, Rev. Darius Francis (1895). \\"History of the Town of Manchester, Essex County, Massachusetts\\", published by the town. In the summer of 1860, the two brothers opened their store after constructing the first frame building in the town‚Äîtwo stories high. He was a member of the city government of Denver and organized the first Sunday School there. Coming to the Pike's Peak region in 1859, Lewis N. Tappan, along with several other town promoters, met in Denver City and organized the Colorado City Town Company on August 11, 1859, founding Colorado City on August 12. A few days later, on August 15, 1859, Tappan and many of the same eager town promoters organized the El Paso Claim Club, a vigilante form of civil government, to record real estate claims and settle land disputes. Tappan not only became the Town Company's director, secretary, and treasurer, but he also became the Claim Club's director, secretary, and recorder. Colorado City is now a national historic district within Colorado Springs, where he operated a general and mining supplies store. Although Lewis Tappan was active within the business community of Colorado City and El Paso County, Tappan still found time to explore the surrounding area. In 1859, Tappan, Anthony Bott, George Bute, Melancthon S. Beach, A.D. Richardson, several people from Golden City, and several women hiked to the summit of Pikes Peak, taking several days. At the summit, the hikers found evidence of others having reached the summit. Records indicate the members of the Lawrence, Kansas, prospecting party hiked to the summit in the summer of 1858. Tappan was one of the first 3 white men to enter the region known as \\"Garden of the Gods\\", which they named. The name of the park goes back to August 1859. Several surveyors including Lewis N. Tappan, who would later discover a lead mine in Quartz valley, explored the area. Upon discovering the site, one of the surveyors, Melancthon S. Beach, said it would be a \\"capital place for a beer garden.\\" His companion, Rufus Cable, who was awestruck by the impressive rock formations, replied, \\"Beer Garden! Why it is a fit place for the gods to assemble. We will call it the Garden of the Gods.\\" As with other early entrepreneurs in Colorado City, Lewis N. Tappan and his brother, George H. Tappan, owned and operated a general store in Colorado City, \\"Tappan & Co.\\", along with their first store in Denver and another in Golden. They were also assisted by their brother William Henry Tappan (1821‚Äì1907). In 1866, Tappan married Elizabeth Sanford, daughter of Giles Sanford of Albany, New York Lewis returned to Manchester and was elected to the Mass. legislature in 1877. He was a prominent real estate developer in Manchester and maintained homes both there and in Boston. Making several trips across the Great Plains, he became active in mining in Leadville, CO, discovering a lead mine and building the first smelting works in the territory. Following a tragic accident he witnessed when a guest of his fell to his death in a shaft while touring with Lewis, he went into shock and never recovered from it. Lewis Tappan died of nervous prostration in 1880.Tappan, Daniel Langdon (1915). \\"Tappan-Toppan Genealogy\\",privately published by the compiler, Arlington, MA.

Brakes The M600 uses steel brake discs with six piston calipers at the front and four piston calipers at the rear. The brakes are designed by Britain based braking specialist Alcon. Owing to the driver focused nature of the car, there is no Anti-lock Braking System installed and the brakes have limited servo assistance. Interior The interior of the car has twin hide upholstery and gloss carbon-fibre trim as standard. Buyers have the choice to choose from leather, suede an advantage upholstery along with knurled wood trim and wool carpeting. The switches and instrumentation are bespoke to the M600, although some components are shared with Jaguar and Aston Martin models. The car is equipped with an adjustable steering column and driver's seat while the pedals are offset to the left. The pedals are adjusted according to the owner's preference in order to provide a good driving position. A highlight of the interior is the engine power control knob, similar to Ferrari's Manettino dial, which allows the driver to choose from variable engine power outputs along with related turbo boost pressure (Road, Track and Race). The knob is present ahead of the gearshift knob on the dashboard. A traction control switch activates the limited traction control which is present to avoid oversteer. The interior is based on simplicity and is driver focused, inspired by the Ferrari F40 and due to this, it does away with climate control and modern infotainment systems.

First in Series 14, Episode 5 by Jeremy Clarkson, who praised the car considerably and the show's racing driver the Stig took it around the Top Gear track and it did a 1:17.7 on a cold day, beating the Pagani Zonda F Roadster and the Bugatti Veyron. In Series 18, Episode 1 co-host Richard Hammond drove a left-hand drive version of the car through Italy and the clutch failed, causing clutch material to damage the gearbox; Noble sent the production team another car. Later in the same episode Hammond drove it during a challenge where he attempted to beat a laptime set by the Stig at the Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari on the outskirts of Imola. Despite the breakdown, Hammond heaped considerable praise on the car. It has also been featured in the American adaptation of the show where it receives considerable praise, the main \\"challenge\\" was to reach its top speed, the vehicle reached but stopped because the vehicle ran out of space on the runway it was being tested on.

Family background The Annals of the Four Masters record Ulick's accession in 1485: Ulick Burke, Lord of Clanrickard, heir of the Earl of Ulster, a general patron of the learned of Ireland, died; and his son, another Ulick, took his place. An army was led by this son into Machaire-Chonnacht, and into Hy-Many, and burned and destroyed corn and towns; and, among other things, he burned and demolished the castle of Tulsk, and the prison. Burke was an especially aggressive warlord, and sought to impose his authority over not only his fellow Bourkes in north Connacht, but over the Ui Maine, the S√≠ol Muireadaigh and the independent towns of Athenry and Galway. In 1486, A numerous army was led by O'Donnell into Connaught, and another by Mac William of Clanrickard, to oppose him. On coming together, however, they agreed to conditions of peace and amity. Felim Finn O'Conor repaired to these armies, and gave himself up into the hands of O'Donnell, in behalf of his territories and chieftains. The peace of Sil-Murray was concluded on this occasion; and the son of Felim Finn was taken as a hostage, instead of Felim Finn himself, by O'Donnell, who took him with him into Tirconnell, by the advice of Mac William of Clanrickard. The following year, An army was led by Mac William of Clanrickard (Ulick, the son of Ulick of the Wine) into Hy-Many, by which he destroyed the bawn of Athliag Maenagan, and destroyed much corn and many towns throughout Hy-Many and Machaire-Chonnacht. Rossa, the son of Felim Finn, was slain by one shot of a dart by a man of this army. The sons of Felim Finn O'Conor (i.e. Hugh, Turlough, and Conor) passed by them to Baile-tobair- Bhrighde, which they burned and plundered. Dermot, the son of Donnell, son of Turlough Dall O'Conor, while pursuing them, was slain at Roscommon; but his people followed them into Clann-Conway, and took some horses from them. It was at the instance, of O'Conor Don (i.e. Hugh, the son of Hugh, son of Turlough Don) that this incursion was made. The Sil-Murray concluded a peace among themselves, after having refused to do so, by the advice of their friends. Marriage to Lady FitzGerald Gearoid M√≥r Fitzgerald, 8th Earl of Kildare, in an attempt to restrain Burke's power, married him off to his daughter, Lady Estacia FitzGerald. However, there was only so much he could do against Burke on a local level. Neither could he prevent Burke from taking additional wives, including Slaine Ni Con Mara. Activities * 1495 ‚Äì Mac William of Clanrickard, i.e. Rickard Oge, came to Lower Connaught, and whatever O'Donnell had not destroyed was destroyed by him. * 1498 ‚Äì Slaine, the daughter of Mac Namara (Sida Cam), and wife of Mac William of Clanrickard (Ulick, the son of Ulick), died. * 1500 ‚Äì Mac William Burke was drawn to their assistance by O'Conor and the sons of William O'Kelly. The castle of Athleague was taken by him, and given up to the sons of William O'Kelly; and Conor O'Kelly, the second lord that was over Hy-Many, was taken prisoner in it, and delivered, together with the hostages of the subchiefs of Hy-Many, up to Melaghlin, the son of Teige, son of Donough, who assumed the full lordship of Hy-Many on that occasion. The castle of Tulsk was taken by Mac William and O'Conor; and the son of Carbry, son of Brian, was killed in it by a bullet-shot; and the hostages of the descendants of Felim, and their castles, were given to O'Conor. Mac William made peace between O'Conor and Mac Dermot; and each gave up hostages into the keeping of the other, namely, Owen, son of O'Conor, and Carbry, son of O'Conor. * 1501 ‚Äì Edmond, the son of Rickard Burke, was taken by Mac William of Clanrickard, on his return from the pilgrimage of St. James in Spain. A great ransom was exacted for him, and good hostages of his people, besides his son. Knockdoe By the early 1500s, Burke's power had grown to the point where he was the pre-eminent lord in Connacht, viewed as a threat both by FitzGerald and Hugh Dubh O'Donnell, King of T√≠r Chonaill, who viewed north Connacht as one of his domains. To make matters worse, Burke entered into a successful alliance with Toirdhealbhach Donn √ì Brien, King of Thomond. Early in 1503, Mac William of Clanrickard gave a very great overthrow to O'Kelly and a party of the people of Conmaicne-Cuile, where the greater part of the gallowglasses of both the Clann-Donnell and Clann-Sweeny were slain around their constables, and where Walter, the son of John Burke, a distinguished captain, was also slain. This was followed up with a successful encounter against the king of Ui Maine, at Bel Atha na nGarbhan: * The defeat of Bel-atha-na-ngarbhan was given by John Burke, the son of Ulick, son of Ulick, grandson of Rickard, Tanist of Clanrickard, to O'Kelly, in which fell Walter, the son of John, son of Thomas Burke, heir to the lordship of Conmaicne, and many others of the Clann-Donnell and Clann-Dowell, were slain. Burke followed this by attacking, seizing and demolishing three of O Cellaigh's castles. * Three castles belonging to O'Kelly, viz. Garbh-dhoire, Muine-an-mheadha, and Gallach, were demolished by Mac William Burke (i.e. Ulick the Third). O'Kelly, i.e. Melaghlin, went to the Lord Justice to complain of the injury done him, the result of which was, defeat of Cnoc- Tuagh. O Ceallaigh had a personal motive, in that his wife was in open adultery with Burke. FitzGerald had a similar motive, in that his daughter was being slighted by the affair, but, with Burke's capture of the independent towns of Athenry and Galway, the matter had become national and could no longer be ignored. FitzGerald assembled an alliance of Gaelic-Irish and Anglo- Irish lords, led by himself, to confront Burke. They included √ì Donnell of T√≠r Conaill, √ì Neill of T√≠r Eoghain, √ì Connor Roe, MacDermot of Moylurg, Bourke of north Connacht and many lords of The Pale. Supporting Burke were √ì Brian and MacNamara of Thomond, √ì Carroll of Ely, √ì Kennedy of Ormond, Mac I Briens of Aran, plus several Gallowglass units. At the Battle of Knockdoe in August 1504, Burke was defeated. Later life The annals record little of Burke's activities till recording his death in 1509. All but three of the subsequent Clanricarde's and Earl of Clanricarde would be his descendants.

Its construction started in 1912, ended in 1913 and the library opened for business on October 25, 1913. The original building was inspired by the classical architectural tradition and incorporates many elements of the Italian Renaissance architecture, such as round arches, supported by pilasters with extruding head stones on the fa√ßade; decorative pediments that echoed Ancient Greek Temples; ornamentation, which included non-structural brackets on the interior, two fireplaces with sculpted angel faces on both sides of each fireplace, natural motifs, etc.; a slightly hipped roof with what seems like an entablature, created with the use of brick ornamentation and terra cotta veneer; the attempt to create a \\"perfect\\" square-shaped plan of the library with barrel-vaulted ceilings and a courtyard. The library has undergone two major renovations. The first was done in 1975-1976 by architects Howard V. Walker and Howard D. Chapman, which mainly affected the plan of the library since the facade remained virtually intact. The second renovation was from 2006 to 2009. The architects involved in this project were Rounthwaite, Dick and Hadley Architects inc, Shoalts and Zaback, and ERA. As a result of this renovation, the library now has a \\"glass box\\" addition, its main entrance has been lowered by approximately half a metre and some of the interior features, such as the staircase, have been altered for functional reasons.

The biphasic solution is then agitated to distribute these reagents throughout the aqueous and organic phases. If an anionic surfactant is present, then the cationic methylene blue and the anionic surfactant forms an ion pair, which is extracted into the organic phase. The color saturation of the chloroform increases with the concentration of anionic surfactants. MBAS assay is an ASTM International standard technique for detecting anionic surfactants.ASTM D2330 - 02 Standard Test Method for Methylene Blue Active Substances These include carboxylates, phosphates, sulfates, and sulfonates. An MBAS assay alone does not, however, identify specific surfactants. ASTM withdrew the standard (ASTM D2330-02) in 2011 pending a review and update of the method, which was last approved in 2003.

In it, Degas depicts his uncle Michel Musson's cotton brokerage business (which several years later went bankrupt in an economic crash, according to Michael McMahon of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette when the firm was swamped by the postwar growth of the much larger Cotton Exchange). In the painting, Musson is seen examining raw cotton for its quality while Degas' brother Rene reads The Daily Picayune. Another brother, Achille, rests against a window wall at left while others, including Musson's partners, go about their business.Excellent Exhibitions Detail Mark of French Influence, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, July 3, 1999 A Cotton Office in New Orleans was the first painting by Degas to be purchased by a museum, and the first by an Impressionist.Degas and the Business of Art: A Cotton Office in New Orleans, Marilyn Brown, Pennsylvania State University Press, 1994 Degas' sale of the piece marked a turning point in his career as he moved from being a struggling, unrecognized artist to a recognized and financially stable artist, according to Marilyn Brown in her book Degas and the Business of Art: A Cotton Office in New Orleans.Degas and the Business of Art: A Cotton Office in New Orleans, Marilyn Brown, Pennsylvania State University Press, 1994. Degas traveled from Europe to New Orleans in late 1872 with his brother, Ren√©, to visit his mother's brother, Michael Musson. After the American Civil War, Ren√© had joined his uncle's cotton business in New Orleans. Degas was to return to Europe in January 1873, but when his return trip was delayed, he was asked by his relatives to paint their portraits, and decided to show them as a group, at work in the family office. Degas crafted his work with the intent of selling it to a British textile manufacturer. But a drop in stock prices worldwide and declines in the cotton and art markets ended his hopes for that specific sale.Degas and the Business of Art: A Cotton Office in New Orleans, Marilyn Brown, Pennsylvania State University Press, 1994. Degas then exhibited A Cotton Office in New Orleans in the second Impressionist show in Paris in 1876. Degas finally sold the painting in 1878 to the newly founded Musee des Beaux-Arts in Pau, France. The painting is sometimes mistakenly referred to as The Cotton Exchange at New Orleans, referring to the historic New Orleans Cotton Exchange.  References Sources *Brown, Marilyn R.; (1994).

Except for activation of a school group from the Regular Army's Inactive component for primary flying training at March Field,The 13th School Group, activated July 31, 1927, consisted of the 47th, 53rd, and 54th School Squadrons, 70th Service squadron, and 23rd Photo Section. The group inactivated on April 30, 1931. Two other RAI school groups also constituted 6 Feb 1923, the 14th and 15th, were never activated in their original roles.() resulting in creation of the 24th School Wing, and reallocation of four existing tactical squadrons to new groups in 1927 and 1928,6th and 19th Pursuit Squadrons from the 5th Composite Group to the 18th Pursuit Group, the 11th Bombardment Squadron from the 2nd Bombardment to 7th Bombardment Group, and the 23rd Bombardment Squadron from the 5th Composite Group to the 19th Bombardment Group. the organization of the Air Corps remained largely unchanged from this list until November 1930. The actual date of this list is February 15, 1925. At that time the Air Service had 32 tactical squadrons (eight pursuit, eight bombardment, two attack, and 14 observation), under the command of the corps areas and departments in which they were located, and 17 service and training squadrons controlled by the Office of Chief of Air Service (OCAS). The tactical squadrons were organized into seven groups and the divisional air services for three active Regular Army infantry divisions and six paper divisions. In addition to the seven tactical and two training groups active in the Regular Army, six additional groups had been constituted in the Regular Army Inactive (RAI) component to facilitate mobilization.These were the 7th Bombardment, 8th Pursuit, 12th Observation, and 13th through 15th School Groups. Ultimately the first four were activated by the Air Corps between 1927 and 1933 in their original designations. On that date the Air Service consisted of 922 officers and 8,749 enlisted men, out of authorized personnel ceilings of 1,516 and 8,800. In 1925 the Tenth Annual Report of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, submitted by President Calvin Coolidge to the Congress on 8 December 1924, reported: > \\"The Air Service has 845 officers with rating as airplane pilots, airplane > observers, airship pilots, airship observers, or balloon observers.

Organizations above the group level were nonfunctional headquarters with no active command duties in peacetime, created as mobilization organizations without training responsibilities. Groups were headquarters personnel only, with squadrons nominally assigned over which they exercised limited control during training periods. Although assigned in plans to upper echelons, they were never organized as such components. To illustrate, on February 15, 1925: *the 11th Wing Headquarters (Attack) was located in Seattle, Washington; allotted to the Ninth Corps Area; assigned to the Sixth Army; nominally commanded by Lt. Col. Frank H. Patterson; and had the 310th Pursuit Group (Missouri), 309th Attack Group (Illinois), and the 312th Observation Groups (California) assigned; *the newly initiated 13th Wing Headquarters (Bombardment) was located in Baltimore, Maryland; allotted to the Third Corps Area; assigned to the General Headquarters Reserve (GHQR); commanded by Capt. Harold G. Slauson; and assigned the 347th Bombardment Group (Maryland, inactive) as a subordinate unit; *the 312th Observation Group (of the 11th Wing, described above), was located at Crissy Field, San Francisco, California; allotted to the Ninth Corps Area; commanded by 1st Lt. Stanley C. Kerk; and had the 420th (Michigan), 434th (Arizona), 440th (California), and 441st (California) Observation Squadrons assigned; and *the 36th Division Air Service was located at Ellington Field, Texas; allotted to the state of Texas (Eighth Corps Area); assigned to the 36th Division (VIII Corps); commanded by Major Bernard A. Law; and had the 111th Observation Squadron, the 111th Photo Section, and the 171st Air Intelligence Section assigned. In June 1924 the Army created 31 school groups for the Organized Reserve and assigned them to the Zone of the Interior. Four were officially \\"organized\\" and remained so until September 1928, when all 31 were demobilized. Six of the other school groups were organized at some point during this period, four of which were on organized status on February 15, 1925. By the Army's rules of unit organization, the headquarters of a National Guard division could not stand up until at least 75 percent of its subordinate units had been Federally recognized. By the end of 1924, 13 of the 18 National Guard division headquarters (under which divisional air services were organized) had been initiated, after which reduced Army budgets resulted in a two-year suspension of Federal recognition of new units. National Guard aviation had 14 observation squadrons on February 15, 1925, in contrast to the Organized Reserve, which had 73 pursuit squadrons, 21 attack squadrons, and 18 observation squadrons assigned to its groups. However, in keeping with then- current legislation, National Guard units were allowed full manning (although at the time of mobilization for World War II the Guard as a whole was only at 50% strength), while O.R. units could have 100% of their authorized officer complements but no more than 33% of their enlisted strength, thus keeping most (including aviation squadrons) in a largely \\"on paper only\\" condition.

Walter Ruben and starring Robert Montgomery and Rosalind Russell. It is based on The Suicide Club, a short story collection by Robert Louis Stevenson. A European prince, unhappy over an impending arranged marriage, finds intrigue at an unusual London club. Plot Prince Florizel of Corovia is unpleasantly surprised to learn that negotiations for his marriage to Princess Brenda of Irania are far advanced. He has not seen his intended bride since they were children, and at the time, he was not impressed. Luckily for him, Brenda is equally unwilling to marry him, likening it to \\"buying a pig in a poke\\". However, his father, the King, reminds him of his duty and their somewhat precarious position; only three years earlier, a revolution was suppressed, and the ringleaders are still at large. The King sends his son to London to think things over, accompanied by Colonel Geraldine. Traveling incognito, Florizel meets a mysterious woman, Miss Vandeleur, aboard the ship bound for London. She asks him to keep an envelope and return it to her after they arrive. Intrigued, he intervenes when a menacing man enters her cabin to demand the papers, but waits in vain for her at the dock. Geraldine is suspicious and opens the envelope; they find only sheets of blank paper. In London, they are dining at a restaurant when a young man enters with servants bearing trays of cream tarts and asks a woman patron to eat one. Suspicious, she refuses, so he consumes it himself. When the man asks Florizel, the prince not only accepts, he asks him to dinner to hear his story. The man, Cecil Barnley, confesses to having frivolously squandered his fortune and has embarked on one last silly lark before ending his life at the secret Suicide Club, which arranges deaths in such a manner as to avoid embarrassing its members or their families. Intrigued, Florizel pretends that both he and Geraldine also want to commit suicide and persuades Barnley to take them to the club. They are scrutinized before being admitted by its president. Inside, Florizel is surprised to find Miss Vandeleur, the sole woman in a roomful of men. The president then deals each person a card: the one who gets the ace of spades is to be killed by the one dealt the ace of clubs. On this night, it is determined that Barnley is to be dispatched by Miss Vandeleur following the instructions of the president. Forizel remains unconvinced that what they saw was real. The next morning, however, the newspaper reports Barnley's death. Disbelieving that the girl is a murderer, Florizel returns that night. This time, Miss Vandeleur is chosen to do away with Florizel. She takes him to the zoo to be torn apart by a lion. However, she is unable to go through with it. She confesses that she convinced Barnley to continue living and gave him some money to go to Paris. Just then someone shoots at the prince and they flee to an inn. Miss Vandeleur tells him that only the president knew where they were going. She reveals she is Princess Brenda and that she had recognized him aboard the ship. The next day, Florizel and Geraldine are captured by a ruse arranged by the club president, who is actually Dr. Franz Noel, a Corovian exiled for treason. Noel had created the Suicide Club as a means of income, only to be surprised by Florizel's arrival. Noel sentences Florizel to hang for treason. Florizel escapes, but Geraldine does not. Noel offers to spare his prisoner's life if Florizel will come alone to a duel to the death. Florizel accepts, but recruits some military officers with a spirit for adventure to follow him using a bloodhound. As suspected, Noel has no intention of dueling, but Florizel's men capture Noel's cabal. The prince offers Noel an actual duel, using swords. If Noel wins, his people will be released; however, Florizel emerges the victor. Shortly after, the prince and princess are \\"introduced\\" to each other at the court of Corovia.

Going into the 2010 FEI World Equestrian Games (WEG), Moorlands Totilas and his rider, Edward Gal, had amassed multiple world-record scores in international competition, leading one American journalist to call them \\"rock stars in the horse world\\". Totilas was retired from competition in August 2015. Show career Totilas was bred by Jan K. Schuil and Anna Schuil-Visser in Broeksterw√¢ld (Broeksterwoude) in the Netherlands. They gave him his basic training. Upon entering major competition at age five, he was ridden by Jiska van den Akker and exhibited at the 2005 World Breeding Championships for Young Horses at Verden, Germany. There he distinguished himself as the best horse from the Netherlands, and placed fourth in the final ranking of five-year-old dressage horses.2005 World Championships for Young Dressage Horses: Total Pleasure with Totilas, eurodressage.com, July 4, 2005‚ÄúOm de Trakehner te eren‚Äù (Dutch article about Totilas and his breeders) Also in 2005, his owners contacted Edward Gal and asked him to ride and compete Totilas. In 2006, after Gal began working with the horse, his sponsors Cees (also spelled Kees) and Tosca Visser purchased Totilas in the name of their investment company, Moorland BV. After this purchase the horse competed under the name \\"Moorlands Totilas\\". Totilas was ridden throughout most of his international Grand Prix career by Gal, under the flag of the Netherlands. Gal first began working with Toto in 2006 and the pair started to compete in 2008. Gal and the team of people who worked with the horse understood that Toto was \\"something special\\" after their first Grand Prix (GP) competition, with Gal later stating, \\"He has an incredible amount of talent; it‚Äôs simply a pleasure to ride him.\\"\\"Moorlands Totilas\\".Edward Gal.com Accessed 2010-10-17 In July 2009, Gal and Toto broke Anky van Grunsven's world record score in Grand Prix Freestyle Search fields: Competitor = Gal, Administering NF (National Federation) = NED (Netherlands), Gender=Male with an 89.50% mark at Hickstead, England, and shortly thereafter followed it up breaking their own record with a score of 90.75% at the 2009 FEI European Jumping and Dressage Championships. In December 2009, at the fourth leg of the 2009‚Äì10 FEI World Cup Dressage series at Olympia in London, they extended their record in GP Freestyle to 92.30%, more than 10 points above the second-place finisher. They won that season's FEI World Cup final with a win in GP Freestyle at home in the Netherlands, winning by more than 7 points with a score better than their first world record. The pair also have a world-record score in the Grand Prix Special discipline to their credit, having recorded 86.460% at Aachen in July 2010. The horse is not free of controversy, particularly due to his training using the highly controversial \\"LDR\\" (Low, deep and round) hyperflextion training technique also known as Rollkur, which faces claims of causing physical harm to the horse, and is considered \\"mental abuse\\" by the FEI. Critics claim his extravagant paces are anything but natural, but rather a product of harmful training. Thus, the critics accuse Totilas' trainers of artificially inflating dressage scores and corrupting the fundamentals of the sport. One German equestrian magazine compared his performances to those in a circus. While the head of the World Cup judging panel at the Olympia competition in London dismissed such criticism, saying, ‚ÄúPeople should be big enough to recognise brilliance when they see it.\\" While some give primary credit to the skill of Edward Gal as the primary reason the horse has reached such a high level at a very young age for a dressage horse, and at least one writer has wondered if Toto's success is because he is a Gemini, Anne Gribbons, dressage technical adviser for the United States Equestrian Federation, assesses the horse as having simply taken the sport to a new level: \\"He is capable of such power and balance while he's in motion that it is almost beyond what most other horses can do.\\" The pair were triple gold medalists at the 2010 FEI World Equestrian Games, becoming the first horse- rider partnership ever to sweep the three available dressage gold medals at a single FEI World Games. The Netherlands‚Äô Edward Gal rode Totilas to gold medals at the 2010 Alltech FEI World Equestrian Games (Ky.) before the stallion was sold to Schockem√∂hle and Linsenhof in late 2010. Totilas has since been plagued by injuries, missing out on the 2012 London Olympic Games and 2014 World Games (France). Totilas was retired in 2015 August, after results came back from a recent MRI, showing the horse has bone inflammation in his left hind hoof.

Totilas also suffered an injury during the winter. However, Rath and Totilas were pointed to compete in the 2012 Olympics and placed in the top three at the 2012 German Championships. However, shortly after, Rath developed a serious case of mononucleosis which caused him to withdraw from competition at CHIO Aachen in June and ultimately from the German Olympic team. While initially there was talk that Rath could compete in spite of missing Aachen, the possibility gave rise to charges of favoritism as two members of the German dressage committee, Klaus Roeser and Ullrich Kasselmann, have close business ties to Schockem√∂hle.Befangenheit und andere Probleme bei Totilas-Entscheidung  STERN.DE However, a downturn in Rath's health and orders of his doctors to not compete settled the matter. Rath expressed hope the pair would both be sound and healthy enough to compete in the 2016 Olympics, though by that time Totilas will be 16 years old.Rath And Totilas Out Of 2012 London Olympic Games  The Chronicle of the Horse Following the withdrawal of the pair, they moved to the Netherlands to work with Sjef Janssen, coach of the Dutch team and of gold medalist Anky van Grunsven, presumably to obtain experience the training techniques that Totilas was familiar with while in the care of Gal. Allegations of abuse arose soon after the pair's 2011 performance in Rotterdam. A public showing where Totilas stuck out his tongue while performing, viewed as a sign of stress, caused public concern. Further controversy arose in October 2012, when the German branch of PETA filed a legal complaint against Rath, Schockem√∂hle and Lisenhoff, alleging that Totilas was being abused due to the use of rollkur in his training and management that kept him confined in a box stall, isolated from other horses. PETA alleges the horse's treatment violates the free-movement requirements of the German Federal Ministry of Food, Agriculture, and Consumer Protection. However, prosecutors have yet to determine if PETA's allegations are sufficient to allege an actual violation of German law. As the bulk of the complaint focuses on the issue of Rollkur training, which PETA is attempting to ban in Germany (though it is already prohibited by the German Equestrian Federation), the charge is viewed within the dressage community as a means by which to bring the issue to public attention via a high-profile case.  Pedigree  Moorlands Totilas is sired by a Trakehner stallion, Gribaldi that was approved by KWPN, the Dutch Warmblood registry, and noted for elegance and refinement. Gribaldi had also been shown at the Grand Prix level by Edward Gal.Battram, Simon. \\"The magic of Moorlands Totilas\\" Stepintodressae.com, accessed 2010-10-18 Toto's dam, Lominka, a KWPN approved Dutch Warmblood, comes from bloodlines that have produced both show jumping and dressage horses, many of whom were noted for good temperament.

The coastline is characterised by low cliffs alternating with sandy beaches. Large ponds lie inside two of the beaches. Dog Island lies west of the Prickley Pear Cays. Flora and fauna The central part of the island is covered in thorny scrub with prickly pear. The island, with the adjacent cays, has been identified as an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International because it is home to large numbers of nesting seabirds, mainly sooty terns with over 100,000 pairs recorded. Other seabirds breeding in smaller numbers include red-billed tropicbirds, magnificent frigatebirds, masked and brown boobies, laughing gulls, bridled terns and brown noddies.

Etymology The specific name \\"perla\\", used as a noun in apposition, simultaneously refers to the pearly white bar-colouring on the body and to the Pearl Islands, where the three type specimens were collected. Description Based on the extremely limited sample available, males of this species are known to reach a maximum length of approximately SL while females are known to reach approximately . The blennies are primarily brown and yellow in colour, also displaying the aforementioned white stripes. The eyes of the blenny possess pale irises with yellow or rusty lines stemming from the pupils, and pale blue dots underneath the eye sockets and around the jaws. P. perla shares the radiating lines in its eyes with its sister species P. bicirrus and P. punctata, a trait Hastings describes as being possibly unique to members of Protemblemaria. As is typical of the genus, P. perla possesses fleshy ridges between the eyes and the snout. Hastings theorizes that Protemblemaria perla is most closely related to its southern Caribbean sister taxon P. punctata. Distribution The full extent of the distribution of Protemblemaria perla is uncertain, as it is only known from two male and a single female specimen collected from Isla del Rey, Pearl Islands, Panama, in the eastern central Pacific Ocean.

Zodiac Nautic finds its origins in the ‚ÄúZodiac airships and aviation French company‚Äù, specialized in the production of airships. In the 1930s Pierre Debroutelle, one of its engineers, invented one of the first prototypes of inflatable boats for the A√©ronavale, who were looking for innovative and easy solution for military transport. This change from air to sea brought worldwide recognition to Zodiac. In the 1960s, the company turned to the leisure industry to accommodate the ‚Äúvacationers‚Äù and their growing interest in recreational boating. With a history of unrivalled experience, Zodiac Nautic‚Äôs origin is closely tied to all major innovations in the sector of inflatable boats.OpenGate Capital Signs Agreement to Acquire Zodiac Recreational from Zodiac Marine & Pool In financial trouble, the company was sold to private owners in 2015.FLIBS 2015: Zodiac Nautic president maps out brand‚Äôs revival  Zodiac boat  Made with an inflatable buoyancy tube and a rigid hull, these boats combine the advantages of traditional inflatable boats ‚Äì security, stability, portability, and ease of use ‚Äì with those of rigid-hulled boats ‚Äì comfort, agility and speed. Its unique combination of a very low center of gravity, a deep-V hull and added stabilization of the tubes which gives the rigid hulled inflatable speed and sea-crossing capacities without compromising comfort or safety. The Zodiac boat has an exceptional weight / area-below- water ratio, giving the boat a load-bearing capacity such that it can carry considerable loads. The buoyancy is distributed on the sides, the center of gravity is very low: this makes it much harder to capsize the vessel. The buoyancy tubes of Zodiac boats have several compartments, separated by waterproof partitions. Thanks to its important air reserves, the boat keeps its ability to float and stays conceptually unsinkable when fully loaded, even with a deflated compartment. Zodiac inflatable boats are commonly used by the United States Military, however, these are Zodiac Milpro (Military and Professional) boats, which is a separate company also created during the breakup of the Zodiac Group in 2007. Zodiac boats were brought into American popular culture in the late 1960s. They were ubiquitous in the popular television documentary series, The Undersea World of Jacques Cousteau.

The Stone Distillery has a dominating presence in the Distillery District, owing largely to its massive size and materials. The 300 by building is an outstanding representation of Victorian industrial architecture, while also echoing ancient Florentine architecture. Each storey in the main building is separated by a course of stone, and the larger first floor and square windows seat it firmly to the ground. The simple facade is punctuated by a rhythmic pattern of windows separated by circular iron tie plates. The entire building is also tied together by a simple colour scheme of warm grey limestone with dark green accents on the windows, doors, and other ornamentation. History In 1869, an explosion in the fermenting cellar caused a massive fire to engulf the building, destroying the wooden interior, but leaving the stone and machinery largely undamaged. The building was reconstructed and reopened in May 1870.Gibson, Sally. ‚ÄúGreat Fire of ‚Äò69.‚Äù Distillery District Heritage Website, 21 October 2007. Web. 16 October 2010.

When she was in her teens her father became head of the State Department's Far Eastern Department was transferred back to Washington, D.C. and for the first time she left Japan and went to the United States. Miller attended the Central High School in Washington, D.C. and at the age of 14 won first prize for a Washington Post art contest with Early Morning in Old Japan.\\"These are the prize winning pictures in last week's drawing contest.\\" Washington Post.

Adulthood Then she went to Seoul, Korea in 1918, where her father was now the American Consul General. She was a journalist and secretary at the State Department in Washington, D.C. Miller then lived with her parents in New York and worked at the Consular Service. She was a clerk and confidential secretary at the American Embassy in 1920.1920 New York, Consular Service, Military and Naval Forces; Roll: T625_2041; Page: 2A; Enumeration District: Consular Service; Image: 1247.

She was in financial ruin after the Great Kanto earthquake of September 1, 1923, when many of her prints and paintings were destroyed. Miller lived with her parents in Seoul, Korea from 1923 until 1927 or 1928. While in Korea, Miller made prints and recuperated over a long period of time from a serious illness. In 1930 Miller returned to Japan and moved to Kyoto. Her father returned to the U.S. and became head of the Far Eastern Department in the State Department, Washington.Paolo E. Coletta, William Jennings Bryan, vol. 2 Lincoln, NE: University of Nebraska Press, 1964. p. 222. He died in 1932 and his remains were buried at Yokohama Foreign Cemetery.Kendall H. Brown; Lilian Miller; Pacific Asia Museum. Between two worlds: the life and art of Lilian Miller. Pacific Asia Museum; 1998. . In 1935, Miller had surgery for a large cancerous tumor and a hysterectomy. In early 1936, after a political imbroglio in which Japanese radical officers assassinated several leading politicians, Miller and her mother left Japan and moved to Honolulu, Hawaii. In the autumn of 1938 she moved to San Francisco and she began to include the massive redwoods and cedars of California in her work. In her personal life she hiked California's San Gabriel Mountains and wandered through Alaska. She lived a life of contradictions. Miller wore kimonos when she showed her work - which reflected her east Asian upbringing - but also wore men's clothes and called herself \\"Jack\\". The kimono represented the Japanese traditional culture in which she was raised, but she didn't follow the strict protocols for developing wood block printing, this was something that made her popular with Americans. Her parents were from the United States, but she lived most of her life in Asia. She is assumed to have been a lesbian and once said that she didn't have the ability to make herself fall in love with a man.Katrina Gulliver. Modern Women in China and Japan: Gender, Feminism and Global Modernity Between the Wars. I.B.Tauris; 15 March 2012. . pp. 3, 116-127. Following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, she destroyed much of her woodprint works, having felt betrayed by Japan. During the war, Miller worked against the Japanese. She signed on with a Naval counter propaganda branch as a Japanese Censor and Research Analyst. On December 9, 1942 she had surgery to remove a large malignant tumor at a hospital at Stanford University. She died on January 11, 1943 of abdominal cancer in California. Her ashes were buried at Woodland Cemetery in San Francisco, California. Art=Painting After her Vassar graduation, she returned to Japan to study from 1917 to 1918 with Shimada Bokusen. While in Tokyo, Miller received recognition for her ink painting of Queen Min's Gyeongbok Palace pavilion entitled In a Korean Palace Garden in 1920. She received an award at the Japanese Imperial Salon for the work. In the 1930s, during the Great Depression, Miller evolved to a new style of popular watercolor painting. She made over 100 watercolor paintings, usually working outdoors. Woodblock printing Miller made Shin-hanga woodblock prints, a 20th-century version of traditional Ukiyo-e prints, or pictures of the floating world, which were popular beginning in the 1700s. Because they were prints they were readily available and inexpensive artworks. Edmond and Jules de Goncourt created greater interest in Japanese work as an art form in the late 19th century, partly through Edmond's books Outamaro and Hokousai. They first identified the cultural movement of Japonisme. Of the western women who began making shin-hanga wood prints, or \\"creative prints\\", Miller was the only one born in the orient. The others, who had all lived in Japan, were Helen Hyde, who first made the Japanese prints in 1901, Elizabeth Keith and Bertha Lum. The shin-hanga prints included scenes from the contemporary world, like western dress and electricity.Katrina Gulliver. Modern Women in China and Japan: Gender, Feminism and Global Modernity Between the Wars. I.B.Tauris; 15 March 2012. . pp. 115-116. Woodblock print production was traditionally a team effort, led by the artist's direction. Several woodblocks were cut from the artist's sketch and watercolor painting, each woodblock for a specific color. Then a printer would make prints by pressing the woodblock with its associated colored ink onto paper. Miller did the work herself, creating the initial image and woodcuts and making the prints.Katrina Gulliver. Modern Women in China and Japan: Gender, Feminism and Global Modernity Between the Wars. I.B.Tauris; 15 March 2012. . p. 116. In September 1920 she turned to woodblock printing, creating images of Korean people and countryside, which she sold in T≈çky≈ç and the United States. She was living as the tenant of the artist and promoter Bertha B. Lum (1869‚Äì1954). Miller began to work with the block-carver Matsumoto, who had previously worked for Helen Hyde, and the printer Nishimura Kumakichi (1861 ‚Äì ca. 1941), whom Bertha Lum relied on for her own print productions. Shortly thereafter there was a dramatic falling-out between the two artists. Miller also struggled with a relationship with Elizabeth Keith, who began as a friend but later developed into a rival.Kendall H. Brown. \\"Lilian Miller, An Artist in Japan\\" Impressions #28, 2006. From 1920, she made her living as a print-maker. The images, mostly of scenes of Korean life, were sold in Tokyo, Seoul, large American cities, Shanghai, and Peking. Many of Miller's prints were produced on post cards. On September 1, 1923 T≈çky≈ç was largely destroyed by the Great Kant≈ç earthquake, including most of Miller's paintings and prints. Miller was in Korea from 1923 to 1927. During that time she produced more stylized prints. Miller made prints of domestic scenes, like children at play or women hanging laundry. One of her prints, A Strange Scene in Korea, depicted a woman carrying a baby on her back with a basket over her head. Another is entitled, Korean Farm House under the Moonlight with a man talking to a woman with a basket over her head. Lilian May Miller, Rain Blossoms, color woodprint, 1928In Rain Blossoms that Miler made in 1928, the colorful umbrellas, or 'blossoms', are contrasted against the plain background of the people's bodies. Willow trees and the bridge are traditional Oriental motifs. It is considered a \\"beautiful example of Miller's work\\". Other prints were Nikko Gateway, Makaen Monastery and Festival of Lanterns. Most of her works were scenes of Japan. Lilian made a six-month visit to the United States in 1929 and 1930 and gave woodblock printing demonstrations at galleries and museums in Boston, New York City, Philadelphia, Washington, Chicago, Kansas City, Denver, San Francisco, and Pasadena. During her lectures, exhibitions and one-woman shows, she wore an elaborate kimono. Miller was admired for her ability to execute the entire woodblock printing process, including the block- cutting stage, by herself. Her works were then in the collections of the Art Institute of Chicago and the British Museum. In the 1937 exhibition of the Honolulu Print Makers, she exhibited a print depicting bamboo using a lithotint method, a kind of lithography, that achieved the effect of ink painting. It was entitled A Spray of Bamboo and won the sixth annual gift print prize. Female patrons and collectors She had a network of key female art patrons and admirers of the time, including Empress Nagako of Japan; Lou Henry Hoover, the wife of U.S. president Herbert Hoover; Anne Morrow Lindbergh aviatix and spouse of famous Charles Lindbergh; and Grace Nicholson, a renowned Pasadena art dealer. It was Nicholson's Pasadena residence, now the Pacific Asia Museum, where Miller perhaps felt most at home‚Äîoutside Japan. Their friendship enabled Miller to meet and make use of many important art contacts on her American trip and afterwards. Collections Her work Moonlight on Mt. Fuji, Japan is in the collections of the Smithsonian American Art Museum. Poetry In 1927, Miller published a revised version of her poetry book Grass Blades from a Cinnamon Garden, which was illustrated with her woodcut prints. Author Kendall H. Brown stresses the visual quality of many of the poems, and concludes that while \\"her poetry was often flat and contrived, her art was becoming increasingly radiant and natural.\\" A number of the poems in the volume are ardent expressions of love addressed, it seems, to women, and Brown remarked: \\"The feminized Orient, alternately maternal and sexual, is easily linked to the desired lover who is at once the gentle teacher and the object of amorous desire. Thus, the Orient becomes the lover and the lover becomes the Orient, both ideal states of grace and sites of feminine creativity.\\"Kendal H. Brown. (1998) Between Two Worlds: The Life and Art of Lilian May Miller (first edition). Pasadena: Pacific Asia Museum; an illustrated edition was published by University of Washington Press, 2000). Posthumous recognition Miller's painting and prints, as well as those of Bertha Lum, Elizabeth Keith and Helen Hyde were exhibited in the June 2012 show \\"Visions of the Orient\\" of 125 paintings and prints at the Schnitzer Museum of Art at the University of Oregon.

Before 1815 In 1777, the Russian troops located at Kizlyar and along the entire borderline of the Terek River were formed into a body subordinate to the governor of Astrakhan. Into this corps were subsumed the Karbadian and Gorski jaeger battalions from the garrison of Kizlyar, and one battalion of the garrison of the town of Mozdok. In 1779, this body was strengthened with the arrival at Astrakhan of the Selege, Tomsk, and Ladoga infantry regiments. In the autumn of 1782, this body, having been further strengthened in the meantime, was named the Novolineyny Corps, and then soon renamed the Caucasus Corps. By then, the Corps consisted of 22 infantry battalions, 20 squadrons of dragoons, and four batteries of artillery (30 guns). In early 1796, the Tsarina Catherine II, having decided to declare war on Persia, ordered that the Corps be strengthened with the addition of four infantry regiments, 3 legkokonnymi regiments, and one Cossack regiment. The troops chosen to participate in the Persian Expedition of 1796 were organized into the Caspian Corps under Count Zubov. This Corps consisted of six battalions of grenadiers, twelve battalions of musketeers, seven jaeger battalions, and 45 squadrons of cavalry. After the death of Catherine, her successor Paul I halted military operations against Persia and withdrew all the troops stationed on the Caspian and in Georgia back into Russia. In November 1796, an Imperial Order established a reorganization of all regiments. The troops were formed into 12 divisions, and soon renamed the Inspectorate. Troops stationed in the Caucasus became the Tenth Caucasian Division. The Caspian Corps was disbanded and its troops reassigned to organizations which had been withdrawn into the internal provinces of Russia. In 1801, at time of the accession to the throne of Tsar Alexander I, the troops in the Caucasian Inspectorate consisted of 15 infantry battalions, 20 squadrons of dragoons, and 5 artillery batteries. 1815 to 1857 On December 21, 1815, by Imperial Order, the troops of the 19th and 20th divisions, located on the Caucasian border, in Georgia, and in the Transcaucasian region in general, were formed into a separate Georgia Corps. In early 1819, the commander in Georgia, General Ermolov, requested a strengthening of the forces in the region. Tsar Alexander I did not feel able to do this on a permanent basis, but on April 19 sent ten regiments as a temporary reinforcement. In August 1820, an Imperial Order was issued decreeing that some troops in the Georgia Corps be formed into a separate Caucasus Corps. 1857 to 1865: Caucasus Army On December 6, 1857, the Caucasus Corps was renamed the Caucasus Army, and the post of Chief of the Caucasus Army General Staff was created. In August 1865, the Caucasus Military District was created, and the general staff of the Caucasus Army was abolished, although the army was not formally abolished in name until 1881.

While in this position, she gained significant influence over Twain's personal and business affairs. Twain fired her in 1909 for reasons that remain in dispute. Mark Twain's secretary Lyon was born in Tarrytown, New York, to a well-off family. Her father's early death plunged the family into poverty, and Lyon became a governess. She became acquainted with Twain in the 1890s and often played whist with him. In 1902, Twain hired Lyon as a secretary because his wife, Olivia, was becoming too ill to handle his correspondence. After Olivia's death in 1904, Lyon moved into Twain's house and assisted him with his autobiography. She also disbursed allowances to Twain's daughters Clara and Jean. Lyon helped to supervise the construction of Stormfield, Twain's estate in Redding, Connecticut, and managed the property afterwards. Twain bought Lyon a house, called The Lobster Pot, near Stormfield to keep her close by. Twain's trust in Lyon caused him to grant her a power of attorney in 1907. Dismissal In March 1909, Lyon married Ralph Ashcroft, a business associate of Twain. At about this time, Twain allegedly began to suspect Lyon of using her position to help herself to his money, particularly for remodeling her house. He also alleged that Lyon was scheming to marry him. It has been suggested that Clara, an aspiring singer, turned Twain against Lyon out of fear that Lyon would expose Clara's extramarital affair with her married accompanist. Another author has said that Twain's charges were accurate and that Lyon was trying to isolate Twain from his daughters, especially Jean, who was epileptic and dependent on Twain for support. Twain fired Lyon in April 1909 and forced her to return the property, called The Lobster Pot, that he had given her. Twain was bitter over the affair; he denounced Lyon as \\"a liar, a forger, a thief, a hypocrite, a drunkard, a sneak, a humbug, a traitor, a conspirator, a filthy-minded & salacious slut pining for seduction.\\" He wrote a 429-page manuscript outlining his complaints against Lyon and Ashcroft. This \\"Ashcroft-Lyon Manuscript\\" was kept private by Twain with his intention being to publish it if Lyon were to go public with details of the relationship. It was published in 2015 as part of the third volume of Twain's autobiography. Later years Lyon and Ashcroft moved to Canada and divorced in 1927, after which Lyon moved to New York and resumed work as a secretary. She seldom spoke of her years with Twain, but she met regularly with Hal Holbrook, who was developing his one-man show Mark Twain Tonight. Lyon died of a heart attack in her Greenwich Village apartment on December 4, 1958, two weeks before her 95th birthday.

Early life Sylvester Hill was born in North Kingstown, Rhode Island but moved to Ohio in 1840. He settled in Cincinnati and was employed in the lumber business until 1849. Hill took part on the California Gold Rush but failed to achieve any profit there. He traveled back eastward and settled in Muscatine, Iowa.History of Iowa Civil War Hill was in Iowa when the Civil War began.

Hill was wounded at the battles of Pleasant Hill and Yellow Bayou in 1864. He returned to regimental command at the Battle of Tupelo but was back in command of the 3rd Brigade during Price's Missouri Raid. Battle of Nashville Hill's final engagement came in December 1864 at the Battle of Nashville. On the first day of the battle Hill led his brigade against the Confederates on Montgomery Hill and was killed instantly from artillery fire from Redoubt No. 2. He was posthumously given a brevet promotion to brigadier general for his service at Nashville.Eicher, 2001, p. 748 indicates that President Abraham Lincoln nominated Hill for appointment to the grade of brevet Brigadier General of volunteers on December 12, 1864 to rank from December 15, 1864 and that the U.S. Senate confirmed the appointment on February 14, 1865.

He was crowned in 1715 after the death of his brother, Mirwais Hotak. He is the father of Ashraf Hotak, the fourth ruler of the Hotak dynasty. Abdul Aziz was killed in 1717 by his nephew Mahmud Hotak. Early life Abdul Aziz was born in a well known, rich and political family in the Kandahar area. His family was involved in social and community services since long ago. He was the son of Salim Khan and Nazo Tokhi (also known as \\"Nazo Anaa\\"), grandson of Karum Khan and great grandson of Ismail Khan, a descendant of Malikyar, the ancient head of Hottaki or Hotaks. The Hottaki is a strong branch of Ghilji, one of the main tribes among the Pashtun people. Hajji Amanullah Hottak reports in his book that the Ghilji tribe is the original residents of Ghor or Gherj. This tribe migrated later to obtain lands in southeastern Afghanistan and multiplied in these areas.http://www.beepworld.de/members4/wolas/mirwaisneeka.htm Greater Kandahar (Candahar) during the Safavid dynasty and Mughal period. In 1707, Kandahar was in a state of chaos due to it being fought for control by the Shi'a Persian Safavids and the Sunni Moghuls of India. Mirwais Khan, a Sunni tribal chief whose influence with his fellow-countrymen made him an object of suspicion, was held as a political prisoner by the Safavid governor over the region, Gurgin Khan, and sent to the Safavids court at Isfahan. He was later released and even allowed to meet with the Shah, Sultan Husayn, on a regular bases. Having sown this seed of false trust and having completely ingratiated himself with the Persian Court, Mirwais sought and obtained permission to perform the pilgrimage to Mecca in Ottoman empire. He had studied carefully all the military weaknesses of the by then heavily declined Safavids while he spent time there in their court. It was in 1709 when Mirwais and Abdul Aziz began organizing his countrymen for a major uprising, and when a large part of the Persian garrison was on an expedition outside the city, followers of Mirwais and Abdul Aziz fell on the remainder and killed the greater number of them, including Gurgin Khan. The Pashtun tribes rankled under the ruling Safavids because of their continued attempts to forcefully convert them from Sunni to Shia Islam. After Gurgin Khan and his escort were killed during a picnic in April 1709, the Hotak tribe took control of the city and the province. The Pashtun rebels then defeated a large Qizilbash and Persian army, sent to gain control over the area. Death Abdul Aziz wanted to make a peace treaty with the Persians but his country men were opposed to this idea so they forced Mahmud Hotak to murder him in 1717. In the same year he got succeeded by Mahmud Hotak. Abdul Aziz is buried at a mausoleum next to his brother in the Kokaran section of Kandahar City in Afghanistan.

Ruaidri O'Flaherty is in generation 111 in the lineage of the O'Flahertys, as cited in O'Hart. Muireadhach's immediate descendants adopted the surname Mac Aedha. The surname is now rendered McHugh or Hughes, less commonly McGagh (better reflecting the Irish pronunciation). Genealogy * Genealach Mec Aodha/The genealogy of Mac Aodha: Donnchadh s.

In both 2008 and 2009 his team fell just one game short of a grand final appearance, losing in the preliminary finals in both years to the Canberra Raiders and subsequently the Wests Tigers.

He's been a great assistant to me and he's got the respect of everybody there in the playing group so I'm elated for him. \\"It's the way it should work.\\" \\"He knows what works. He's seen it now, he's lived it,\\" Bennett said. \\"He'll have his personality, put his own pieces to it, but the end result is he knows what works.\\" \\"There is no reason why he should be daunted by the task.\\" \\"I wouldn't be if I was his age.\\" \\"When I came to the Dragons there was only two staff that I kept here and he was one of them,\\" Bennett said. \\"I made a few inquiries and everywhere I went, the ex- players and current players, they all had a wrap on him. I'm as confident as I can be about anybody.\\" NRL head coach Upon Price taking over the head coaching role, replacement staff were immediately hired to fill the void left by staff leaving with Wayne Bennett to the Newcastle Knights.

Lyndon's mother then changed the family name to her maiden name and he moved to Gillingham School where he faced having to leave to get a job following completion of his O-levels due to the family's financial situation. Instead, his tutor Frank Hodgson paid the family money so Lyndon could complete his A-levels. Lyndon became head-boy and later set up the Frank Hodgson Trust for the school, providing similar financial support for sixth-form students. One of the ten houses at the school is also named after Lyndon.; As a teenager he was interested in progressive causes, he joined the Young Communist League as well as the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. According to a newspaper article written by Lyndon, he became, in 1965, the first student from a comprehensive school to be awarded an unconditional place at Cambridge University where he attended Queens' College.

Lyndon also make television appearances, including as a guest on a famous episode of Channel Four show After Dark. On gender issues Lyndon first focused on gender issues in a 1990 essay for The Sunday Times Magazine entitled \\"Badmouthing\\". The 5,000-word piece argued that, in advertising, entertainment, the news media, family law, education and health research, \\"an atmosphere of intolerance surrounded men\\", blaming this intolerance on \\"the universal dominance of feminism\\". Lyndon concluded the piece stating: \\"If relations between men, women and children are to improve, attitudes to men and manhood must change. It wouldn‚Äôt be a bad start if men caused to be the butt of casual prejudice expressed in half-witted habits of speech. But the most important job our legislators face must be to remove some of the systemic disadvantages of life for men to improve their position within the family and within society at large. There is one sense in which men, as a group and a whole, can be described as a class in Britain: in a host of vital ways they second class citizens.\\" It later emerged that female writers at The Times had allegedly made an unsuccessful attempt to have Lyndon's article censored, so the women instead wrote a derogatory article about Lyndon in the Sunday Times Magazine's \\"Style\\" section.London Charivari, (Punch), Volume 300, 1991 No More Sex War The following year he wrote his book, No More Sex War: The Failures of Feminism, published in 1992, in which he expanded on these arguments. =Reception= The work received a large amount of attention in the media,Christina Hardyment, \\"Book Review: A wounded Apollo lashes back: No more Sex War ‚Äì Neil Lyndon\\", The Independent, 3 October 1992 some of it hostile and abusive, vilifying Lyndon. Rather than addressing the issues and arguments raised by Lyndon, many critics instead chose to make verbal personal attacks. They suggested he was sexually inadequate, questioned the size of his penis, his masculinity, his ability to attract women and even the smell of his breath. Almost two decades later feminist writer Julie Burchill continued the verbal personal attack, suggesting he was a \\"sad-sack\\" and \\"the opposite of a man\\". According to Lyndon, in one review of books of the year, Helena Kennedy refused to even discuss the publication, simply instructing people not to buy it. =Impact= The book sold few copies and Lyndon's work in journalism dried up. In August 1992 he was declared bankrupt.Jim White, \\"Back in the fray\\", The Guardian, 15 December 2000 Before the publication of No More Sex War, Lyndon's marriage had broken up and his wife had taken their child to Scotland where, according to Lyndon, she obtained an order of custody without Lyndon knowing the case was being heard. Also according to Lyndon, in the subsequent divorce, his media notoriety was used against him in court, and he lost all access to his son. He rebuilt his career in journalism during the 1990s, and was later reunited with his son, who lived with him in Scotland before going to university. Lyndon also claimed he was assaulted at Heathrow Airport because of his book. He claimed in 2000 that at Cambridge University, his alma mater, a president of Cambridge Union encouraged members to burn his writings, and that a university don told her students that she would like to see him shot. Eight years after the controversy, Lyndon revisited some of the issues in his book and discussed his story. He highlighted the issues in relation to \\"the treatment of dissidents in what is supposed to be an open society\\". Whilst not comparing his plight to the coetaneous case of Salman Rushdie, he suggested it was \\"paradoxical that many of the people who defended Rushdie's right to write whatever he wanted should be so censorious and destructive about wanting to limit my freedom to do the same\\". Personal life Lyndon married his first wife Monica Foot in 1971 and they divorced five years later. He married his second wife Deirdre in 1977 with whom he had a son and gained a step-son. Following his separation from Deirdre she abducted his son and took him to Scotland and he was denied access to his child for two and a half years. Eventually, at age 15, Lyndon's son ran away from his alcoholic mother to live with his father He married his third wife Linda, a teacher. They have two daughters and live in Fife, Scotland.

It was selected in 2010 to power the Bombardier Global 7500/8000, first ran on June 24, 2013 and first flew in 2015. It was certified in April 2016 and powered the Global 7500 first flight on November 4, 2016, before its 2018 introduction. It produces of thrust, a range previously covered by the General Electric CF34. A smaller scaled CFM LEAP, it is a twin- spool axial engine with a 5.6:1 bypass ratio and a 45:1 overall pressure ratio and is noted for its large one-piece fan 18-blade titanium blisk. Development GE's eCore research program developing a common architecture for business, narrowbody and regional jets resulted in the CFM LEAP succeeding the CFM56 aboard the Boeing 737 MAX and Airbus A320neo. After a market study, GE pursued the long-range, large business jet and selected a thrust to exploit technology acquired for its commercial and military engine programs. Preliminary design work commenced in 2009. In 2010, Bombardier Aerospace selected the engine rated at for the Global 7000 announced at the same year NBAA convention. The testing of the engineering cores began in 2010, with a second core set to be ready in 2011. On May 16, 2011, the TechX was renamed the Passport. In 2011 began rig testing of components including combustor and high-pressure turbines. In 2012, to ensure containment by its shroud, a blade was blown off the fan. By 2013, multiple complete engines builds commenced testing on GE's Peebles, Ohio, outdoor stands. Bird ingestion and endurance were tested through 2014. In 2015, the Passport first flew aboard GE's Boeing 747-100 flying testbed out of Victorville, California, as ice, water ingestion and altitude up to FL510 were tested in a U.S. facility in Tennessee. In April 2016, it was FAA Certified after 3,380 hours and 3,385 cycles of testing. The Global 7000 made its maiden flight with it on November 4, 2016. It flew 100 hours on the Boeing 747 before logging more than 900 hours aboard the Global 7000 prototypes. By May 2017, the engines had completed 3,100h in ground and flight test. On 15 August 2017, the Global 7000 second prototype's right engine suffered an in-flight flameout at FL410, after ‚Äúhigh vibration and high inter-turbine temperature readings‚Äù; subsequently, the airplane returned to Wichita Airport (290 km away) for a single engine landing. It was traced to a mis-assembled part and a fleet-wide inspection revealed it was a one-off error. In autumn 2017, GE was building the flight test engines for Bombardier while preparing for early manufacturing. By service entry in 2018, 4,000 hours and 8,000 cycles of testing should be completed.  Design  engineering model at EBACE 2019 The engine is a twin-spool, axial-flow turbofan with a high bypass ratio of 5.6:1 and an overall pressure ratio of 45:1. The front fan is attached to the three-stage low-pressure compressor; the 23:1 pressure ratio 10-stage high-pressure compressor includes five blisk stages for weight reduction. The low-emission combustor has a case with integrated OGV diffuser for weight reduction. There is a two-stage high-pressure and four-stage low- pressure turbine. The engine and aircraft accessory drive extracts energy from the high-pressure, high-speed rotor. It is equipped with a dual-channel Full Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC) control system, providing fault isolation and engine functionality and diagnostics capability. A smaller scaled CFM LEAP, its HP compressor has five titanium blisks then five stages with insertable nickel alloy blades for higher temperatures. Its bleed air cooled turbine blades are made of advanced alloys from the eCore program. Blade tip active clearance control is modulated with cooling air from an enclosing manifold to the case, controlling its expansion and contraction depending on the flight envelope. The fan blisk, the first application of such technology on an engine this size, eliminates the need to balance a hub and blade system. Blisk fans are usually found in small GE Honda HF120 or Williams International turbofans but the Passport titanium blisk is larger than the GE90 first stage compressor blisk. The 18 highly twisted wide chord forged titanium blades are friction welded by translations to the hub. The one piece fan reduces the vibration for cabin comfort, lowers wear and maintenance due to fewer parts, is lighter by a third and improves performance with less leaks and a smaller hub. Fuselage-mounted business jet engines are high off the ground and shielded by the wing from most foreign object damage. Its blades are more damage-resistant by being thicker at the leading edges due to their great efficiency. The fan can be changed on-wing as a LRU to be evaluated for repair in the shop. Its core cowling, exhaust cone and mixer are made in ox-ox composites, with inorganic high-temperature-tolerant resins and oxide ceramics CMCs to withstand 1,000 ¬∞C without deformation, saving weight and allowing complex molding. The carbon fiber composite fan cowl can contain a separated fan blade. GE provides the whole nacelle including the thrust reverser. Developed with Safran, the slimline nacelle with clam-shell cowl openings reduce weight and drag. Its TSFC is 8% lower than the competing BR725 of the Gulfstream 650, and over 10% better than the BR710. GE's Strother Field plant in Arkansas City, Kansas, performs its final assembly.

It was founded in 1825 to promote and support art through public exhibitions, lectures, acquisitions of art works for distribution among the members, support of artists and publications on art. History Kunstforeningen was founded as a temporary society in 1825 by a circle of the most influential figures of the Danish art world during the Danish Golden Age. They were Johan Christian Fick, professors J. L. Lund, C. W. Eckersberg and G. F. Hetsch from the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts, the landscape painter J. P. M√∏ller, the art historian Niels Laurits H√∏yen and Just Mathias Thiele, the secretary of the Academy. In 1827, it became a more well- defined and active organization but by 1829 still had only 71 members. The purpose was to broaden the knowledge of art and to bridge the gap between the elite and a wider public. From the beginning, it also aimed to influence and not just support the Danish scene, probably prompted by H√∏yen. This was achieved by commissioning artworks, rather than just buying finished works, and through prize competitions. After opposition among members in 1835, this activist practice was toned down in 1835 and more focus was directed at the acquisition and redistribution among members. The society also funded various public artworks. The first public art exhibition was held in 1828 and featured 117 paintings by Jens Juel. In 1835, the society had grown to 1,100 and in the early 1860s it had reached 1,700 members. Weekly sessions were held at Hotel Du Nord, and from 1826 at the Freemasons Hall, while the exhibitions were held at the City Hall. Later the society's activities relocated several more times before finding their current base at Gammel Strand in 1952. Ever since, the focus has increasingly been on art exhibitions. On 26 September 2010, the building reopened after a major renovation. Building Kunstforeningen's building at Gammel Strand is a town house from 1750. It was designed by Philip de Lange. Kunstforeningen today Kunstforeningen hosts five exhibitions every year. The emphasis is on Danish and international contemporary art. One of the annual exhibitions is of works by the year's graduates from the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts. The building has a second entrance at the rear, at L√¶derstr√¶de 15, which is recommended for those in wheelchairs or with prams since it has an elevator providing direct access to all floors.

Gerdkuh is a \\"fortified mountain\\"‚Äîa high vertical rock of 300 m in height with buildings on its summit and fortifications at its sides, defended by a triple ring of fortifications at its foot, making the citadel impregnable to direct military assault. It was originally a small fort acquired and refortified in 1096 AD by a Seljuq commander who was secretly a Nizari. The fortress served as a place of refuge for the families of the Nizaris, and its strategic location in the middle of the Khorasan Road made it a useful base for collecting taxes from the passing caravans of the Silk Road. Gerdkuh resisted the Mongol invasion of 1253 AD for 17 years, becoming the last Nizari stronghold in Persia to fall. The fortress remained in use until the early Safavid period. Among the major Nizari fortresses, Gerdkuh is the least studied one. Name The word Girdk≈´hThe name is variously transliterated as Girdkuh (Girdk≈´h), Gerdkuh (Gerdk≈´h), Girdkoh (Girdk≈çh), Gird-i-Kuh (Gird-i-k≈´h), Gird-i-Koh (Gird-i-K≈çh). () is a compound of gird () for \\"circular\\" (round) and k≈´h () for \\"mountain\\". It is named this due to the circular shape of the mountain peak. In the Chinese work History of Yuan, Gerdkuh is recorded multiple times, as Y√º-r-gu, K‚Äòi-du-bu, K‚Äòi-du-bu-gu, and Gir-r-du-k‚Äòie, on top of the mount Yen-han, west of Tan-han (Damghan). The fortress is called Tigado by Hayton of Corycus. The fortress is also known as Dezh-e GonbadƒÅn (), literally \\"fortress of the domes\\"). The GonbadƒÅn-Dezh () mentioned in Shahnama, in which Isfandiyar was imprisoned, may be identified with Gerdkuh. Description Gerdkuh is located around west of Damghan off the main Semnan road. It is best approached via the nearby village Hajjiabad-e Razveh. The rock of Gerdkuh has a distinct conical shape which rises above the surrounding scree slopes. Apart from the east, the slopes are almost impossible to scale and no defensive works were necessary. The height of the plain surrounding the rock is , and the height of the top of Gerdkuh's fort is . The steepness of the rock and its height has been noted in the work History of Yuan, which claims no arrows or mangonel stones could reach it. The main perimeter defense consisted of rings of 35 forts with a total circumference of . The forts are more concentrated on the eastern side, which feature three rings of them‚Äîone away from the castle, another away, and the third one right at the foot of the castle. Their purpose may include the protection of the cultivated fertile ground on the castle's foot, and tax- collecting bases for passing caravans, as well as a more conventional and accessible place of storage relative to the buildings at the hilltop. A rectangular outer gatehouse on the southern side apparently served as a reception post. The proper entrance is, however, via the main gatehouse on the eastern side. The main gatehouse was wide and high. It featured two round turrets on each side made of smooth dressed stones. The outer ramp leading to this gate was probably built by the besieging Mongols. There is a spring just above this gatehouse. Via a line of defenses it leads to an inner gatehouse which defends the only possible ascent to the main castle. The mountain fortifications are defended with double walls built between towers. Natural perpendicular drops increased their effectiveness. Ruins of the late mudbrick wall on the hiltop The mountain top has its own fortifications. There is a citadel in length and in width. Its base is built with dressed blocks of stone and features a well in the middle. The main inhabited area, which is visible from the plain, was a complex of two rows of buildings on the south-eastern slope, all of them at least two or three stories high. On the north-east, there is a late mud wall with little remnants of buildings. On the south-west there is a cistern and remains of a defensive tower. The main water catchment area is, however, the three cisterns on the southern side of the hilltop where the ground drops steeply about . They feature an outer wall of in thickness made of stone and mud-brick covered by plaster, with vaulted roofs and turrets. There are more cisterns and wells elsewhere within the fortifications. History The fortress probably dates back to the pre- Islamic period. Gerdkuh was situated on the Khorasan Road and guarded the routes toward the Alborz mountain range. It was refortified and transferred into the Nizari Isma'ili possession in 1100 by Ra'is Mu'ayyad al-Din Muzaffar ibn Ahmad Mustawfi (), a secret Isma'ili convert and lieutenant of the Seljuq emir Amirdad Habashi (), who in turn had acquired Gedrkuh in 1096 from Sultan Barkiyaruq. Now under Hassan-i Sabbah, Muzaffar continued as the commandant of the stronghold until being succeeded by his son Sharaf al-Din Muhammad. Muzaffar reportedly dug an extremely deep well in the fort but did not reach the water. Years later, water gushed out after an earthquake. The Mongol siege In March 1253, H√ºleg√º's commander Kitbuqa, who was commanding the advance guard, crossed Oxus (Amu Darya) with 12,000 men (one t√ºmen plus two mingghans under K√∂ke Ilgei). In April 1253, he captured several Nizari fortresses in Quhistan and killed their inhabitants, and in May he attacked Qumis and laid siege to Gerdkuh with 5,000 men and build walls and siege works around it. Kitbuqa left an army under amir B√ºri to besiege Gerdkuh. In December 1253, Girdkuh's garrison sallied at night and killed 100 (or several hundred) Mongols, including B√ºri. In the summer of 1254, an outbreak of cholera in Gerdkuh weakened the garrison's resistance. However, unlike Lambsar, Gerdkuh survived the epidemic and was saved by the arrival of reinforcements from Ala al-Din Muhammad in Alamut. As H√ºleg√º's main army was advancing in Iran, Khurshah ordered Gerdkuh and fortresses of Quhistan to surrender. The Nizari chief in Gerdkuh, Qadi Tajuddin Mardanshah, surrendered, but the garrison continued to resist. In 1256, Maymun-Diz and Alamut surrendered and were destroyed by the Mongols, resulting in the official disestablishment of the Nizari Ismaili state. Khurshah was in the custody of the Mongols. As his position became intolerable, he asked H√ºleg√º to be allowed to go meet M√∂ngke in Mongolia to persuade the remaining Ismaili fortresses to surrender. M√∂ngke rebuked him due to his failure to hand over Lambsar and Gerdkuh, and ordered a general massacre of all Nizari Ismailis, including Khurshah. The Mongols had built permanent buildings, houses, and defensive walls near Gerdkuh, the ruins of which still remain today in Hajjiabad-e Razveh and other nearby villages. Two types of stones used for Nizari and Mongol mangonels were visible on the northeastern slope as of 1985. There are also remains of the Mongol siege works in the plain between Hajjiabad-e Razveh and Gerdkuh. On 15 December 1270, during the reign of Abaqa, the garrison of Gerdkuh surrendered from want of clothing. It was thirteen years after the fall of Alamut, and seventeen years after its first siege by Kitbuqa. The Mongols killed the surviving garrison but did not destroy the fortress. After the Mongol takeover Gerdkuh reappears only once in historical records in 1384, when it was briefly captured by the rebellious governor Amir Vali of Astarabad. It was probably completely abandoned in the early Safavid period. Modern studies The Qajar king Naser al-Din Shah (1848‚Äì1896) encouraged Shaykh Mohammad Mehdi Abdol-Rabb-Abadi to investigate the site, whose brief report contains accurate measurements. The site was visited multiple times by Peter Wiley, who left a detailed description in his book Eagle's Nest. In 1967 the site was reported to be covered with shards and artifacts; few of them were remaining in the following year. No archeological survey of the ruins has been made as of 2012. Among major Nizari castles, Gerdkuh is the least studied one.

Prenatal nutrition addresses nutrient recommendations before and during pregnancy. Nutrition and weight management before and during pregnancy has a profound effect on the development of infants. This is a rather critical time for healthy development since infants rely heavily on maternal stores and nutrient for optimal growth and health outcome later in life. Prenatal nutrition has a strong influence on birth weight and further development of the infant. There was a study at the National Institution of Health which found that babies born from an obese mother have a higher probability to fail tests of fine motor skills which is the movement of small muscles such as the hands and fingers. A common saying that a woman \\"is eating for two\\" while pregnant implies that a mother should consume twice as much during pregnancy, but is misleading. Although maternal consumption will directly affect both herself and the growing fetus, overeating excessively will compromise the baby's health as the infant will have to work extra hard to become healthy in the future. Compared with the infant, the mother possesses the least biological risk. Therefore, excessive calories, rather than going to the infant, often get stored as fat in the mother. On the other hand, insufficient consumption will result in lower birth weight. Maintaining a healthy weight during gestation lowers adverse risks on infants such as birth defects, as well as chronic conditions in adulthood such as obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Ideally, the rate of weight gain should be monitored during pregnancy to support the most ideal infant development. Background=Barker's hypothesis ‚Äì influences of birth weight on health in later life The \\"Barker Hypothesis\\", or Thrifty phenotype, states that conditions during pregnancy will have long-term effects on adult health. Associated risk of lifelong diseases includes cardiovascular disease, type-2 diabetes, obesity, and hypertension. Babies born lighter in weight appear to have an increased rate of mortality than babies born at a heavier weight. This does not mean that heavy babies are less of a concern. Death rate would rise as birth weight increases beyond normal birth weight range. Therefore, it is important to maintain a healthy gestational weight gain throughout pregnancy for achieving the optimal infant birth weight. When this theory was first proposed, it was not well accepted and was met with much skepticism. The main criticism was that confounding variables such as environmental factors could attribute to many of the chronic diseases such that low birth weight alone should not be dictated as an independent risk factor. Subsequent research studies supporting the theory attempted to adjust these environmental factors and in turn, provided more convincing results with minimal confounding variables. \\"Barker's Hypothesis\\" is also known as \\"Fetal Programming Hypothesis\\". The word \\"programming\\" illustrates the idea that during critical periods in early fetal development, there are persisting changes in the body structure and function that are caused by environmental stimuli. This relates to the concept of developmental plasticity where our genes can express different ranges of physiological or morphological states responding to the environmental conditions during fetal development. If the mother has an inadequate diet then it signals the baby that the living condition in the long term will be impoverished. Consequently, the baby adapts by changing its body size and metabolism to prepare for harsh conditions of food shortages after birth. Physiological and metabolic processes in the body undergo long-term changes as a result of restricted growth. When the living environment switches from the condition of malnutrition to a society of abundant supply of nutrients, this exposes the baby to a bountiful environment that goes against what its body is designed for and this places the baby at a higher risk of adult diseases later in adulthood. By the same token, if the fetus growing in the womb of a healthy mother is exposed to prolonged famine after birth, the infant would be less adaptive to the harsh environment than low-birth-weight babies. Pedersen's hypothesis ‚Äì influences of maternal glucose concentration on fetal growth In 1952, the Danish physician J√∏rgen Pedersen of the University of Copenhagen, formulated the hypothesis that maternal hyperglycemia during pregnancy might cause fetal hyperglycemia, thus exposing the fetus to elevated insulin levels. This would result in an increased risk of fetal macrosomia and neonatal hypoglycemia.Erh√∂hte Blutzuckerwerte bei Schwangeren gef√§hrden das Kind The blood glucose concentration in humans is mainly dependent on diet, especially energy-ingestion and the percentage of carbohydrates in the diet. High glucose concentrations in the blood of pregnant women cause an intensified transfer of nutrient to the fetus, increasing fetal growth.The influence of maternal glucose metabolism on fetal growth, development and morbidity in 917 singleton pregnancies in nondiabetic women Studies could link higher maternal glucose to an increase in infant birth weight as well as different extents of morbidity, among other things the incidence of congenital malformations, supporting the Hypothesis, that even moderately increased blood glucose in the absence of diabetes positively influences growth in the fetus.Maternal Glucose Concentration Influences Fetal Growth, Gestation, and Pregnancy Complications Subsequently, alterations of Pedersen's Hypothesis took place: Nutrients other than sugar and their linkage to fetal overgrowth in diabetic pregnancy were taken into account, too, but the crucial role of the fetal hyperinsulinism and monitoring of motherly glucose was nevertheless stressed. Recent studies pointed out that diabetes in the mother could foster even more lasting effects on the child's health than previously thought, even raising the risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes.Maternal Glycemia and Neonatal Adiposity: New Insights from the Hyperglycemia and Adverse Pregnancy Outcomes (HAPO) Study Historical cases Various nutritional conditions, both times of scarcity and of abundance occurred time and again in different societies at different times, and thus in some cases epidemiological studies have exposed a correlation between the nutritional status of pregnant women and the health of their children or even grandchildren. A tile tribute to the Dutch Famine The Dutch famine Since small birth weight is associated with an increased risk of chronic diseases in later life, and poor maternal nutrition during gestation contributes to restricted fetal development, maternal malnutrition may be a cause of increased disease susceptibility in adulthood. The Dutch famine of 1944 or the \\"Hunger Winter\\" during World War II serves as an epidemiological study that is used to examine the effects of maternal under-nutrition during different gestational stages. The famine was a period (roughly five to six months) of extreme food shortage in the west of the Netherlands. The famine was imposed on a previously well-nourished population and the official daily ration for the general adult population gradually decreased from 1800 calories in December 1943 to 1400 calories in October 1944 to below 1000 calories in the late November 1944. December 1944 to April 1945 was the peak of the famine where the official daily ration fell abruptly to about 400~800 calories. Even though pregnant and lactating women had extra food during the famine, these extra supplies could no longer be provided peaking the famine. In the early May 1945, the liberation of the Netherlands restored the food supply. The daily ration had increased to more than 2000 calories in June 1945. What is unique about Dutch Famine as an experimental study on the effects of maternal malnutrition is that the population was strictly circumscribed in time and place and the sudden onset and relief of the famine was imposed on a previously well-nourished population. The Dutch Famine during World War II had a profound effect on the health condition of the general public, especially women who conceived during the period of time. The period of maternal starvation is shown to have limited intrauterine growth and has been identified as one of the most important contributors to coronary heart disease as well as other chronic diseases later in life. These findings agree well with Barker's hypothesis; it supports the theory that maternal under-nutrition leads to a lower birth weight due to restricted intrauterine development and ultimately leads to higher risks of chronic conditions in adult life. The French paradox The French paradox regards the seemingly paradoxical fact that people living in France since many generations suffer from a relatively little incidence of heart disease, although the traditional French cuisine is high in saturated fatty acids. One explanation suggested for the paradox is the potential impact of nutritional enhancements during pregnancy and the first months and years of life that would positively influence the health of following generations: After the defeat in the Franco-German War, a nutrition program for pregnant women and small children with the aim of strengthening future generations of soldiers was introduced by the French Government. This might be one explanation for positive health-outcomes in following generations.BBC News: Health French health mystery Size Matters: How Height Affects the Health, Happiness, and Success of Boys Recommendations for pregnant women=Gestation stages Gestation is the period of embryo development from conception to birth. Gestation is about 40 weeks in humans and is divided into three trimesters, each spanning 3 months. Gestational stages, on the other hand, are based on physiological fetal development, which include the germinal stage, embryonic stage and fetal stage. Germinal stage is the stage from fertilization to about 2 weeks. The fertilized egg or the zygote becomes a blastocyst where the outer layer and the inner cell mass differentiate to form placenta and the fetus respectively. Implantation occurs at this stage where the blastocyst becomes buried in the endometrium. Embryonic stage is approximately from 2 weeks to 8 weeks. It is also in this stage where the blastocyst develops into an embryo, where all major features of humans are present and operational by the end of this stage. Fetal stage is from 9 weeks to term. During this period of time, the embryo develops rapidly and becomes a fetus. Pregnancy becomes visible at this stage.

A rotatable 3D version of this photo is available here , and a sketch is available here . Pre-pregnancy weight and gestational weight gain BMI chart. The pattern and amount of weight gain is closely associated with gestational stages. Additional energy is required during pregnancy due to the expansion of maternal tissues and stored to support fetal development. In the first trimester (blastogenesis and early embryonic stages), the mother experiences a minimal weight gain (approximately 0.5-2 kilograms), while the embryo weighs only 6 grams. In the second trimester and third trimester (late embryonic and fetal stages), the fetus undergoes rapid weight growth and the weight increases to about 3000~4000 grams. It is also in this period that the mother experiences the bulk of her gestational weight gain but the amount of weight gain varies greatly. The amount of weight gain depends strongly on their pre-pregnant weight. Generally, a normal weight is strongly recommended for mothers when entering gestation, as it promotes overall health of infants. Maternal body weight is determined by the Body Mass Index (BMI) which is defined as the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters. While pregnant, body weight should be managed within the recommended gestational weight gain range as it is shown to have a positive effect on pregnancy outcomes. Gestational weight gain should also be progressive and the recommended weight depends on pre-pregnant body weight. Since the total weight gain depends on pre-pregnant body weight, it is recommended that underweight women should undergo a larger weight gain for healthy pregnancy outcomes, and overweight or obese women should undergo a smaller weight gain. =Normal weight women= Health choices such as low- fat milk and alternatives, fruits, and vegetables should be emphasized for pregnant women. Women having a BMI of 18.5~24.9 are classified as having a normal or healthy body weight. This group has the lowest risk of adverse birth outcomes. Their babies are least likely to either be low-birth weight or high- birth weight. It is advised that women with a normal weight before pregnancy should gain a total of 11.5 kilograms to 16.0 kilograms throughout gestation, which is approximately 0.4 kilogram per week in the second and third trimesters. In order to maintain a steady weight gain, the mother should engage in mild physical activities. Participating in aerobic activities such as walking and swimming 3 to 4 times a week is usually adequate. Vigorous physical activity is not recommended since an excessive loss of calories is induced which is not sufficient to support fetal development. A proper diet is also essential to healthy weight gain. The common saying \\"a woman is eating for two\\" often leads to mothers thinking that they should eat twice as much. In reality, only a small increase in caloric intake is needed to provide for the fetus; approximately 350 calories more in the second trimester and 450 calories more in the third trimester. Also, healthy choices should be emphasized for these extra calories such as whole grain products, fruits and vegetables as well as low-fat dairy alternatives. =Underweight women= Women are classified as underweight if they have a pre-pregnant BMI of 18.5 or below. Low pre-pregnancy BMI increases the risk of low birth weight infants, but the risk can be balanced by an appropriate gestational weight gain from 12.5 to 18.0 kilograms in total, or about 0.5 kilogram each week in the second and third trimesters. Underweight women usually have inadequate nutrient stores that are not enough to provide for both herself and the fetus. While exercise and a proper diet are both needed to maintain the recommended weight gain, a balance between the two is very important. As such, underweight mothers should seek individualized advice tailored especially for themselves. =Overweight and obese women= Women with a high pre-pregnancy weight are classified as overweight or obese, defined as having a BMI of 25 or above. Women with BMI between 25 and 29.9 are in the overweight category and should gain between 7.0 and 11.5 kilograms in total, corresponding to approximately 0.28 kilogram each week during the second and third trimesters. Whereas women with BMI of 30 or above are in the obese category and should gain only between 5.0 and 9.0 kilograms overall, which equates to roughly 0.2 kilogram per week in the second and third trimesters. Diet, exercise or a combination of both has been seen to reduce weight gain in pregnancy by 20% and reduce high blood pressure. Diet with exercise may reduce the risk of caesarean section, having a large baby and having a baby with serious breathing problems. Diet and exercise help pregnant women not gain too much weight during pregnancy when compared with giving the women no help to control weight gain or routine care (usually one session in the pregnancy). In general, walking is encouraged for mothers classified in this category. Unfortunately, estimated energy requirements for them are not available. As such, they are encouraged to record activity and intake level. This can be done with the help of tools such as My Food Guide Servings Tracker from Health Canada and EATracker that are available online. In extreme cases where the BMI exceeds 35, help from a registered dietitian is recommended. =Summary table= The following table summarizes the recommended rate of weight gain and total weight gain according to pre-pregnancy BMI for singleton pregnancies. The first column categorizes the type of body weight based on the Body Mass Index. The second column summarizes the total recommended weight gain for each type of body weight, and the third column presents the corresponding weekly weight gain during the period when the fetus undergoes rapid growth (during second and third trimesters). In extreme cases, the amount of total and weekly weight gain can vary by a factor of two depending on a woman's pre-pregnant weight. For example, a woman in the obese category is recommended to gain a total of 5~9 kilograms, whereas an underweight woman needs to gain up to 18 kilograms in weight. { align=center border=1  Pre-pregnancy BMI Category  Recommendated Total Weight Gain  Weekly Weight Gain (after 12 weeks) ----  Underweight BMI <18.5  12.5~18 kg (28~40 lb)  0.5 kg (1.0 lb) ----  Healthy weight BMI 18.5~ 24.9  11.5~16 kg (25~35 lb)  0.4 kg (1.0 lb) ----  Overweight BMI 25.0~ 29.9  7.0~ 11.5 kg (15~25 lb)  0.3 kg (0.6 lb) ----  Obese BMI > 30  5.0~9.0 kg (11~20 lb)  0.2 kg (0.5 lb) }. Recommendations for low and high birth weight=Diagnosis Ultrasound of fetus (~3 inches in length). To have a good estimate of birth weight, ultrasonography or ultrasound during pregnancy and the date of last menstrual period are needed. Measured values from ultrasonography are compared with the growth chart to estimate fetal weight. Crown-rump length can be used as the best ultrasonographic measurement for correct diagnosis of gestational age during the first trimester. This correlation between crown-rump length and gestational age would be most effectively shown when no growth defects are observed in the first trimester. If growth defects were observed in the first trimester, then the measurement of the date of last menstrual period becomes quite important since the crown- heel length has become less of a reliable indicator of gestational age. After the 20th week of pregnancy, the mother would need to visit the doctor for the measurement of fundal height, which is the length from the top portion of the uterus to the pubic bone.\\"Small for Gestational Age\\", Lucile Packard Children's Hospital, 2010. Retrieved 9 November 2010. The length measured in centimeters should correspond to the number of weeks that the mother has been pregnant. If the measured number is higher or lower than 2 centimeters, further tests using ultrasound would be needed to check the results. Another way to estimate fetal size is to look at the mother's weight gain. How much weight the mother gains can be used to indicate fetal size. Low birth weight Birth weight chart. There are two ways to determine small for gestational age (SGA) infants. Many research studies agree that SGA babies are those with birth weight or crown-heel length measured at two standard deviations or more below the mean of the infant's gestational age, based on data consisting of a reference population. Other studies classify SGA babies as those with birth weight values below the 10th percentile of the growth chart for babies of the same gestational age. This indicates that these babies are weighing less than 90% of babies of the same gestational age. Many factors, including maternal, placental, and fetal factors, contribute to the cause of impaired fetal growth. There are a number of maternal factors, which include age, nutritional status, alcohol abuse, smoking, and medical conditions. Insufficient uteroplacental perfusion is an example of a placental factor. Chromosomal abnormalities and genetic diseases are examples of fetal factors. Identification of the causes of SGA for individual cases aids health professionals in finding ways to handle each unique case.Lisa Gourley, \\"Prenatal Nutrition\\", Healthline Networks, Inc., 2002. Retrieved 5 November 2010. Nutritional counseling, education, and consistent monitoring can be helpful to assist women bearing SGA infants. Complications for the infant include limitations in body growth since the number and size of cells in tissues is smaller. The infant likely did not receive enough oxygen during pregnancy so the oxygen level is low. It is also more difficult to maintain body temperature since there is less blood flow within the small body. As such, it is necessary to monitor oxygen level to make sure that it doesn't go too low. If the baby can't suck well, then it may be necessary for tube-feed. Since the baby cannot maintain body temperature sufficiently, a temperature- controlled bed would help to keep their bodies from losing heat. There are ways to help prevent SGA babies. Monitoring fetal growth can help identify the problem during pregnancy well before birth. It would be beneficial to seek professional help and counseling. High birth weight Ultrasound examination. Research shows that when birth weights of infants are greater than the 90th percentile of the growth chart for babies of the same gestational age, they are considered large for gestational age or LGA.Children's Hospital of Wisconsin, \\"Large for Gestational Age\\", Children's Hospital and Health System, 2010. Retrieved 9 November 2010. This indicates that these babies are weighing more than 90% of babies of the same gestational age. Many factors account for LGA babies, including genetics and excessive nutrient supply. It seems that a common factor for LGA babies is whether or not the mother has diabetes when she is pregnant. An indicator for excessive growth, regardless of gestational age, is the appearance of macrosomia.BabyCenter Medical Advisory Board, \\"Labor complication: Big baby (macrosomia)\\", BabyCenter, L.L.C., 2006. Retrieved 5 November 2010. Many complications are observed for LGA babies and their mothers. A longer delivery time may be expected since it is a difficult birth. The infant would likely suffer hypoglycemia (low glucose level in the blood) after birth. The infant would also have difficulty breathing. There might be a need for early delivery if the baby gets too big and perhaps Caesarean section would be needed. Since the baby is bigger, there's a higher chance of injury when coming out of the mother's body. To increase the blood glucose level in blood, a glucose/water solution can be offered to the infant. There are ways to help prevent LGA babies. It is necessary to monitor fetal growth and perform pregnancy examinations to determine health status and detect any possibility of unrecognized diabetes. For diabetic mothers, careful management of diabetes during pregnancy period would be helpful in terms of lowering some of the risks of LGA. Points to consider The goal of pregnancy is to have a healthy baby. Maintaining healthy and steady weight gain during pregnancy promotes overall health and reduces the incidence of prenatal morbidity and mortality. This, in turn, has a positive effect on the baby's health. Since conditions during pregnancy will have long-term effects on adult health, \\"moderation\\" should be considered for both dietary and physical activity recommendations. Most importantly, the total recommended pregnancy weight gain depends on pre-pregnant body weight, and weight issues should be addressed before pregnancy. Future direction for research It is reasonable to expect higher weight gain for multiple gestations. Recommendations for women carrying twins are given but more research should be done to precisely determine the total weight gain, as these ranges are wide. Also, the ranges for underweight women carrying twins is unknown. There was not enough information to recommend weight gain cutoffs and guidelines for women carrying three or more babies, women of short stature (<157 centimetres), and pregnant teens. Estimated energy requirements (EER) for overweight/obese women are unavailable so more research is needed to evaluate on that. There are also important links between nutrition and mental health across pregnancy. For example, a woman experiencing low mood may be more likely to smoke, use alcohol or neglect her diet Practical advice for mothers The following general tips can be helpful to pregnant women. It would be beneficial to maintain adequate physical activity to meet energy needs from the food consumed. Eating a balanced diet would be optimal for healthy pregnancy results.Larissa Hirsch, \\"Staying Healthy During Pregnancy\\", The Nemours Foundation, 2008. Retrieved 17 November 2010. To prevent problems like dehydration and constipation, it is important to drink enough fluids, especially water, to support blood volume increases during pregnancy.Ministry of Health Promotion, \\"The Juicy Story on Drinks\\", Queen's Printer for Ontario, 2010. Retrieved 18 November 2010. It is recommended to accompany regular meals with a daily prenatal vitamin supplement that has sufficient folic acid and iron content. If the fetus is predicted to have low birth weight, in addition to the general recommendations, it would be ideal to increase caloric intake, which can be done by having extra Food Guide Servings daily. If the fetus is predicted to have high birth weight, smaller and more frequent meals should be consumed to allow better weight management. Moderate sugar intake, such as fruit juices, is also suggested.Alberta clinical experts, \\"Prediabetes or Impaired Glucose Intolerance\\" , HealthLink Alberta, 2008. Retrieved 21 November 2010.

He was placed under the tuition of an obscure painter called Gaspar Meyer. When he was seventeen he was sent to Paris, where he of studied under Charles Le Brun, who thought highly enough of his abilities to employ him to paint from his designs, in the works he was then engaged in at Versailles. On his return to Switzerland he was invited to the Court of W√ºrtemberg, where he met with great encouragement. He was equal to the composition of grand historical subjects, which he treated with nobleness, and painted with great spirit and fire.

In June 2014, Hardaker received a five-match ban and a ¬£300 fine for making homophobic comments which appeared to be directed towards referee James Child. Hardaker issued a public apology for the incident, claiming the insult had been directed towards Warrington Wolves player Michael Monaghan rather than the referee. In March 2015, Hardaker and Leeds teammate Elliot Minchella were detained and questioned by police over the alleged assault of a 22-year-old student, causing Hardaker to miss his side's 18‚Äì6 defeat by Warrington Wolves. Hardaker did not face criminal charges, but admitted to the assault and agreed to pay ¬£200 compensation and write a letter of apology to the victim. He was also once again subject to internal disciplinary action by his club. In October 2017, Hardaker was omitted from Castleford Tigers squad for the 2017 Super League Grand Final against former club Leeds. Castleford issued a statement saying that Hardaker had been left out for an unspecified \\"breach of club rules\\". On 9 October 2017, Castleford released a statement confirming Hardaker had received a suspension after testing positive for a banned substance. It was also announced that Hardaker would not be selected for the England squad for the 2017 Rugby League World Cup after testing positive for cocaine. In September 2018, Hardaker was arrested for allegedly drink driving, driving without insurance, and driving without a valid MOT. He was banned from driving in October 2018, having been found to be over double the legal limit.

Israel Defense Forces. Eiland is a former head of the Israeli National Security Council. After his retirement from the public sector, he was a senior research associate at the Institute for National Security Studies (INSS). Eiland is a frequent commentator and contributor on international security matters on local and foreign media. In 2007 he founded a consulting company of national security and strategic services for governments and multinational organizations. He holds an M.B.A. and B.A. in economics from Bar Ilan University. Biography=Military service Eiland joined the army in 1970, and served in the Paratroopers Brigade Battalion 890.Gal Perl Finkel, IDF Strategy 2.0, The Jerusalem Post, May 22, 2018. He served in a variety of roles within the brigade: as platoon leader (1973 Battle of the Chinese Farm in the Yom Kippur War),Major General Giora Eiland, IISS, 25 February 2005 an operations officer, company commander (1976 Operation Entebbe), vice-commander of a battalion (1978 Operation Litani), commander of 50 \\"Baselet\\" Airborne Battalion (1982 First Lebanon War) and reserve commander of the Paratroopers Brigade. Following First Lebanon War Eiland served as commander of Infantry Officers School of the Chief Officer of Infantry Corps (Israel). In 1984 Eiland completed the Advanced Infantry Course at Fort Benning, Georgia, United States. After his return to Israel he was appointed as Operations Directorate officer in the Infantry Corps (Israel). In the years 1990‚Äì1992 he commanded the IDF Officers School (Training Base 1), and in the years 1992‚Äì1993 was the commander of the Givati Brigade. At 1993 Eiland was appointed as the head of the Paratroopers and Infantry Corps in the rank of Brigadier General. In 1996 Eiland was appointed Head of Operations Division in Operations Directorate, and in 1999 he was appointed Head of Operations Directorate in rank of Major General.Gal Perl Finkel, It‚Äôs the man (or woman) who makes the job, The Jerusalem Post, November 19, 2018. In this role he was involved in preparations for the IDF withdrawal from Lebanon and also in conflict with the Palestinians ( Second Intifada ).Fields Of Fire, by Matt Rees, Time, December 10, 2000 In 2001 he was appointed head of the Planning Directorate. Still an army officer, Eiland took part in the political process, during the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian peace process and was appointed to accompany the Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, in his talks with Yasser Arafat. Eiland also represented the Israeli security forces in talks with U.S., Palestinian and other officials. In 2003, with the end of his term in the Planning Directorate, Eiland rejected an offer to become IDF attache in Washington, and retired from the army after 33 years of service. National Security Council Eiland left the Planning Directorate and the IDF to accept, in January 2004, Sharon's offer that he head the National Security Council (NSC).Inside Track / Ready for the next Entebbe? Haaretz October 19, 2010 Eiland was the fourth NSC head in the six years of the Council's existence, the others being David Ivri, Uzi Dayan, and Ephraim Halevy, and could not penetrate the walls around the Prime Minister's office. However, unlike Dayan and Levy, whose terms were marked by worsening relations with Prime Minister Sharon, Eiland had a constructive working relationship with the Prime Minister, despite their practical disagreements. In early 2003, a few weeks after his retirement from the army and arrival to the NSC, Eiland became aware of Sharon's disengagement initiative ‚Äì at that stage the initiative had more limited objectives in the Gaza Strip and broader in the West Bank. Eiland agreed that a political initiative was needed, but objected to both the content of Sharon's proposal and the procedure for preparing and presenting it. In 2004 Eiland took part in drawing up the disengagement plan in close consultations with US Advisors among them National Security Council Middle East Advisor Elliott Abrams. Eiland shuttled with Ariel Sharon's Chief of Staff, between Washington and Jerusalem to hammer up successive drafts.The Sharon Unilateral Disengagement Plan Journal of Palestine Studies Vol. 33, No. 4 (Summer, 2004), pp. 85‚Äì107 It was Eiland's initiative to establish a Disengagement Authority and to set a realistic schedule program. The plan, as adopted by the Israeli Government and the Knesset, is largely a result of Eiland's formulation. During the year 2005 there were reports in the media about Eiland's criticism of the policy and the national security decision- making process. After the implementation of the disengagement plan had been concluded, Eiland informed the Prime Minister that he had exhausted his ability to influence the process and he decided to resign from the NSC. Among other tasks during his tenure, Eiland was appointed as the head of the first governmental steering committee on cyber. On June 1, 2006 he was replaced as head of NSC by former deputy head of the Mossad, Ilan Mizrahi. After retiring from the Council In 2006 Eiland was appointed by the Chief of Staff, Dan Halutz, as the head of the examination committee of experts, to investigate the capture of the Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit by the Hamas to Gaza Strip. In 2010 Eiland headed a team of experts examining the preparations and in the actual boarding of the Gaza flotilla raid. Eiland presented the report to the chief of staff, Gabi Ashkenazi on July 12, 2010.Maj-Gen (res.) Eiland presents conclusions of examination teamGiora Eiland On May 29, 2011, Eiland said on Kol Yisrael Radio that in his view it would be better for Israel to let the next flotilla ‚Äì expected to set out in late June 2011 ‚Äì get through to Gaza, provided that the Government of Turkey would be willing to take responsibility for the flotilla, inspect all ships and make sure they were not carrying arms. In 2007, he founded a private consulting company, giving advice to several companies in the defense industry of Israel, as well as to Israel Military Industries. The company also provides services in various settings to foreign governments, multinational corporations, and organizations. Among other projects, Eiland gave an expert's witness and submitted an expert's opinion on security aspects, in the international arbitration in the case of the Egyptian pipeline explosion which halted the flow of gas to Israel due to a series of terrorist explosions in 2011. In 2015 the arbitration ruled in favor of the Israeli prosecutor, telling the Egyptian gas companies to pay a compensation of $1.8 billion. Eiland regularly writes op-ed articles in Yediot Aharonot. In these he reiterates two specific interlinked ideas. Eiland calls for Israel to recognise Hamas as the effective government of the Gaza Strip and cease any attempt to topple Hamas or facilitate restoration of Palestinian Authority rule in Gaza. And Eiland promotes the idea of \\"A Regional Solution\\" for the Palestinian problem, whereby Israel would annex a large part of the West Bank, and Egypt would compensate the Palestinians by ceding to them part of the Sinai Peninsula. As of March 2019, Eiland's ideas were not adopted by Israeli, Palestinian or Egyptian decision-makers; indeed, Palestinians and Egyptians on several occasions vehemently denounced them.

It is a mixture of various culinary traditions, including Bantu, Arab, Portuguese, Indian, British and even Chinese cuisine. Early history Vegetables and food market, Stone Town The first inhabitants of Zanzibar were Bantus coming from mainland Tanganyika. They consisted of mostly fishers and their diet thus consisted of primarily seafood, such as tuna, mackerel, lobster, squid, octopus and oysters. Other ingredients and recipes brought by Bantus that are found in today's Zanzibari cuisine (some of which became widespread during European colonialism) are common beans, sweet potatoes, manioc chips, yam and plaintain. In the 9th century, Omanis, Yemenis and Persians began colonizing the Swahili Coast, including the Zanzibar Archipelago. They brought new dishes and ingredients, most notably spices, coconut, mango, citrus and rice. One of the most common Zanzibar recipes, the pilau (pilaf) rice (i.e., rice, coconuts, nuts and spices), clearly reflects its Arab origin. Between the 15th century and the 16th century, the Portuguese quickly conquered most of the coast, including Zanzibar. The main Portuguese influences on Zanzibari cuisine was the introduction of those that would become major types of staple food in Zanzibar, namely manioc, maize and pineapple. In 1651, the Portuguese lost control of Zanzibar to the Omani sultanate. The Omanis brought new spices and intensified the commercial relationships between Zanzibar and India; as a consequence, Indian recipes such as chutney, masala, biryani, curry, fish cakes and samoosa (samosa) made it to Zanzibar. Most recipes of foreign origin were adapted to the ingredients that were available on the island, thus giving birth to a largely original \\"fusion\\" cuisine. Around the beginning of the 20th century, most of the African Great Lakes region was colonised by the Germans and the British. Those did not mix with the local population as much as the Arabs, Persians and Indians had done, and their influence on Zanzibari cuisine is less evident; yet, some very common Zanzibari recipes, such as pepper steak, can be generically defined as having a European origin. Post-independence After independence, Tanzania established a strong relationship with China; Chinese physicians, engineers, and military consultants came to Zanzibar. Although only a small fraction of today's Zanzibari population has Chinese origins, some recipes and ingredients, such as soy sauce, have become commonplace on the island. Examples A spice stall in the Stone Town market of Zanzibar. Below are seven examples of the fine Zanzibar dishes: 1.Sorpotel Sorpotel is a recipe of Portuguese-Indian (Goan) origin, consisting of a mixture of boiled meat; in Zanzibar, this includes tongue, heart and liver. It is cooked with masala (a mix of spices similar to curry), as well as tamarind and vinegar. 2.Spice cake The spice cake is the most typical dessert in Zanzibari cuisine. It is made of a pastry with a mix of cinnamon, clove, nutmeg and chocolate. 3.Boko-boko Boko-boko is a sort of stew of meat cooked in maize, ginger, cumin, chili, tomato and onion.Resta, Lizzie. \\"A Culture Seen Through Cuisine: Traditional Zanzibari Recipes.\\" (2008).

The great-granddaughter of Gruffydd ap Llywelyn, king of Wales, Sibyl was also connected to the nobility of England and Normandy. Sibyl inherited the titles and lands of her father, Bernard de Neufmarch√©, Lord of Brecon, after her mother, Nest ferch Osbern, had declared her brother Mahel to have been illegitimate. Most of these estates passed to Sibyl's husband, Miles de Gloucester, 1st Earl of Hereford, as her dowry. Their marriage had been arranged personally by King Henry I of England in the spring of 1121. Sibyl, with her extensive lands, was central to the King's plans of consolidating Anglo-Norman power in south-east Wales by the merging of her estates with those of Miles, his loyal subject on whom he relied to implement Crown policy. As an adult, Sibyl lived through King Stephen's turbulent reign, known to history as the Anarchy, in which her husband played a pivotal role. Following Miles' accidental death in 1143, Sibyl entered a religious life at Llanthony Secunda Priory, Gloucestershire, England, which she had endowed up to six years previously. Sibyl is buried at the priory, founded by Miles in 1136. Family=Ancestry Sibyl was born in about 1100 in Brecon Castle, Brecon, Wales, the only daughter of Marcher Lord Bernard de Neufmarch√©, Lord of Brecon, and Nest ferch Osbern. Nest was the daughter of Osbern FitzRichard and Nest ferch Gruffydd and granddaughter of Gruffydd ap Llywelyn, king of Wales, and Ealdgyth of Mercia.Davies, 1993, p. 100 Sibyl's father, Bernard, was born at the castle of Le Neuf-March√©-en- Lions, on the frontier between Normandy and Beauvais. Bernard was a knight who had fought under English kings William I, William Rufus and Henry I. According to historian Lynn H Nelson, Bernard de Neufmarch√© was \\"the first of the original conquerors of Wales\\". He led the Norman army at the Battle of Brecon in 1093, during which Rhys ap Tewdwr was killed.Davies, 1993, p. 103 Kingship in Wales ended with Rhys' death, and allowed Bernard to confirm his hold on Brycheiniog, becoming the first ruler of the Lordship of Brecknock. The title and lands would remain in his family's possession until 1521. The name Neufmarch√©, Novo Mercato in Latin, is anglicised into 'Newmarket' or 'Newmarch'. Inheritance Sibyl had two brothers, Philip, who most likely died young, and Mahel. Nest had Mahel disinherited by swearing to King Henry I of England that Mahel had been fathered by another man. According to Giraldus Cambrensis, this was done out of vengeance when Mahel had mutilated Nest's lover, a knight whose identity is not disclosed. In the 19th century, Bernard Bolingbroke Woodward proposed that, after Bernard's death, Nest \\"disgraced herself with an intrigue\\" with one of his soldiers. Mahel, who had by this time inherited Bernard's estates, disapproved of the liaison to such an extent that he killed Nest's lover. Nest's revenge was to have Mahel disinherited by claiming that Bernard was not Mahel's father. The maritagium (marriage charter) arranged by King Henry I in 1121 for the marriage between Sibyl and her future husband Miles, however, makes it clear that Bernard was still alive when it was written; showing Bernard Bolingbroke Woodward's version of the story to diverge from the known facts. quotes a translation from the Latin of the grant by Henry I which includes Sibyl's maritagium (Public Records Office, London, DL10/6). Author Jennifer C. Ward suggests that, although the marriage charter recorded that King Henry was acting at the request of Bernard, Nest, and the barons, it was probable he had put considerable pressure on the Neufmarch√©s to disinherit Mahel in favour of Sibyl and, thereby, Miles. Nevertheless, whatever the timing or reason, the outcome of Nest's declaration was that Sibyl (whom Nest acknowledged as Bernard's child) became the sole lawful heiress to the vast Lordship of Brecon, one of the most important and substantial fiefs in the Welsh Marches. Henry's maritagium referred specifically to Sibyl's parents' lands as \\"comprising Talgarth, the forest of Ystradwy, the castle of Hay, the whole land of Brecknock, up to the boundaries of the land of Richard Fitz Pons, namely up to Brecon and Much Cowarne, a vill in England\\"; the fees and services of several named individuals were also granted as part of the dowry. This made her suo jure Lady of Brecknock on her father's death, and one of the wealthiest heiresses in south Wales. .. Marriage Sometime in April or May 1121, Sibyl married Miles (or Milo) FitzWalter de Gloucester, who on his father's death in 1129, became sheriff of Gloucester,; \\"The power of these families ... was further increased ... in each case the custody of a castle was held together with the shrievalty\\" . and Constable of England.. The marriage was personally arranged by King Henry I, to whom Miles was a trusted royal official. A charter written in Latin (the maritagium), which dates to 10 April/29 May 1121, records the arrangements for the marriage of Sibyl and Miles.Note:The charter is located in the Public Record Office, London, DL10/6; in Latin Historian C. Warren Hollister found the charter's wording telling, noting that \\"the king gave the daughter as if he were making a grant of land\\": \\"Know that I [King Henry I] have given and firmly granted to Miles of Gloucester Sibyl, daughter of Bernard de Neufmarch√©, together with all the lands of Bernard her father and of her mother after their deaths ... \\". Her parents' lands would be conveyed to Miles after their deaths or earlier during \\"their life if they so wish\\". Henry also commanded that the fief's tenants were to pay Miles liege homage as their lord. By arranging a series of matrimonial alliances, similar to that between Sibyl and Miles, King Henry I of England transformed \\"the map of territorial power in south-east Wales\\". Such arrangements were mutually advantageous. Hollister describes Miles' marriage to Sibyl as having been a \\"crucial breakthrough in his career\\". The new lords, in similar positions to Miles, were the King's own loyal vassals, on whom he could rely to implement royal policy. Sibyl's father died sometime before 1128 (most probably in 1125), and Miles came into possession of her entire inheritance, which when merged with his own estates, formed one honour. Children Together Sibyl and Miles had eight children: * Margaret of Hereford (1122/1123- 6 April 1197), married Humphrey II de Bohun, by whom she had children. She received the office of constable of England and exercised lordship of Herefordshire as a widow until her death. * Roger Fitzmiles, 2nd Earl of Hereford (before 1125- 22 September 1155). Roger's marriage settlement with Cecily FitzJohn (her first marriage), daughter of Payn FitzJohn and Sibyl de Lacy, was ratified by King Stephen in 1137. The marriage was childless as were Cecily's subsequent marriages. * Walter de Hereford (died 1159/60), whether he married is unknown; however, Walter departed for Palestine on Michaelmas 1159, and died shortly afterwards without leaving legitimate issue * Henry Fitzmiles (died c.1162), married a woman named Isabella, surname unknown; Henry died without legitimate issue. * Mahel de Hereford (died 1164), no record of marriage; died without legitimate issue. * William de Hereford (died 1166), no record of marriage; died without legitimate issue. * Bertha of Hereford (c.1130-), married William de Braose, 3rd Lord of Bramber, by whom she had issue. * Lucy of Hereford, Lady of Blaen Llyfni and Bwlch y Dinas (died 1219/20), married Herbert FitzHerbert of Winchester, by whom she had issue. The Anarchy After Henry I's death in 1135, the throne of England was seized by Stephen of Blois, a grandson of William I of England. Henry's daughter, Empress Matilda (Maud), also claimed the throne, and had the support of the Marcher Lords. On the death of her husband, the Holy Roman Emperor, Henry V, in 1125, Matilda had returned to England for the first time in 16 years. At the insistence of her father, the barons (including Stephen) swore to uphold Matilda's rights as his heir. Matilda married Geoffrey of Anjou in 1128. They lived together in France, having three sons; the eldest of whom was to become King Henry II of England.. Initially, Miles supported Stephen.. In about 1136, Stephen granted Sibyl's husband the entire honour of Gloucester and Brecknock, and appointed him Constable of Gloucester Castle, whereby Miles became known as one of Stephen's \\"henchmen\\". Llanthony Priory had been established near Crucorney, in the Vale of Ewyas, in 1118; Wales' earliest Augustine monastery. Miles' father, Walter de Gloucester, had retired there by 1126. The unrest that had been simmering in Wales during the last years of Henry's reign, boiled over in 1135 on his death. The area around the priory returned to Welsh rule, coming under such ‚Äúhostile molestation‚Äù from the Welsh that the non-Welsh canons decided to leave. Miles established a new Priory for them in Gloucester, England, which they called Llanthony Secunda, in 1136. Sometime after 1137, Sibyl, together with her husband, made a further endowment to Llanthony Secunda. Miles transferred his allegiance to Empress Matilda, on her return to England in 1139. According to Professor Edmund King, Miles' decision to support Matilda was guided by expediancy rather than principle, and the necessity of joining forces with Matilda's illegitimate half-brother, the powerful Robert, Earl of Gloucester, who was the overlord of some of Miles' fiefs. Stephen stripped Miles of the title 'Constable of England' in punishment for having deserted him. On 25 July 1141, in gratitude for his support and military assistance and, according to historian R.H.C. Davis, possibly to compensate Miles for having appeared to have lost the constableship, Matilda invested him as 1st Earl of Hereford. He also received St. Briavels Castle and the Forest of Dean. At the time Matilda was the de facto ruler of England, Stephen having been imprisoned at Bristol following his capture the previous February after the Battle of Lincoln. Sibyl was styled Countess of Hereford, until Miles' unexpected death over two years later. In 1141, Miles received the honour of Abergavenny from Brien FitzCount, the (likely illegitimate) son of Duke Alan IV of Brittany. This was in appreciation of the skilled military tactics Miles had deployed which had spared Brien's castle of Wallingford during King Stephen's besiegement in 1139/1140. Matilda gave her permission for the transfer. During the Anarchy, which the period of Stephen's reign as King of England was to become known, life was greatly disrupted in her husband's lands. Sibyl would have doubtless suffered as a result, especially after Miles' decision to support Matilda's claim to the throne and to oppose Stephen.. When Matilda was defeated at Winchester in late 1141, Miles was compelled to return to Gloucester in disgrace: \\"weary, half-naked and alone\\". In November of that same year, Stephen was released from prison and restored to the English throne. Sibyl's distress would have been heightened in 1143 after the Bishop of Hereford, Robert de Bethune placed an interdict upon Hereford, blocked all the cathedral's entrances with thorns, and excommunicated Miles. In order to raise money to pay his troops and to assist Matilda financially, Miles had imposed a levy on all the churches in his earldom, an act which the bishop had regarded as unlawful. When the bishop protested and threatened Miles with excommunication, Miles in response, sent his men to plunder the diocese of its resources. In retaliation against Miles' earlier attacks on the royalist city of Worcester and the castles of Hereford and Wallingford, King Stephen bestowed the title \\"Earl of Hereford\\" on Robert de Beaumont, 2nd Earl of Leicester; Miles, however, never surrendered the earldom nor the title to Robert de Beaumont. Widowhood and death While on a deer-hunting expedition in his own Forest of Dean, Sibyl's husband was accidentally shot in the chest by an arrow which killed him on 24 December 1143. He had been involved in legal proceedings against the bishop's jurisdiction when he died. Their eldest son, Roger succeeded him in the earldom. In protest against his father's excommunication, Roger remained an outspoken enemy of the Church until close to the end of his life when he entered a Gloucester monastery as a monk. After her husband's death, Sibyl entered a religious life at Llanthony Secunda Priory, Gloucester, which she had previously endowed. Sibyl was buried in the same priory, the dates of death and burial unrecorded. Sibyl's legacy Upon the childless death of Roger in 1155, the Earldom of Hereford fell into abeyance until 1199 when King John bestowed the title on Henry de Bohun, Sibyl's grandson through her eldest daughter, Margaret. As her sons all died without legitimate offspring, Sibyl's three daughters became co-heirs to the Brecon honour, with Bertha, the second daughter, passing Sibyl's inheritance on (through marriage) to the de Braoses, thereby making them one of the most powerful families in the Welsh Marches. The Brecknock lordship would eventually go to the de Bohuns, by way of Eleanor de Braose. Eleanor, a descendant of Sibyl's through Bertha of Hereford, married Humphrey de Bohun, son of the 2nd Earl of Hereford. Eleanor and Humphrey's son, Humphrey de Bohun, succeeded his grandfather to the titles in 1275.

He was a four-time All-American at 190 lbs and heavyweight, and holds the school record for career wins (169) and single season pins (40, 1980). He won the NCAA Heavyweight championship in 1980 with a perfect record of 46-0 and is one of only five wrestlers to pin every opponent in the NCAA tournament. His dominance at the NCAA tournament garnered him the Outstanding Wrestler Award, the first African-American to win the award. Many major college wrestling programs wanted to sign Harris after his dominant senior year of high school. The day before letters of intent could be signed he announced he would wrestle for Oklahoma. His high school coach, National Wrestling Hall of Fame inductee Jerry Lane, contacted Oregon State wrestling coach Dale Thomas, a two-time national coach of the year and National Wrestling Hall of Fame member himself. Thomas met with Harris that day and convinced Harris that staying in the state would give him an opportunity at a national championship and set him up for success once his college days were over.Jeff Welsch and George P. Edmonston Jr. Tales from Oregon State Sports. Sports Publishing LLC, 2003. p. 173-4. Olympics Harris was a member of the 1980 United States Olympic Team. However, the United States boycott of the 1980 Olympics in Moscow meant Harris couldn't compete. He did compete in the 1981 World Cup of Wrestling where he faced Olympic Champion Sanasar Ognesyan. Ognesyan got the best of Harris, winning by decision. Personal Harris is married with four sons and one daughter.

He also held the offices as the Proctor and Treasurer of the Dhaka University for a long time. He was such a luminary who was the teacher and mentor (Guru) of numerous other luminaries who later earned national and international fame like him. The most famous among them was Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. He also served as a lawyer. He is called \\"Father of Bangladeshi theatre\\" and \\"Natyaguru (or Natya Guru or Natto Guru) of Bangladesh\\" (The Grand Teacher of Drama and Theatre). He was awarded the Bangla Academy Award in 1961, merely a year after its inception. He was also honoured by the People's Republic of Bangladesh with the Ekushey Padak in 1978, only a couple of years after this State honor was introduced.  Early life and education  Momen was born on 25 November 1908. His father was Nurul Arefin, a physician and Zamindar (landlord) in Alfadanga, of the then Jessore district. (After the partition of India, from 1947, Alphadanga is in Faridpur district.) He went to primary school in Calcutta and was admitted in 1916 into Khulna Zila School. At the age of ten he wrote his first poem, Shondhya (Evening), in the same verse as Tagore's Shonar Tory. In 1919 it was published in the journal Dhrubotara. In 1920, he was enrolled in the Dhaka Muslim High School where he resided in the Dafrin Hostel. After matriculation in 1924 he studied at Dhaka Intermediate College. Passing intermediate, he enrolled for a BA at the newly established Dhaka University on 1926. While he was residing at \\"Muslim Hall\\" of Dhaka University, the various halls staged the then new play Muktadhara by Rabindranath Tagore. After some initial resistance, Momen received the main role of \\"Botu\\". This ignited his passion for drama and even earned him the first prize, but it was also the first time that he performed as actor himself. After receiving his B.A. from Dhaka University in 1929, he studied law at the Department of Law, University of Calcutta. Upon completing his B.L. examinations in 1936 he started practicing at the Calcutta High Court. Career= Radio work  After the foundation of All India Radio in Dhaka, 1939, Momen picked up on the opportunity of the new medium and became its first Muslim author. In 1941 he wrote and directed the comedy Rupantor (Transformation) for the radio. With its progressive plot and a female main character it differed vastly form traditional Muslim plays and was actually the first modern drama of Bangladesh. Upon initiative of the critic, the poet and literary critic Mohitlal Majumder, the play was also published in the yearly Puja issue of the newspaper Anandabazar. While he was in London for higher studies from 1948 on, Nurul Momen and his friend Nazir Ahmed started a BBC Bengali program, a weekly one-hour format called Anjuman where Momen was responsible for the literary content.  Teaching career  Rather than continuing to practice law even before the partition of India, Momen joined the faculty of Law at the Dhaka University in 1945. There he was known for including elements from literature and music into the law classes. Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was one of his favourite students, who enrolled in that department in 1948. He encouraged Munier Chowdhury to get interested in theater and become a playwright. Momen encouraged them to read George Bernard Shaw and got many other students interested in theatre. He later translated You Never Can Tell. From 1948 until 1951 Momen was on leave from the university, undergoing higher studies in England and graduating in Law from London University.

Most likely, it targets sodium channel function, thus promoting spontaneous and repetitive neuronal firing. Following injection into mice, it causes non-lethal writhing behaviour.  Sources  South African spitting scorpion (Parabuthus transvaalicus) Bestoxin is one of the many components that can be isolated from the venom of the South African spitting scorpion. Other peptide toxins also found in the venom include dortoxin, birtoxin, and altitoxin. Together with birtoxin, dorotoxin, altitoxin and ikitoxin, this mammal-specific ion channel toxin is a member of the birtoxin polypeptide family. These birtoxin-like polypeptides contribute significantly to the venom's toxicity, since they constitute at least 30% of the peptides in the venom of this scorpion.  Chemistry  Although the birtoxin-like polypeptides, including bestoxin, are 58 amino acids long and have only three disulfide bridges, they resemble long chain neurotoxins, which typically have a length of 60‚Äì70 amino acids and four disulfide bridges. Bestoxin, as most of the known scorpion toxins, has Œ±-helixes that are lined up with basic amino acid residues. Furthermore, bestoxin has localized positively and negatively charged surfaces, a unique property of the birtoxin polypeptide family.  Target & mode of action  Based on its resemblance to long chain Œ≤-neurotoxins, bestoxin most likely binds to neurotoxin receptor site 4 of the sodium channel. Binding of long chain Œ≤-neurotoxins is voltage- independent, and results in a shift of the voltage-activation curve towards more negative potentials, inducing abnormal sodium channel permeability and promoting spontaneous and repetitive firing.https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P0C1B6 - Bestoxin - Parabuthus transvaalicus (South African fattail scorpion)  Toxicity  Mice injected with bestoxin show intense writhing. This abnormal behavior is characterized by twisting of the neck, followed by the body, and making a full turn around the body axis. The intensity of this behavior increases over time and the mice start to spin around. After approximately 24 hours the amount of writhing decreases and the twisting behavior gradually slows down to one turn per two seconds. Furthermore, there is no lethality observed. The dosage that produces a desired effect in 99% of the test population, or ED99, of bestoxin is 100 ng of peptide per 20 g mouse bodyweight. No data is available on the effect of bestoxin in humans or primates.  Treatment  Bestoxin is one of the many neurotoxic peptidic components in the venom of the South African spitting scorpion. The birtoxin-like peptides share an N-terminus of eighteen amino acid residues. Neutralization of this domain results in a decrease of toxicity of the venom. Mass spectrometry and western blotting confirmed that these neurotoxins react with polyclonal antibodies and it is proposed that polyclonal antibodies will neutralize the N-terminus domain and finally the venom in a dose dependent manner. Moreover, previous work has proven that this polyclonal antibody approach is an effective strategy for antivenom production.

The population of the CDP portion of the base was 12,955 at the 2010 census. It is home to the 10th Mountain Division. Fort Drum consists of . In this region, winter temperatures can reach as low as .http://www.drum.army.mil/AboutFortDrum/Pages/AboutFortDrum_lv1.aspx Its mission includes command of active component units assigned to the installation, providing administrative and logistical support to tenant units, support to active and reserve units from all services in training at Fort Drum, and planning and support for the mobilization and training of almost 80,000 troops annually. History This section of the article incorporates text taken from a public-domain document prepared by the United States military. A portion of the present Fort Drum was first used as a military training site in 1908 when it was named Pine Camp; the following year land was purchased to develop the camp as an installation. The army had an earlier presence in the North Country from the early 19th century, prior to the War of 1812. In 1809 the United States stationed a company of infantry soldiers at what was then called Sackett's Harbor to enforce the Embargo Act and control smuggling between northern New York and Canada, particularly Kingston, Ontario. Following the outbreak of the War of 1812, Sacketts Harbor became the center of United States naval and military activity for the Upper St. Lawrence River valley and Lake Ontario. A major shipyard was developed there and twelve warships were completed. The town was rapidly flooded with troops and some 3,000 skilled workers for the navy shipyard, most of whom came from New York City. During the 1830s and 1840s, the Lower Canada Rebellion in Canada prompted a new round of military preparations. The United States purchased land in Sackets Harbor (as it is now spelled), where it developed Madison Barracks, a base for artillery units. Pine Camp In 1908, Major General Frederick Dent Grant was sent to the Pine Camp region to train with 2,000 regulars and 8,000 militia. Grant, the son of Ulysses S. Grant, former United States president and Civil War general, found Pine Plains to be ideal for military exercises. In 1909 the military allocated funds to purchase land to form Pine Camp, and summer training continued here through the years. The camp came into the national spotlight in 1935, when the largest peacetime maneuvers ever were held on Pine Plains and surrounding farm lands. Approximately 36,500 soldiers came from throughout the Northeast to take part in the exercise. Some soldiers traveled by trains, which arrived in town every 15 minutes, coming from as far away as Buffalo, New York and New York City. For 36 hours, young men from offices, factories, and farms marched, attacked and defended in tactical exercises on the the army had leased for its war games. The maneuvers were judged to be most successful and the War Department purchased an additional of land. =LeRay Mansion= The LeRay Mansion, built in the early 19th century, was named after James LeRay de Chaumont. Throughout the years the mansion served as a post commander's quarters, visiting dignitaries' quarters and a location for formal military receptions. Today the mansion is used to house high ranking visitors, which has encouraged the continued upkeep of the mansion. The LeRay Mansion is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. =World War II expansion= With the outbreak of World War II in Europe, Pine Camp was selected by the Army for a major expansion. An additional of land was purchased, displacing 525 local families. Five entire villages were eliminated, while others were reduced from one-third to one-half their size. Three thousand buildings, including 24 schools, six churches and a post office, were abandoned. By Labor Day 1941, 100 tracts of land were taken over. Contractors went to work, and in a period of 10 months at a cost of $20 million, an entire city was built to house the divisions scheduled to train at Pine Camp. Eight hundred buildings were constructed, including 240 barracks, 84 mess halls, 86 storehouses, 58 warehouses, 27 officers' quarters, 22 headquarters buildings, and 99 recreational buildings, as well as guardhouses and a hospital. Construction workers suffered during this period, as the winter of 1941-42 was one of the coldest in North Country history. The three divisions to train at Pine Camp included the 4th Armored Division (Gen. Creighton Abrams was a battalion commander there at the time), the 45th Infantry Division (United States), and the 5th Armored Division. During the war, the post also served as a prisoner of war camp for captured Italian and German troops. Some were allowed to work on area farms during their internment. Of prisoners who died here, one Italian and six Germans are buried in the Sheepfold Cemetery near Remington Pond. Pine Camp was renamed as Camp Drum in 1951, named after Lieutenant General Hugh A. Drum, who was chief of staff of the First United States Army during World War I and First Army commander at the start of World War II. During and after the Korean War, a number of units were stationed and trained here to take advantage of the terrain and climate. In 1959, testing of Agent Orange began on more than of Camp Drum. Several communities at or near Agent Orange manufacturing or storage sites continue to report dioxin levels above recommended safety standards, including Fort Drum. The material was used extensively during the Vietnam War for defoliation. Renamed Fort Drum and after In 1974, a permanent garrison was assigned and Camp Drum was renamed Fort Drum. In April 1980, B Company, 76th Engineer Battalion (Combat Heavy) was reassigned from Fort Meade, Maryland. Three years later the rest of the battalion was transferred here, with the exception of D Company. On September 11, 1984, the announcement was made that Fort Drum would be the new home of the 10th Light Infantry Division. Its mission is to be manned and trained to deploy rapidly by air, sea, and land anywhere in the world, prepared to fight upon arrival and win. The first of the division's troops arrived at Fort Drum on December 3, 1984, and the unit was officially activated on February 13, 1985. The name was changed to the 10th Mountain Division (Light Infantry) at that time. The division reached full strength in 1989. Between 1986 and 1992, 130 new buildings, of roads, and 4,272 sets of family quarters were built at a cost of $1.3 billion. On June 4, 1985, the identity of a roundout brigade was announced that would be composed of Army National Guard battalions. Units from the New York Army National Guard from central and northern New York under the 27th Infantry Brigade made the roundout brigade. On June 28, 1985, the 76th Engineer Battalion was inactivated. In 2013 Fort Drum was being considered for the location of a proposed Eastern United States missile defense site. In 2014, a 60-megawatt biofuel power plant was established to provide energy for the base, part of the U.S. military's push for renewable energy and self- sufficiency.\\"Fort Drum powered by wood in renewable energy push\\", AP, Washington Post, November 23, 2014 In 2015, Diana M.

Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP portion of Fort Drum has a total area of , of which are land and , or 0.65%, are water. The military reservation occupies a large tract in the eastern part of Jefferson County, including parts of the towns of Antwerp, Leray, Philadelphia, and Wilna. The reservation also extends east into the town of Diana in Lewis County. Several villages in Jefferson County are on the border of Fort Drum: Antwerp, Black River, Carthage, Evans Mills, Natural Bridge, and Philadelphia. The nearest city is Watertown, New York, to the southwest, which is the service and shopping destination for the fort's personnel. The Indian and Black rivers flow along part of the reservation boundary. Demographics As of the census of 2000, there were 12,123 people, 2,253 households, and 2,203 families residing in the CDP. The population density was 479.8 per square mile (185.2/km2). There were 2,280 housing units at an average density of 90.2/sq mi (34.8/km2). The racial makeup of the CDP was 64.2% White, 19.8% African American, 0.8% Native American, 2.4% Asian, 0.7% Pacific Islander, 7.6% from other races, and 4.5% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 13.3% of the population. There were 2,253 households, of which 75.3% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 91.9% were married couples living together, 4.3% had a female householder with no husband present, and 2.2% were non-families. Of all households, 2.0% were made up of individuals, and none had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 3.33 and the average family size was 3.36. In the CDP, the population was spread out, with 24.9% under the age of 18, 37.5% from 18 to 24, 36.0% from 25 to 44, 1.5% from 45 to 64, and 0.1% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 22 years. For every 100 females, there were 186.9 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 235.4 males. The median income for a household in the CDP was $31,699, and the median income for a family was $31,202. Males had a median income of $19,779 versus $19,401 for females. The per capita income for the CDP was $13,395. About 6.3% of families and 6.2% of the population were below the poverty line, including 6.8% of those under age 18 and none of those age 65 or over. Syracuse University scrimmage football game at Sligh field (2013) Employment and housing Fort Drum is made up of . There are both on-post and off-post jobs and housing associated with the installation. Civilian job opportunities include day care providers, school teachers, nurses, and custodial workers. There is also a Teen-In-Hire program that helps teens in school obtain jobs. While housing can be difficult to obtain on-post due to the number of families moving to the area, families are able to stay temporarily at the Fort Drum Inn, cottages, guest house, cabins, or the LeRay Mansion, which all are under the care of Fort Drum Lodging. Soldiers and/or their dependents may also stay at one of many hotels surrounding Fort Drum.

The mark has been adopted as the business name of many manufacturers, distributors and sellers of ice cream and frozen yogurt products around the world.  History  The company originated when British businessman Dominic Facchino visited the United States and saw their Mister Softee ice-cream franchise, selling soft-serve ice cream to the public from mobile ice-cream vans. Unable to licence the brand in the UK, Facchino set up his own Mr. Whippy franchise in Birmingham, England, in 1958, starting with a fleet of six vans. Outside of the United Kingdom, the company franchised internationally to Australia in 1962 by sending ten vans on a ship from Southampton to Sydney, following success, a second batch was set the year after, consisting of twenty-four vans. Following great success in Australia, Facchino decided to also franchise in New Zealand, sending twenty four vans over. The company also franchised for a brief time on the Spanish island of Mallorca. Vintage Bedford CF Mr Whippy van in Sydney, Australia, in 2010 The company was purchased in by Wall's and Unilever in 1966. The company's franchise in Australia continued until the mid 1970s, after which the physical vehicle fleet was sold to private operators. During the franchise period from Mr. Whippy in the UK, around two-hundred Commer Karrier vans were imported from the UK to Australia, and fifty Austins were imported into New Zealand. As of present day, in New Zealand, there are around 36 Mr.Whippy franchisees operating 58 vans. General Foods Limited (subsequently Tip Top) acquired the master rights for New Zealand in the early 1980s. The Isuzu Elf became the standard Mr Whippy van and an orange and white colour scheme replaced the original pink and white. In early 2000, Tip Top sold the master franchise to Peter Woodhams, the Waikato Mr Whippy franchisee, who in turn sold the master franchise to Flying Kiwi Holdings (a business owned and run by Nick Cairns, Scot and Geliana Graham) in 2006. The Mr Whippy vans became modernised, using Ford Transit and Fiat Ducato models, various Fuso variants and Tatua replaced Fonterra Brands NZ as the provider of the Mr Whippy UHT ice cream mix.

It was first described in 1909 by the British engineer Henry Parker in his book Ancient Ceylon (1909). Traditionally, the game is only played by women. Rules The game's board (termed olinda-puruwa) comprises 2 rows of 7 pits each. At game setup, four seeds are places in each pit. Seeds of Abrus precatorius are traditionally used. Each player controls one of the rows. At her turn, the player takes all the seeds in one of her pits and sows them. The first player to play may choose whether sowing occurs clockwise or counterclockwise; after that, all sowing will be done accordingly throughout the game. Sowing is called ihinawa. If the last seed is sown in a pit that contains at least 3 seeds, relay-sowing applies. If the last seed falls in an empty pit, or in a pit with exactly one seed (called puta, \\"son\\") or in a pit with exactly two seeds (naga, \\"figlia\\"), any seeds in the opposite pit are captured. Note that the player can either capture seeds from her own or from the opponent's row, depending on whether her sowing ends in the opponent's or her own row. When one of the players cannot move, the game is over. All remaining seeds are captured by the opponent, and the winner is the player who captured most seeds.

As Minister in charge of undivided Mangalore and Chikmagalur, in 1997, he is the reason for the creation of Udupi District, from undivided Mangalore and Udupi. He was also a Member of India's Parliament representing Udupi Chikmagalur Bio Born in Korgi, Kundapura taluk, Udupi district, Jayaprakash Hegde is a practicing advocate and entered politics very early in his life. He has been elected thrice to the Karnataka Legislative Assembly as an independent candidate from the Brahmavara constituency and served as Minister holding the portfolio of Ports and Fisheries. He is married to Veena Hegde and has two children, a son, Nishanth and a daughter, Divya. He was Minister in charge for undivided Mangalore and Udupi District. It is due to his fight and determination that Udupi was finally declared as an independent district in 1997. When his Brahmavar constituency was divided by central govt. and it no longer existed, he was forced to join Congress party for political survival. In 2009 he contested unsuccessfully from the Udupi Chikmagalur for the 2009 Indian general election on an Indian National Congress ticket. Hegde has been elected to Lok Sabha from the same constituency following a by election in 2012. He was the most popular MP the constituency has had and had a tremendous track record of work in only 1.5 years. However, in 2014, because of the unprecedented Modi wave, Shobha Karandlaje, who is a close associate of BJP heavyweight B.S. Yediyurappa defeated Congress candidate, Jayaprakash Hegde, by a margin of nearly one lac votes. The Congress on Monday December 14, 2015 expelled Jayaprakash Hegde, from the party for six years due to his popularity causing insecurities for Rajya Sabha MP Sri Oscar Fernandes. Jayaprakash Hegde being a worker's candidate and not a top leaders follower, faced several issues in the Congress and due to his inability to obey orders of Oscar Fernandes, he was removed from the party without notice. Standing as an independent candidate in the Dakshina Kannada constituency, he gave the Congress party a run for its money, when more than half of the party workers voted for him instead of the official Congress candidate. The Indian National Congress has not seen victory in coastal Karnataka ever since the ejection of Jayaprakash Hegde. His exit has left a big gap in leadership and tea building in Coastal Karnataka Congress. He is said to be on of the cleanest politician in the state, well respected by the general public, media and other politicians. He had successfully completed his MP term by undertaking many good things in few months of term, that couldn't be continued in the next terms by the other MP. Despite being out of power, he continues to do public service and brings in important projects for the constituency. He had refused to return to the Congress party recently, despite repeated requests.

His pupils include his son Jan Frans, Peeter Busschop, Johan Baptist Govaerts, Guielmus van Ryn and Pieter Snyers. Work Alexander van Bredael painted in a wide variety of genres including cattle market scenes, Italianate landscapes and village scenes. He is probably best known for his depiction of festivals and processions set in his native Antwerp. His village scenes are reminiscent of the genre scenes of David Teniers the Younger. He also took his inspiration from other Flemish artists. For instance, his composition A Festival in Antwerp likely drew its inspiration from similar paintings representing processions in cities by Flemish artists such as Pieter van Aelst and Erasmus de Bie.Une procession anim√©e at Musƒóe de Flandre Peter van Aelst, The Ommegang on the Meir in Antwerp, at Jean Moust The Ommegang on the Meir in Antwerp He painted many scenes of cattle markets, which offered him the opportunity to showcase his skill in depicting group scenes populated with many figures as well as his ability to paint animals. He made various Italianate landscapes often including harbour scenes such as the Large pastoral festival among ancient ruins.Alexander van Bredael, Large pastoral festival among ancient ruins, at Hampel auction of 26 June 2009, Munich, lot 248 Alexander van Bredael produced designs for the tapestry workshops in Oudenaarde. In 1698 he is recorded as supplying designs for six tapestries with genre scenes depicting peasants and gypsies.Mengelmaren in: Biekorf. Jaargang 67. E. Vercruysse en Zoon, St.-Andries 1966, p. 117 He provided designs for tapestries that are referred to as Teniers scenes or tapestries. This refers to tapestries related to the Flemish genre painters David Teniers the Younger and David Teniers III. Even though it is not possible to connect the tapestries known as Teniers tapestries, which were woven in numerous weaving centers in Flanders, to any specific designs of these genre painters, these tapestries have been called Teniers tapestries since the early 18th century. Correspondences between the merchant Pieter van Verrren and Alexander van Bredael of 1700 make clear Alexander van Bredael designed some Teniers tapestries. A tapestry depicting an eyeglass vendor was sold at Christie's on 5 February 2003 in New York. It is possible that the landscape in this tapestry was drawn by Pieter Spierinckx, particularly since such a collaboration between Bredael and Spierinckx on Teniers tapestries is mentioned in documents of 1707.Alexander van Bredael, An Oudenaarde Teniers Tapestry at Christie's References An eyeglass vendor, tapestry External links * Category:Artists from Antwerp Category:Flemish landscape painters Category:Flemish genre painters Category:Flemish painters Category:Flemish tapestry artists Category:1663 Category:1720 deaths Category:1663 births ","title":"Alexander van Bredael"},{"id":"29245178","text":"Wales Co-operative Centre is a not-for-profit co-operative development agency in Wales.

The house is today the offices of the New York State Catholic Conference, and the carriage house an architectural firm's office. Buildings Both buildings are near Sprague Place, a short north- south street that connects State and Washington just north of the Washington Park. The house is on a one-acre (4,000 m¬≤) lot taking up, along with a parking lot to the north, the entire west side of the block at the northwest corner of the intersection of State and Sprague opposite the park. The carriage house is on the north side of Washington where it forks to the north from Western Avenue, opposite the intersection of those two streets with Sprague. The surrounding neighborhood is densely developed and urban, with most buildings from the same era, originally designed for residential use. Some mature trees are planted among them, making the transition to the large park to the south less abrupt. House The house is a three-story five-by- five-bay structure of brick laid in Flemish bond, with corner quoins, on an exposed white marble foundation. It is topped by a flat roof pierced by three brick chimneys. On the east (front) facade the two bays flanking the center are on rounded projections. An iron fence with brick posts topped by wooden spheres sets it off from the streets on the south and east. On the first floor of both facades windows are six-over-six double-hung sash. They have marble trim with consoles supporting bracketed cornices and entablatures. Small iron railings are attached to the sills. The second and third floor windows are less elaborate, with marble sills and keystoned lintels. On the east facade, the central window has two narrow flanking windows with the same treatment, and the window above it has a small balcony with iron railing and two small keystoned round windows. To the south, where the middle three bays form a slightly projecting pavilion, the end windows on the second story have narrow flanking windows, and the central windows on the upper stories have balconies. At the roofline is a classically inspired cornice with modillion blocks and guttae topped with a wooden balustrade. The north facade, otherwise similar to the south, has a projecting conservatory in the center. On the west there is no facade as the building is joined to the one next to it along State Street. Marble steps lead up to the main entrance and a marble porch with paired fluted Ionic columns supporting a marble entablature. Above the porch is an iron balustrade forming a balcony. The doorway, in a marble surround, is flanked by two narrow keystoned windows similar to those on the second story. A modern glass and steel door with a transom opens into a central hallway with wooden wainscoting. Decorated lintels are atop the doorways, bridged by a Doric frieze below the ceiling. Its west end is a wooden staircase with three types of Georgian turned balusters. The southeast room is decorated in an Adamesque style, featuring an onyx mantelpiece. To its west is the library, now used as a conference room. Its oak flooring is laid out in a herringbone pattern. Mahogany moldings, chimney breasts and cornice complete the room. The dining room, opposite, is paneled in darker mahogany, complemented by a green marble mantelpiece. Its north wall opens into the conservatory. Next to the dining room is a small breakfast room with mirrors and wooden latticework on its walls. The northeast corner room is done in dark paneling and hand-tooled leather. Another room in the house has a strapped plaster ceiling. The rooms on the second and third stories are more modest, with some having mantelpieces of their own. The billiards room on the third floor has dark paneling and a large fireplace. Carriage house alt=A two-story brick building, similar to but smaller than the house, with an arched entry in the middle Like the house, the carriage house is of brick on a marble foundation, with marble trim. It is two stories tall. At its roofline is a Doric cornice and balustrade. The door and six-over-one double-hung sash windows are capped with flat marble arches. Like the main house, bricks on the south (front) facade are laid in Flemish bond, the other three are in common bond. The north and east facades have windows while the west is blind as it once abutted a neighboring building. Inside its walls were historically unfinished brick and the floor partially paved, with minimal decoration, although that has been changed by the building's adaption for office use. History In 1853, Benjamin W. Arnold of Albany had established his lumber business in partnership with a Michigan man. By the 1880s they were selling lumber from all over the Great Lakes via the Erie Canal. A thousand employees worked in their mills, and the firm had a large portion of dock space on Albany's waterfront. Benjamin Walworth Arnold succeeded his father upon his 1891 death and continued to expand the business. He eventually became president of the Duluth and Northern Minnesota Railroad, and married into the Van Rensselaer family, descendants of the patroons of the area during Dutch Colonial times. By the turn of the century the lumber business in Albany was declining as forests and markets opened up further west. Arnold turned his attentions to more local industries, such as banking, and began giving away money to local causes. In 1904 he commissioned Stanford White, who had worked for Henry Hobson Richardson as a draftsman thirty years earlier on the state capitol but had not built anything of his own in the city, to design a house on the site of an old chapel that was demolished to make way for it, along with a carriage house on a nearby block. It used the new Colonial Revival architectural style, very different from the homes of other wealthy Albany residents built in the area at the time, making it the subject of extended commentary in local newspapers of the time. It was also the first fully electrified home in the city. White, who did not remain in Albany to oversee the construction, was murdered by Harry Thaw two years later, leaving Arnold's buildings as his only work in Albany. Arnold himself died in 1932, after spending the later years of his life as a trustee of many local colleges and a director of local banks. His widow remained in the property until her death in 1945. The estate sold the house to the New York State College for Teachers (now part of the State University of New York at Albany), which used it as a fraternity house and dormitory. Two local auto mechanics bought the carriage house and converted it into an auto repair shop. In 1956 the Roman Catholic Diocese of Albany bought the house and converted its second floor to office space. A decade later they renovated the first floor, and it served as the bishop's residence for some time after that. It is currently the offices of the New York State Catholic Conference. A local insurance company bought the carriage house in 1977 and converted it for office use. It is now used by an architectural firm.

Four subtypes have been identified: AETX I, II, III and K, which vary in their structure and target. Etymology and Source The four subtypes of AETX (Anemonia erythraea toxins) are produced by the sea anemone Anemonia erythraea. Chemistry=AETX I AETX I consists of 47 amino acids. The determined molecular mass appears to be approximately 5 kDa. It is classified into Type I voltage-gated sodium channel neurotoxins. As reported by Norton et al., this group consists of polypeptide neurotoxins with an average of 46-49 amino acids and 27 residues that are highly conserved. AETX I shares 21 of the 27 conserved residues with the representatives of Type I polypeptide toxins from sea anemone. AETX II & III AETX II and AETX III have not yet been categorized since their structure does not correspond to any known polypeptide neurotoxins from sea anemone. AETX II is composed of 59 amino acid residues and has a molecular mass of 6506 Da. AETX III has the same number of amino acid residues and a molecular mass of 6558 Da. AETX II and III are highly homologous with a similarity percentage of 94.9%. Both AETX II and III show sequence similarities to the neurotoxin TxI isolated from Phoneutria nigriventer, an aggressive Brazilian spider. These similarities concern the position of 7 half-cystine (oxidized cysteine) residues in both AETX II and III, consistent with the conserved half-cystine residues throughout the P. nigriventer neurotoxins. The amino acid sequence of AETX I differs from the amino acid sequences of AETX II and III. AETX I is rich in the amino acids asparagine and aspartic acid and has no lysine while AETX II and III both have a high number of half-cystines. All three polypeptides have in common that glycine is the most abundant amino acid. AETX K AETX K is a member of the Type I potassium channel toxin family. However, in contrast to the other members of this family which have 35-37 amino acid residues, AETX K consists of 83 amino acid residues; it has a molecular mass of 3999.3 Da. It shares six conserved Cys residues with the other members of Type I potassium channel toxins. Target and Mode of action AETX I is part of the sea anemone sodium channel inhibitory subfamily 1 and binds to the neurotoxin receptor site 3 of voltage-gated sodium channels, slowing down their inactivation. The mode of action of AETX II and III is not known, but they show structural similarity to spider toxins and therefore may act the same way, i.e. they might activate voltage dependent sodium channels. AETX K belongs to the group of type 1 sea anemone potassium channel toxins. Its lysine-tyrosine pair (21Lys and 22Tyr) seems to be crucial for its binding to potassium channels. Toxicity The against crabs was estimated for AETX I (2.2 ¬µg/kg), II (0.53 ¬µg/kg) and III (0.28 ¬µg/kg). None of these toxins shows a strong toxic effect in mice. The LD50 of AETX K is not known so far, but its 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) was determined as 91 nM.

A 2009 study described this lake of melt water as one of the fastest-growing in the Himalaya. Held in place by a terminal moraine, Imja Tsho threatens downstream communities with the potential for a glacial outburst flood. Imja Tsho has been identified as one of the potentially dangerous lakes in Himalaya. It is located at 27¬∞ 53' 55\\" N latitude, 86¬∞ 55' 20\\" E longitude and at an altitude of 5010 m in Everest region of Nepal. The catchment of Imja Tsho occupies the northeastern part of the Dudh Koshi sub- basin. The lake itself is located on the lower part of the glacier at the toe of its mother glaciers (snout of Imja and Lhotse Shar Glaciers). The Lhotse Shar Glacier flows in a south-westerly direction. The Imja Glacier on the other hand is oriented in a north-westerly direction and has its terminus at about 5100 m. These two glaciers coalesce approximately 3.5 km above the terminus and flow westwards just beneath the trekking path of Imja Tse. An east-facing view of the confluence of Imja Tsho and the Imja Glacier. The lake was first mapped in the form of a few ponds from the satellite image taken in 1962. The total area of the ponds was approximately 0.03 km2 then (27916 sq m). With the melting of glaciers, the ponds merged into a supra-glacial lake in the 1970s and it has grown continuously ever since. The lake area increased to approximately 0.8 km2 (796600 sq m) in 2000 with an average growth rate of 0.02 km2 per year. On the basis of newly released image of 21 November 2009 on Google Earth, the Imja Tsho has attained an area of 1.055 km2 as a result of which the growth rate of the lake has increased to 0.025 km2 per year from 2000 to 2009. The preliminary analysis has also shown that there has been an increase of almost 11% in the lake area compared to the area calculated on the basis of satellite image received on October 2008. In 2016, the United Nations Development Programme together with the Government of Nepal's Nepal Army and Department of Meteorology and Hydrology, with the funding support from the Global Environment Facility (GEF) constructed an outlet and drained over 4 million cubic meters of water from the lake.

N. Swamy, starring Mammootty, Sukumaran, Captain Raju and Urvashi. The film was produced and distributed by M. Mani under the banner of Sunitha Productions. August 1 is loosely based on the 1971 British novel The Day of the Jackal, by Frederick Forsyth.\\"Shaji Kailas starts Mammootty\`s film\\". Sify. 2010-10-12.https://www.navhindtimes.in/the-day-of-the-jackal-cunning-fox/ The film was a commercial success. This film was remade in Telugu as Rajakeeya Chadarangam (political chess) in 1990, with Akkineni Nageswara Rao in the chief minister role and Krishna in the inspector role (played by Mammootty in the original). A sequel titled August 15, directed by Shaji Kailas, and scripted by S. N. Swamy was released in March 2011.  Plot  K. G. Ramachandran, popularly known as KGR, is elected as the new Chief Minister. As a young Turk with a clean image, KGR overshadows Kazhuthumuttam Vasudevan Pillai, who is another strong aspirant for CM's chair. Just after the meeting Kazhuthumuttam joins with Eranjoly Aboobakkar and Mathai Thomas Pappachan at a hotel room to plan the next move. Vishwanathan, commonly referred to as Vishwam, a high-profile business tycoon and political lobbyist, joins them at the hotel. Vishwam, the political sponsor of Kazhuthumuttam, is now in deep trouble as he has several business ambitions in the state. Vishwam has collected several million rupees from several businessmen, whom he had also given promises. If KGR continues in power, his plans would be ruined. KGR, on the other hand, leads a simple life along with his wife Vatsala, a homemaker. He brings out several revolutionary changes in the state, including dismissal of corrupt officers and changes in the liquor policy of the state. Even Kaimal, his party president finds him too arrogant to tame. The popularity of KGR is on a sudden rise. A desperate Vishwam decides to assassinate KGR. He presents the plan to his friends who, though not readily, agree to be part of it. Vishwam contacts Muniyandi Thevar, a Malaysian-based businessman and smuggler in Madras, who introduces him to professional hit man. But after the payment of the amount, Kazhuthumuttam feels cheated as again, he has been denied the CM's post. Kazhuthumuttam, in a state of intoxication, calls up Gopu, a journalist and spits out the information that \\"Chief Minister KGR will be assassinated shortly\\", but without committing his identity. Even though the caller does not give his name, the journalist identifies him as Kazhuthumuttam. He therefore passes the information to a friend of his, Perumal, a police officer (DySP of Crime Branch). Perumal doesn't seem to take this serious at first, and since the identification of the voice of the caller by the journalist is not positive, they conclude it is a prank call. Still they convey the message to the higher officials. The IG of Police, still not thoroughly convinced, orders a routine investigation into the matter. Perumal is assigned the case and he begins his investigation by arresting Vishwam. But Vishwam couldn't give them any further details as he was also unaware about the whereabouts or name of the killer, except that the killer has introduced himself as Gomes, a fake name. Perumal reaches Madras, from where he arrests Thevar and brings him to Kerala. Perumal reaches at the hit man's hiding place. Even though he was not there, Perumal finds out from a newspaper that the CM has been admitted into a hospital. Realising that the hit man went to kill the CM, he rushes to the hospital. Meanwhile, the hit man enters the hospital disguised as a patient. He enters the CM's room and tries to kill him. But it is interrupted by Vatsala. When he gets out of the room, he collides with Perumal and Perumal chases him. He couldn't get out of hospital because Police are everywhere. He hides and attacks Perumal and gets away. According to an eyewitness, Perumal issues a sketch of the killer and gets it broadcast on TV, but he skips from police miraculously. Police search for the hit man everywhere. Perumal arranges security in CM's house and everywhere. Perumal assures the IG that there would be another attempt to kill the CM on Independence day. IG tells him to request the CM to be absent at ceremony because he is CM's friend, which CM denies later. On the day of 15 August, the Independence Day, when the CM is checking the guard of honour, Perumal waits eagerly with all police facilities to grab the killer. While scanning the CCTV feeds, Perumal observes the hit man Gomez among the police in uniform, in the line for the guard of honour. (The assassination setting is very similar to the 30 July 1987, attempted assassination of Rajiv Gandhi, the then Prime Minister of India). Perumal sprints from the Control room and shoots down Gomez, before he can hit the CM, thereby saving KGR. The final scene shows the burial of the would-be assassin Gomez, where Gopu questions Perumal how the killer had got into the guard of honour. Perumal replies that he doesn't know and that had if the killer was alive, then he would have asked him.

It is known from all of Europe, east to Ukraine and central Anatolia. It is also known throughout North America including Nova Scotia, Quebec, Ontario, Wisconsin and California. The wingspan is 6‚Äì9 mm. Adults emerge in May and again in August in two generations in western Europe. The larvae feed on Malus angustifolia, Malus x astracanica, Malus baccata, Malus coronaria, Malus domestica, Malus floribunda, Malus fusca, Malus ringo, Malus x robusta and Malus sylvestris. They mine the leaves of their host plant. The mine has the form of a lower surface tentiform mine. The epidermis is yellow-green and has some folds. Pupation takes place within the mine. The pupa is amber or chestnut brown, and is made within a white cocoon. Control The spotted tentiform leafminer is a serious pest of various apple species (Malus), along with the apple blotch leafminer moth (Phyllonorycter crataegella) and others. Infestation may result in reduced crop yield. Both species, like many other pests, show an increasing resistance to organophosphate and synthetic pyrethroid insecticides. Two species of very small wasps, the eulophid Sympiesis marylandensis and the braconid Pholetesor ornigis are parasites of both P. blancardella and P. crataegella. Biological control includes reducing the use of broad spectrum insecticides, helping these and other parasitoids to flourish and reduce leaf miner damage. Mulching fallen leaves may also allow fragments to be pulled underground by earthworms.

In 2009, longtime friend and musician Jan Osbert Dela Cerna completed the line up. Dela Cerna had to attend to personal matters and is now based in Australia, leaving the bassist spot vacant. Kevin Borromeo assumed bass playing duties in 2013. The band is primarily known for their melodic songwriting, intricate guitar hooks, and electric live performances. History Coming from a lineage of musicians and music enthusiasts (their father, was a grand singing champion for a nationwide-held contest), the brothers primarily decided to form a group back in 2007. The plan was to record a few original songs from their place, and hand them out in CDs as Christmas gifts for their friends and families. They referred to themselves then as Maero, a word taken from a fake version of the popular Nintendo video game character Super Mario, that the boys apparently got hold of. Deciding to take songwriting a little more seriously, they decided to release a rough \\"full-length demo,\\" dubbed \\"At Last, Our First\\" through online social networking sites. This project that contained all original material written by the brothers, officially came out December 23, 2008. By then, the group decided to take on the name Bethany, since the group felt the name's simplicity, form and ambiguity, could work to their advantage. The publicly released demos gathered momentum and instantly garnered favorable attention from students at their hometown. Thus, the group was invited to their first gig at a University festival August 2009. To complete the line-up, the brothers invited their friend Jan Osbert Dela Cerna to play bass for them. The four-piece, ever since then, was known for combining their melodic/poetic songwriting and energetic live acts. In a span of just a little less than a year of gigging, they have been invited to play numerous live, radio, and television shows. Some of these media outlets are NU 107, a rock radio station in the Philippines and RCTV 36, a television station based in Cebu City, Philippines. In 2009, they were one of the notable local bands that played in the Visayan Music Festival. In 2010, they were included in the band line up for F√™te de la Musique (an international Music Festival originating from France) in the Philippines. The group released their debut album on July 2, 2011, dubbed as Fantasy Fool. The band is currently part of the band roster of Sonicboom Events and Music Management, with acts like Urbandub, Hilera, Faspitch, and The Ambassadors. In 2013, the band placed first-runner up in a national band competition dubbed Get Loud, that was sponsored by shoe and apparel brand Converse. Since then, they have announced that the group is working on their second album to be released late 2014. Albums='Fantasy Fool' (2011) The band is releasing their debut album on July 2, 2011 independently. The album, dubbed as \\"Fantasy Fool\\" will contain the same songs from At Last, Our First, but will be far more produced to be more acceptable for airplay. The album is produced by Brian Sacro, Luis Quibranza III and co-produced by the band.

He also depicted genre scenes such as village festivals, processions and a commedia dell‚Äôarte scene. Van Bredael's very imaginative market scenes succeeded in illustrating various aspects of everyday town life.

It is a shrub with stiff, prickly leaves and white \\"daisy\\" flowers, growing up to 2 metres high. Description Olearia erubescens is a spreading woody shrub to high and wide when growing at lower altitudes in grassland and wooded gullies. It has a gnarled smaller growth habit at higher altitudes to high. The branchlets are densely matted with soft whitish T-shaped hairs. The smooth upper leaf surface is dark green, flat and stiff with a distinctive pale network of veins. The leaves are on a short stalk long, arranged alternately, may be either sparse or crowded and end in a sharp point. The leaves are narrowly oval to oblong about long and wide with small, coarse, irregular teeth or slightly lobed serrations along the margin. The leaf underside is thickly covered with white hairs, occasionally reddish when young. The inflorescence consists of 4-8 white flowers, occasionally a pinkish mauve, about in diameter blooming at the end of branches on a peduncle about long. The flower clusters are borne in leaf axils on previous season shoots. The floret centre is yellow. The cone- shaped bracts are arranged in rows of 3-5 and long and covered in dense silky flat hairs. The dry fruit is one seeded, narrowly cylindrical long and ribbed. Flowering occurs from September to January. Taxonomy and naming Olearia erubescens was first formally described by Franz Sieber as Aster erubescens but he did not publish the description. In 1826 Curt Sprengel published the description in his book Systema Vegetabilium. Leopold Dippel in 1889 described Olearia erubescens and published the description in Handbuch der Laubholzkunde. Augustin de Candolle published the description Eurybia erubescens in Prodromus Systematis Naturalis Regni Vegetabilis in 1836 but makes no reference to Sprengels prior description of 1826. The specific epithet (erubescens) is derived from the Latin meaning \\"grow red\\", \\"redden\\" or \\"blush\\" possibly referring to the new growth that is occasionally a reddish colour. Distribution and habitat Moth daisy bush is a widespread species on the coast and ranges from the Blue Mountains, west to Orange and Drake in the Northern Tablelands of New South Wales. Also found in South Australia, Victoria and Tasmania. Grows in rocky situations, sclerophyll forests, woodland and montane forests.

He was one of the founders of the historical school of painting in Belgium and played an important role as a teacher in the development of 19th-century Belgian art.G. Jansen. \\"Van Br√©e.\\" Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 2 Mar. 2014. Biography He was first trained from the age of 10 in the local art academy. One of his teachers was Petrus Johannes van Regemorter. He became assistant-professor at the Academy and got his own studio in 1794. He left for Paris in 1797 where he studied with Fran√ßois-Andr√© Vincent. He participated that year in the Paris Salon and won second prize in the Prix de Rome with his painting The death of Cato in Utica. De intocht van Napoleon te Amsterdam, 9 oktober 1811 by Mattheus Ignatius van Bree He returned to Antwerp in 1804 and became a professor at the Antwerp Academy which had just been reopened after its closure by the French occupiers. Van Bree was after the end of French occupation in 1813 a member of the commission responsible for recovering works of art confiscated by the French and was able to retrieve many works by Rubens. In 1821 he traveled to Italy and visited Florence and Rome with his former pupil Ferdinand de Braekeleer the Elder. In Florence he made in the Uffizi drawings after portraits by Leonardo da Vinci and Raphael. In the same year he also published his views on art in Le√ßons de dessin (Drawing lessons). In 1827 he became director of the Antwerp Academy after the resignation of Willem Jacob Herreyns. He was a member of several overseas art institutions such as the academies of Amsterdam, Rome, Munich and New York. He trained some of the eminent painters of the next generation such as Egide Charles Gustave Wappers, Nicaise de Keyser, Jan August Hendrik Leys, Antoine Wiertz, Jules Victor G√©nisson and Ferdinand de Braekeleer the Elder in whom he instilled his admiration for the masters of the Flemish school, and in particular, Rubens and van Dyck. Egide Linnig who studied under van Bree was not happy with the emphasis placed on history painting by van Bree.N. Hostyn, \\"LINNIG, Egide, marineschilder en scheepsportrettist\\", in Nationaal biografisch woordenboek, (1970), IX 481-486 Work Initially starting out in a French neo-classical style with themes inspired by Antiquity, he changed after the expulsion of the French in 1813 to painting historical pictures based on Dutch and Flemish history. His style also became more reminiscent of Rubens in its use of looser brushwork and a warmer palette. His historical paintings were often of large dimensions and earned him a high reputation in his lifetime. He also painted more small-scale and colourful oil sketches and it is these works that are now most esteemed. He also made a few sculptures. Among his most important works are The Patriotism of the Burgomaster Van der Werft, in the city hall of Leyden, and The Death of Rubens, in the Royal Museum of Fine Arts, Antwerp.

Life  Rutishauser's father died when he was 13 years old and his mother died three years later, so together with his younger brother and sister he went to live in their uncle's home. From 1936, Rutishauser studied mathematics at the ETH Z√ºrich where he graduated in 1942. From 1942 to 1945, he was assistant of Walter Saxer at the ETH, and from 1945 to 1948, a mathematics teacher in Glarisegg and Trogen. In 1948, he received his Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) from ETH with a well-received thesis on complex analysis. From 1948 to 1949, Rutishauser was in the United States at the Universities of Harvard and Princeton to study the state of the art in computing. From 1949 to 1955, he was a research associate at the Institute for Applied Mathematics at ETH Z√ºrich recently founded by Eduard Stiefel, where he worked together with Ambros Speiser on developing the first Swiss computer ERMETH, and developed the programming language Superplan (1949‚Äì1951), the name being a reference to Rechenplan (English: computation plan), in Konrad Zuse's terminology, designating a single Plankalk√ºl program. He contributed especially in the field of compiler pioneering work and was eventually involved in defining the languages ALGOL 58 and ALGOL 60. He was a member of the International Federation for Information Processing (IFIP) IFIP Working Group 2.1 on Algorithmic Languages and Calculi, which specified, maintains, and supports ALGOL 60 and ALGOL 68. Among other contributions, he introduced several basic syntactic features to computer programming, notably the reserved word (keyword) \`for\` for a for loop, first as the German f√ºr in Superplan, next via its English translation for in ALGOL 58. In 1951, Rutishauser became a lecturer; in German, a Privatdozent. In 1955, he was appointed extraordinary professor, and 1962, Associate Professor of Applied Mathematics at the ETH. In 1968, he became the head of the Group for Computer Science which later became the Computer Science Institute and ultimately in 1981, The Division of Computer Science at ETH Z√ºrich. At least since the 1950s Rutishauser suffered from heart problems. In 1964, he suffered a heart attack from which he recovered. On 10 November 1970, he died in his office from acute heart failure. After his untimely death, his wife Margaret shepherded the publication of his posthumous works. In the preface to his text Systematic Programming: An Introduction, Niklaus Wirth referred to Rutishauser as \\"... the originator of the idea of programming languages, and the co-author of ALGOL-60\\".

They include Maltese who have acquired Belgian citizenship, students and workers with International organizations.  Population  Before 2003, the Maltese in Belgium were mostly people married to Belgians who had emigrated to the country or Maltese diplomats. In 2003 the employment of Maltese nationals with the European Union (EU) started in earnest in view of Malta's membership of the organisation. Belgian national statistics show that the number of Maltese in Belgium stood at 252 as of 1 January 2008. Of these, 159 lived in Brussels, 70 in Flanders and 23 in Wallonia. This represents a significant increase over previous years: in 2005 the number of Maltese in Belgium stood at 133 and at 192 in 2006. A more recent estimate quotes the figure of 400 Maltese in Belgium in 2010. The number of Maltese working with the EU institutions and consultative bodies is of 378 in 2016 (an increase over the 365 in 2013 and 324 in 2010). Of these 291 are permanent. As regards EU agencies, they employ 45 Maltese (increase on 33 in 2013), only one of which is permanent.Maltin fil-Belgju  Society  Most of the Maltese are in Belgium because of their employment with the EU. It is in fact estimated that of the 324 Maltese employed with the EU in 2010, around 250 worked in Belgium. This is why they consider themselves to expatriates rather than emigrants as was the case with the Maltese Diaspora in the demographic movements of previous generations. This also explains why most Maltese in Belgium either live in the Brussels-Capital Region or the municipalities bordering this region, in the area in and around the Brussels Ring. The 2008 statistics indicate a community that's more or less evenly balanced between the sexes and whose members are predominantly in the 25-40 age groups.

She was orphaned at an early age and became the ward of Wilfred Evill, a London solicitor and art collector. She attended art school, worked on ballet set design and held a job at Tate Britain. Alongside these artistic pursuits, she was also the adventurous sort who once donned a WW2 diving suit at a friend's party in Wimbledon in order to go diving into the 17th-century well in the backyard. From this first foray into diving onward, Frost was enamoured with the practice, once claiming that, ‚ÄúTime spent out of the water was time wasted.‚Äù Career Frost became a diver soon after Cousteau's invention of SCUBA, and worked as a diver and artist in the early 1950s in France and Italy.Hirschfeld p11 As a member of the world's first scuba diving club, the Club Alpin Sous-Marin, her first experience of the underwater excavation of shipwrecks was with Fr√©d√©ric Dumas.Norton (1999) p. 235 An expedition in Turkey resulted in the discovery of a late Bronze Age shipwreck at Gelidonya, for which Frost is credited as having realised its significance. The wreck had been previously discovered by Turkish diver Mustafa Kapkin and U.S. photo-journalist Peter Throckmorton in 1959. However, it was Frost who recognised that the wreck was not Mycenean, but Phoenician, thus providing the first evidence that Phoenicians had been trading on the seas before the Iron Age. She convinced Joan du Plat Taylor, whom she had met at the Institute of Archaeology in London, to become co-director of the excavation at Gelidonya. It was later the site of George Bass's and Peter Throckmorton's first work in underwater archaeology at Cape Gelidonya in the Antalya region of southern Turkey. The Bronze Age shipwreck, which dated to the 12th century BC, was the oldest known shipwreck in the world at that time.Hirschfeld pp11-12, Norton(1999) p. 234, pp. 248‚Äì252, 253‚Äì258 The excavation of this wreck is of special significance, as it was the first to be conducted following a rigorous scientific approach. In 1968 she led a UNESCO expedition to survey the Pharos site in the Port of Alexandria, for which she was later awarded, in 1997, a French government medal for pioneering submarine archaeology in Egypt.UNESCO (1997); Dept. Culture; Hairy (2006) From 1971 she led the investigation of the Marsala Punic Warship in Sicily, Italy.The Times (2004); Frost (1974), see selected papers In 2005, BSAC awarded her the Colin McLeod award for Furthering international co-operation in diving for her work in archaeology.BSAC (2005‚Äì2010) She died on 12 September 2010.The Times, 17 September 2010; Gambin (2010) The substantial art collection that she had inherited upon Wilfred Evill's death was used to endow the Honor Frost Foundation which supplies funds for underwater archaeology in the Mediterranean.  Personal life  Frost owned a second home in Malta with her primary residence in Marylebone as inherited from Evill, where she possessed a major collection of artworks from 20th-century British painters, especially those by Stanley Spencer. This collection was auctioned after her death, the proceeds of which comprise the bulk of funding for the Honor Frost Foundation.

Whilst at Va≈æec he painted many watercolors which are a permanent reminder of this village. In 1920 he settled permanently in Bansk√° ≈†tiavnica, where he became professor of drawing. His paintings are represented in the Augusta galleries, the Slovak Republic, the Czech Republic, such as the Moravian Gallery in Brno and abroad, and his work is sought after in art auctions. In 1960 he published his autobiography. He died in Bansk√° ≈†tiavnica on 18 February 1970 at the age of 92 years.

In 1984, CC Beat began playing nightclubs in Johannesburg; at the time, they managed to sign with label CCP Records (an affiliate of EMI), but the contract was later dismissed. Another label, Dephon Records, put them under contract shortly thereafter. CC Beat changed their name to 'Taxi' and did sessions for Lucky Dube and other bands. In 1991, the band changed label again, signing for independent label CSR. They recorded their first album, an Eddy Grant tribute entitled The Rasta Rebels. This work was highly successful, to the point that they decided to change the name of the band to Rasta Rebels. At about the same time, Khojane adopted the pseudonym Dr Victor. Dr Victor then recorded a few solo albums, such as Badayo, Hello Afrika, and One Goal, One Wish. All these works were quite successful in South Africa, and Dr Victor was invited to open for international stars such as Paul Simon, Gloria Estefan and Janet Jackson.

Ruth E. Norman (born Ruth Nields; August 18, 1900 ‚Äì July 12, 1993), also known as Uriel, was an American religious leader who co-founded the Unarius Academy of Science, based in Southern California. Raised in California, Norman received little education and worked from an early age in a variety of jobs. In the 1940s, she developed an interest in psychic phenomena and past-life regression. These pursuits led to her introduction to Ernest Norman, a self- described psychic, in 1954. He engaged in channeling, past-life regression, and attempts at communication with extraterrestrials. She married Ernest, her fourth husband, in the mid-1950s. Together they published several books about his revelations and formed Unarius, an organization which later became known as the Unarius Academy of Science, to popularize his teachings. The couple discussed numerous details about their alleged past lives and spiritual visits to other planets, forming a mythology from these accounts. After Ernest died in 1971, Ruth succeeded him as their group's leader and primary channeler. She subsequently began publishing accounts of her experiences and revelations. In early 1974, she predicted that a space fleet of benevolent extraterrestrials, the Space Brothers, would land on Earth later that year, which led the Unarius Academy to purchase a property to serve as the landing site. After the extraterrestrials failed to appear, Norman said that trauma she had suffered in a past life had caused her to make an inaccurate prediction. Undaunted, she rented a building for Unarius' meetings and sought publicity for the movement, claiming to have united the Earth with an interplanetary confederation. She revised the Space Brothers' expected landing date several times, before finally settling on 2001. Her health declined in the late 1980s, prompting her students to try to heal her with rituals of past-life regression. Despite predicting that she would live to see the extraterrestrials land, Norman died in 1993. Unarius has continued to operate after her death, and formed a board of directors. Since the 2000s, leaders have concentrated on individual transformation leading to spiritual change in humankind.  Early life and marriages  Ruth Nields was born in Indianapolis, Indiana, on August 18, 1900. Three years later, her family moved to Pasadena, California, where her father worked as an upholsterer. She and her five siblings were reared there, receiving little education and working from a young age. As a teenager, she labored as a fruit packer and a maid. Most of her income went to her father, whom she later described as abusive. In 1918, she married a man named Frank R. De Silvas and they had a daughter two years later. The couple divorced in the early 1920s; Frank gained custody of their daughter, although Ruth had access as well. Little is known for certain about Ruth's life from the mid-1920s to the 1940s, but she worked in a variety of jobs. She held positions in several restaurants and also worked as a model, real-estate broker, resort manager, and nanny. In the 1940s, she enrolled at the Church of Religious Science, where she studied New Thought under Ernest Holmes, and was separately introduced to psychic healing in that decade. Over time, she also became interested in spiritualism, channeling, and past-life regression. She married Benjamin Arnold in the 1940s; the marriage lasted until his death in 1951. Two years later, she remarried and settled in Lancaster, California. Her third husband, George Marian, owned a milk-delivery business which Ruth helped him to manage. In the mid-1950s, she became interested in acting and earned the starring role in a local play.  Marriage to Ernest Norman  In 1954, at a psychic event in California, Ruth was introduced to Ernest Norman, who told her that in a past life she had been the daughter of an Egyptian Pharaoh and had protected Moses. Members of the organization they later established, the Unarius Academy of Science, affirm that Ernest and Ruth married on the day they met, and the group celebrates their anniversary as February 14, 1954. However, Diana Tumminia of California State University, Sacramento, notes in her 2005 study of the group that Ruth was probably still married to George Marian in early 1954 and speculates that their divorce was a lengthy process; Tumminia posits that Ernest and Ruth married in 1956. Ernest believed he could communicate with both extraterrestrials and historical figures, channeling messages from them. In 1954, seeking to popularize his channeling, Ernest and Ruth formed an organization known as Unarius, operating from their home in California. After their marriage, Ruth served as Ernest's typist, later claiming to have learned the skill while sleeping. She recorded the information he channeled, writing books about psychic healing and trips into the solar system. In the 1950s and 1960s, they attracted several followers, including two students whom they later taught to channel. One early trainee was Charles Spiegel, who later led the group. Many converts had previous involvement with New Age or mystic groups, making it easy for the Normans to convert them. Converts were provided with elaborate details of Ernest and Ruth Norman's purported spiritual visits to other planets. The couple believed that humans could learn from great teachers on these journeys; Ernest said that this contact held the potential to educate and heal humanity. Ernest also spoke of the scientific advancements of other worlds. The couple also discussed revelations about their past lives, including Jesus and Mary of Bethany among their past identities. Ruth stated that she had lived about 50 lives over several million years; she recalled being several well-known and a few obscure people on Earth, as well as beings from other planets and an archangel. Their group developed a mythology from the accounts that Ernest and Ruth gave of these lives, including tales from their past incarnations in Atlantis and Lemuria. Some of their stories were similar to the plots of contemporary books and films, prompting Tumminia to cast their beliefs as a pastiche or bricolage of the surrounding culture. Ernest and Ruth promoted millennialist teachings, holding that higher beings were to transform the Earth and bring devotees to a new level of existence; the couple held that this growth would allow people to travel through space. Zeller compares their millennialist doctrines to those of Christian dispensationalism, noting their shared utopian views.  Leadership and death of Ernest  Nikola Tesla, to whom the group attributed several documents, experimenting in 1899 Ernest died in 1971; thereafter, Ruth led their organization and served as its primary channeler. Spiegel moved to San Diego to assist her. After Ernest died, Spiegel affirmed Ruth's nascent belief that she was an archangel named Uriel from the \\"fourth dimension\\". In 1972, Ruth Norman began publishing Tesla Speaks, a series of messages that she said were given to her by the American inventor and engineer Nikola Tesla from his dwelling in outer space; she stated that he also relayed messages from scientists Albert Einstein and Louis Pasteur to her. Norman asserted that the Tesla Tower held secrets which were to be recovered by Unarius. The American journalist Alexander S. Heard argues that Tesla's rumored interests in death rays and free energy drew the group to him. In 1973, Norman recounted an experience in which she spiritually married the archangel Michiel at a lavishly decorated temple on another planet; the event was said to have culminated with her being crowned the Queen of Archangels, Uriel, by the Archangel Raphiel. She and Spiegel envisioned the events of the ceremony over several days, and she published their recollections later that year. Her students subsequently referred to her as Uriel, an acronym of \\"universal, radiant, infinite, eternal light\\". She and Spiegel re-enacted the ceremony for her followers, and the group celebrated the anniversary of the event annually. After her spiritual marriage, Norman increased her channeling of historical figures, including Plato, Tesla, and John F. Kennedy.  Prophecy and therapy = First extraterrestrial prophecy  In a volume published in March 1974, Norman predicted that a spacefleet of an \\"Intergalactic Confederation\\" was to land on Earth before December 1974. In November 1974, assisted by some of her students, Norman purchased a property near Jamul, California, to serve as a landing site for extraterrestrials, whom she referred to as the \\"Space Brothers\\". At some point in 1974, Norman revised the date at which she expected extraterrestrials to land to September 1975, citing ongoing Confederation efforts to prepare humanity for their landing as the reason for the delay. She predicted that a single flying saucer would bring extraterrestrials to persuade humans of their teachings, after which another 33 vessels would arrive. These beings were to restore the lost teachings of Atlantis to the Earth, and their revelations were to free humanity from crime and disease, ushering in an era of learning. She believed that this information would be imparted by a thousand extraterrestrial scientists, who would also bring advances in technology, among which she specified crystal computers, to Earth. Norman presumed that Confederation leaders were to take her on a world tour after their arrival, and she bought herself a new wardrobe in preparation. In addition, she arranged a large banner to welcome them, made arrangements for buses to the landing site, and informed the National Enquirer, an American tabloid, of her expectations. In early September 1975, she gave a farewell message, telling of her future home on a spaceship. On September 22, however, she concluded that a landing would not occur and stated that she was reliving the trauma of a past life‚Äîin which she was Isis‚Äîwhen she was assassinated shortly before extraterrestrials were to land. She explained that the effects of this trauma had caused her to make an inaccurate prediction. Norman led the group in classes to teach them how to relive the event that had culminated in Isis' assassination and took them to the expected landing site to stir their memories. They began to hold public meetings again in November. Several students doubted Norman's explanation; some of them left the group. In 1975, Norman used the proceeds of a home sale to rent a storefront for her group's meetings, which they lavishly decorated. She purported to be the \\"Spirit of Beauty\\" and the \\"Goddess of Love\\"; in this capacity, she claimed complete knowledge of truth and the ability to heal. After their new headquarters opened, Norman told her students‚Äîand the media‚Äîthat she was an ambassador from the Interplanetary Confederation, and, in February 1975, she opened the Academy of Parapsychology, Healing, and Psychic Science, which soon became known as the Unarius Academy of Science. The group celebrates the anniversary of the union of Earth and the confederation annually around October 12\\\\.  Past-life therapy and subsequent prophecies  Norman pioneered a form of past-life therapy, teaching her disciples how to recall details of experiences from their past incarnations. These recollections contributed to the group's mythology, which developed over time with student input. Unarius' members occasionally recalled crimes that they had committed in past lives, including times they harmed incarnations of Ruth Norman. The students sometimes acted out and filmed scenes from their previous incarnations, an experience that participants found therapeutic; they cited this benefit as proof that the events were real. Norman's therapy, according to R. George Kirkpatrick of San Diego State University and Tumminia, differed from most New Age past-life therapies in the way that it wove her followers into the group's narrative. In March 1976, Norman publicly wagered $4,000 with the British gambling firm Ladbrokes that extraterrestrials would land on Earth within one year, a prediction which attracted media attention. Tumminia states that Norman had \\"no public distress\\" over the failure of her prediction. Despite the negative publicity from the prophecy's failure, new members were attracted to the group. After losing the wager, Norman changed the expected landing date to 2001; she taught that the close of the 20th century coincided with the beginning of a new cycle which would bring great benefits to humanity. Representatives of Unarius later stated that the prophecies had been misunderstood and that the Space Brothers had not visited because humanity was not yet ready for them. They have argued that Unarius' teachings must be understood to correctly interpret Norman's statements. Tumminia writes that they used \\"adaptive storytelling and continuous narrative invention\\" to explain the failure of the prophecy. The group enjoyed publicity, and media outlets regularly covered them. Most journalists portrayed Unarius as a curiosity and accentuated its novel aspects. In the area near their headquarters, they were viewed as an unusual group with strict behavioral standards. One local writer published a sensationalist account of the group under the title \\"The Gods Must Be Crazy\\". But, after interviewing Norman in 1976, Brad Steiger, who has written extensively about the paranormal, gave a positive account of Unarius. Norman disliked academic writings about her organization, seeing them as unfairly negative.  1980s and 90s  In 1979, Norman claimed to have an unofficial following of more than 100,000. That year, she announced a spiritual promotion: she was no longer an archangel but, with Michiel, a \\"Lord of the Universe\\" and a \\"Prince of the Realm\\". She renamed Spiegel as \\"Antares\\" in 1984, stating that he had overcome the evil of his past incarnations; he subsequently began to channel. As of 1986, the group had about 450 regular students and charged $5 per class. At that time, Norman lived in a house in La Mesa, California, with two of her disciples. In the mid-to-late 1980s, Unarius \\"mini documentaries\\" featuring \\"Uriel\\" aired as far east as the New York City region, in Westchester County (for one), on public access television. Assisted by her followers, Norman recorded her teachings in about 80 books. She wrote educational materials designed to empower students by teaching them about subjects such as the \\"psychology of consciousness\\" and \\"self-mastery\\". Ernest and Ruth Norman's writings are revered as scripture by members of the Unarius Academy. The group developed a set of six core sacred narratives about the past lives of its founders, describing key events on Earth and other planets. These myths featured tales of romance, war, and scientific advances in the Aries and Orion constellations and in ancient civilizations on Earth. Kirkpatrick and Tumminia state that the Unarian canon appears to be incoherent to outsiders, but is appreciated as a cohesive body of literature by the group's members. Norman wore a variety of brightly colored, elaborate costumes and was often photographed by media while wearing royal-style gowns and wigs and holding a scepter. She stated that her habiliments mirrored the practices of extraterrestrials, whose attire she said was brighter and more radiant than clothing on Earth. At the group's headquarters, she had a gold-colored throne that was decorated with peacock feathers. Her assistants helped shepherd her media image; Kirkpatrick and Tumminia speculate that her charisma was primarily responsible for gaining publicity for the group. Followers of Norman held her in high regard: they occasionally fainted when she touched them, and some wept when allowed to meet with her. They painted several portraits of her, one of which they believed had healing powers. According to students, Norman healed them in their dreams and sometimes reported seeing visions of her. Several times, group members chose to forgo cancer treatment, trusting in Norman to heal them. Tumminia says that Norman was a clear example of the German sociologist Max Weber's concept of charismatic authority. Norman sometimes had disagreements with students and excommunicated two senior assistants who questioned her, although she welcomed one back a few years later. If healing was unsuccessfully sought, the failure to receive it was sometimes attributed to disloyalty to leadership. Criticism of Norman was not tolerated by the group; Tumminia describes Norman's leadership style as \\"benign authoritarian\\".  Declining health and death  In 1988, Norman broke a hip and her health began to decline. Although she had promised to live until 2001, her deteriorating condition made her followers suspect she would die before then, causing them some distress and denial. In an attempt to help her recover, students used past-life regression to recall interactions with her, and some became very emotional after experiencing memories of events in which they had rejected and hurt her. Norman returned to leading services in February 1989, making a quicker than expected recovery, which was attributed to the past-life rituals. After a period of good health, her condition again deteriorated, prompting students to resume recounting their past crimes. Norman lost most of her hearing and experienced chronic pain; she was admitted to a hospital in December 1989, but by the summer she was well enough to be present at events. She was nearly bedridden in her last years and was attended to by some followers. In 1991, she stated that the Space Brothers had given her permission to die before their expected arrival in 2001. Before her death, Norman met with each of her followers; she died on July 12, 1993, and was cremated. In her will, she promised to return to Earth, accompanied by the Space Brothers, in eight years. Students, some of whom were surprised and confused by her death, were instructed by leaders not to grieve because she was in a celestial state. Some of them privately mourned, and a few left the group. Items of Norman's were distributed to students, some of whom wore them at later events. After Norman's death, Antares took over as leader and channeled messages from her. Others later began channeling her, and recordings of her messages were replayed. Antares died in 1999, and a board of directors assumed leadership of the organization and channeled. In the 2000s, Unarius' leaders emphasized individual transformation, focusing on a gradual spiritual change in humanity.  Legacy  Images of Norman have been used to attract attention by some outside of the Unarius Academy of Science. In 1996, an MTV executive viewed a picture of Norman and decided to use her image in an advertising campaign for the MTV Music Video Awards. The network contacted the Unarius Academy of Science and received permission to use a look-alike in their promotions. In 2000, Norman was featured on the cover of Kooks: A Guide to the Outer Limits of Human Belief, a book about personalities with fringe beliefs. After Norman's death, public opinion of her organization was strongly influenced by the 1997 mass suicide of Heaven's Gate, a UFO religion whose members occupied a house within of the Unarius Academy of Science. In the suicides' aftermath, some reporters and members of the anti-cult movement described Unarius as a similar group. Tumminia disagreed with this portrayal, casting Unarius' practices as no more dangerous than those of widely accepted religions.

It is located between the cities of Tilburg and Hilvarenbeek in the south of the Netherlands. The visitors can for instance watch zebras and giraffes on the spacious savannahs. Safaripark Beekse Bergen offers the possibility to explore the park on numerous safaris: walksafari, carsafari, bussafari and boatsafari. The park is owned by the company Lib√©ma Exploitatie BV, which is one of the largest leisure-related companies in the Netherlands. What makes the park so special is that visitors can explore the park with their own car, without a fence in between the visitor and the animals. While driving through the park people can for instance encounter leopards and zebras or get their car 'washed' by a giraffe. In this way the visitor can imagine that they are really taking a safari in Africa. Visitors can also choose to follow the same route per bus. In this way they will get to know more information about the animals, since they will be joined by a Ranger. Besides these two ways of exploring the park, the visitor can also choose to take a boat, that plies between two piers in the park. The visitors can also watch the animals by foot on the approximately 5 kilometres of roads throughout the park. All of the above-mentioned safari possibilities can be combined. All the safaris start at the front of the park and come together at a parking side at the backside of the park, close to the Kongorestaurant. Another feature of the park for which it is very well known is its bird show. In this show full of humour and interesting facts all sorts of birds are shown to the audience. All animals receive a strict diet, as a result of which feeding the animals is prohibited. History In 1968 the ‚ÄúLion Park Beekse Bergen‚Äù was opened, in which visitors could observe lions from their car. Because this idea was new for the Netherlands it became a major success. Two years later two extra terrains were opened, in which leopards and baboons could be seen. In the next four years seven more types of animals were added to the park, for instance zebras, giraffes and an elephant. Because the park did now not only concern lions anymore, the name was changed in 1974 into Safaripark Beekse Bergen. In 1980 the total size of the park had grown to 120 hectares and six more types of animal had been added. Until that point there had only been a car safari, but in 1982 a walking safari was opened. This was only at a small part of the park, but it gave the visitors a chance to observe various sorts of animals which were too small to be shown in the open car safari areas. Furthermore, a bird show was opened in 1984, which was another unique experience for the Netherlands. In the years that followed the park became less popular and it looked like the Safaripark would go bankrupt. However, in 1987 the organization Lib√©ma bought the park and with this new owner the park started evolving again. The walking safari was enhanced and a bus safari and boat safari were added. Today Lib√©ma is still the owner and the Safaripark Beekse Bergen has become the fourth zoo of the Netherlands. Since a few years Lib√©ma is also the owner of Speelland Beekse Bergen, which is an amusement park for families with children. This park is located adjacent to the Safaripark Beekse Bergen and therefore these two parks are working together more and more. For instance, the park manager of the Safaripark is also the park manager of Speelland and also the shops are working as one. The idea is to let the two parks become in line with each other more, so that a day-trip to the Beekse Bergen really becomes a day-trip to Africa. Objectives Safaripark Beekse Bergen has a few idealistic objectives. The park wants to contribute to the conservation of nature in de broadest way of the word. They do this by means of: * conservation of threatened species * education * scientific research * active participation in worldwide conservation programmes. To support these objectives, Safaripark Beekse Bergen participates in a number of organisations: * NVD = Dutch Association of Zoos * SDH = Foundation Zoos Help, the nature conversation programme of the NVD * EAZA = European Association of Zoos and Aquaria Furthermore, Safaripark Beekse Bergen participate in the following conservation programmes: * African wild dogs in Zimbabwe * Siberian tigers and Amur leopards in Siberia * Sloth bears in India Breeding programmes As a member of EAZA, Safaripark Beekse Bergen cooperates with European management programmes for threatened species such as the European Endangered Species Programme (EEP) and European Studbooks (ESB). The threatened species in the collection of the safari park are: red ruffed lemur, ring-tailed lemur, African wild dog, leopard, African elephant, white rhinoceros, Gr√©vy zebra, Rothschild giraffe, African penguin, white-cheeked gibbon, red panda, Siberian tiger, Przewalski horse, Mesopotamic deer, Vietnamese sika deer and Chilean flamingo. Besides EEP Safaripark Beekse Bergen also participates in European Studbooks (ESB). These are animals that are being observed intensively and have a chance to become a threatened species in the future. Safari Beekse Bergen participates in this programme for: spotted hyena, warthog, sitatunga, markhor, sable antelope, blesbok, white-handed gibbon, sun bear and squirrel monkey.'' Animals The word 'safari' for many people is a reference to Africa. The park's name is an indicator that it focuses on conserving and observing African animals. Although the park's history and the weather in the Netherlands make a 'realistic African experience' nearly impossible. During the 1990s, the park attempted to provide visitors 'a journey around the world in one day', and has sections devoted to the fauna of the American, Asian, European and Australian continents. The European section has been removed, with scottish highlands cattle and European red deer being the only remnants of those times. The Australian section now contains only some giant kangaroos and emus. The American section still houses the selection of small animals it originally contained, including capybaras, squirrel monkeys and guanacos. In the future, all these animals will be moved to other zoos or are put into conservation programmes. Ultimately, only African and a few Asian animals will remain and the park will be able to focus on its 'One day in Africa!' theme.

It can accommodate up to 5,000 worshippers and is famous for hosting four different Islamic traditions. History Ulu Cami (Great Mosque) on 15 September 1919 The mosque as it is known today was built in 1091 by the Seljuk ruler Malik-Shah. The design influenced by the Umayyad Mosque in Damascus, used the locally found black basalt rock. The mosque suffered extensive damage in a fire in 1155. The Great Mosque of Diyarbakir is the oldest and one of the most significant mosques in Mesopotamia. Following the Muslim capture of Diyarbakir in 639 during the reign of the second Caliph Umar, a mosque was built, but the building fell into disuse and ruin sometime later. Even after the conversion of the church into the mosque, it was used by both Muslims and Christians. In 1091 Sultan Malik Shah directed the local Seljuk governor Maidud Davla to rebuild a mosque on the site. Completed in 1092, the mosque is similar to and heavily influenced by the Umayyad Great Mosque in Damascus (which was repaired by Malik Shah in the twelfth century prior to work in Diyarbakir). The influence of the Damascus mosque brought Syrian architecture and decoration to Anatolia. The portal of the mosque is carved with two lions attacking two bulls. The mosque consists of a prayer hall which makes up the entire south wall of the courtyard, three aisles which together are more than twice as wide as they are deep. The high roof of the central hall is made of timber trusses, supported by rows of rectangular stone piers. The mosque is actually a complex of buildings around a courtyard long by wide. The fa√ßade of the courtyard is highly decorated two-story colonnade on the east, south, and west sides, with only one story on the north side. The western fa√ßade, rebuilt by the Atabek Inaloglu Abu Mansur ƒ∞laldƒ± between 1117 and 1125 following an earthquake and fire in 1115, reuses columns and sculptural moldings from a Roman theater. The architect Hibat Allah al Gurgani was responsible for both that reconstruction and the square minaret rising above the qibla wall. Also included in the complex are the Mesudiye Medresesi (1193) and, not connected to the courtyard, the Zinciriye Medresesi (1189) . The center of the courtyard has an Ottoman (1849) shadirvan (ablution fountain) and a platform for praying; both block a clear view through the courtyard. Many Kufic inscriptions record in detail the rebuilding and additions made to the complex throughout its long history. Lavish carving and decoration of the columns of the courtyard are one of the distinguishing features of the Great Mosque. The western arcade of the courtyard includes the first use of the broken arch.

In September 2010, after years of weighting, Gianfranco Miccich√©, long-time leader of Forza Italia and, later, The People of Freedom (PdL) in Sicily and Under-Secretary in the Berlusconi IV Cabinet, announced his exit from the PdL and his intention to launch a \\"Sicilian people's party\\", which would have then merged with other southern \\"people's parties\\" to form the \\"Party of the South\\". In October 2010 Force of the South was launched. Only five out of 16 regional deputies of the PdL‚ÄìSicily, the faction of the PdL led by Miccich√©, followed their leader into the new party. The party was officially launched during a convention in Palermo on 30 October 2010, which was attended also by Stefania Prestigiacomo, who, although very supportive of Miccich√©, chose to stay in the PdL. In that occasion Miccich√© announced that some 25 deputies and senators were ready to join FdS. Finally only ten have managed to do so: they include seven deputies (Giuseppe Fallica, Ugo Grimaldi, Maurizio Iapicca, Gianfranco Miccich√©, Antonino Minardo, Francesco Stagno D'Alcontres and Giacomo Terranova) and three senators (Roberto Centaro, Mario Ferrara and Salvo Fleres), all elected in Sicily. FdS soon broadened its scope throughout the South. In May 2011 the party had promising results in Naples (5.2%) and Reggio Calabria (4.7%), while in October it gained 6.5% of the vote in a regional election in Molise. On 14 July 2011 FdS launched, along with We the South and I the South, the Federation of the South, later Great South, a coalition which aimed at becoming the party of the South. In January 2012 FdS formed a sub-group in the Mixed Group of the Chamber of Deputies, which included the seven FdS deputies and two new entries (Aurelio Misiti, a former member of Italy of Values who was appointed chairman, and Gerardo Soglia, from the PdL), but not the three deputies of NS.

Opened in 2006 by founder and director Eugene Cussons, in collaboration with the Jane Goodall Institute (JGI), its purpose is to provide a permanent and safe home for chimpanzees who are rescued from abusive and unfortunate circumstances from areas where these great apes are being constantly exploited by humans through the bushmeat trade, pet trade and entertainment industries. At the sanctuary, the chimps are rehabilitated with the help of their care takers in being re- introduced back into chimpanzee social skills such as learning how to climb trees and live in a social group with others of their own kind. Chimp Eden is the only sanctuary for chimpanzees within South Africa. Part of the reserve it is home to game animals such as giraffes, zebras etc, which are also managed and conserved by the director of Chimp Eden. Chimp Eden has rescued chimpanzees from Angola, Sudan, Mozambique, Italy and rescued chimpanzees from the Johannesburg Zoo. Chimp Eden is a member of the Pan African Sanctuary Alliance. Chimpanzee enclosures=Juvenile enclosure 1 This enclosure contains 14 chimpanzees, all rescued individuals. Zacarias, an adult male who was rescued from Angola after being found chained to a tree outside a nightclub in Luanda, was the dominant male in this group before being overthrown by Thomas. Joao is an old male who was kept at a zoo in Mozambique. The other members of the group also include Cozy, was found rescued from Italy where he was kept in solitary confinement and needed rehabilitation into social skills. There were also two young females, Zeena, who was rescued from the United Arab Emirates and Sally, who was rescued from Luanda, Angola. In April 2007, five baby chimps (Charlie, Nina, Thomas, Dinka and Zee) were rescued from Sudan where they were all victims of the bushmeat trade. All have also settled in remarkably well. The two others, Sampa and Tony, were rescued from Angola where they were being confined to an inhospitable cage. Tony was found to have a cataract in one of his eyes and after a risky operation, he has regained sight in his eye. Claudine and Claude were also added to the group, but Claude has subsequently been transferred to the adult group where he is also being introduced to both Amadeus and Nikki. Currently in the group are alpha males and females Zacarias, Joao, Cozy, Sampa, Tony, Dinka, Zee, Nina, Sally, Zeena, Charlie, Thomas and Claudine. As of April 2013, Nina and her son Thabu, are ongoing a reintegration process after Nina was separated from the group to give birth to Thabu in January 2013. Juvenile enclosure 2 This enclosure contains 12 chimpanzees, all rescued individuals. Charles, who was rescued from an entertainment circus in South Africa and arrived in December 2008, is the dominant male in the group. The group also contains two adult females, Jessica the dominant female who was rescued from the entertainment circus in South Africa and Martha, who was rescued from being kept in solitary confinement in Ghana. In July 2008, seven babies (Charlene, Marco, Mowgli, Azzie, Bazia, Mary and Tamu) were rescued from Sudan where they were all victims of the bushmeat trade. The other two, Suzie who was rescued from the entertainment industry and Lily, who was a victim of the bushmeat trade. Currently in the group are alpha male and females Charles, Jessica, Martha, Suzie, Lily, Marco, Bazia, Mary, Charlene, Mowgli, Tamu and Azzie. Adult enclosure This enclosure contains 8 chimpanzees, all rescued individuals and is also the only group composed of adults. Amadeus, who was relocated to the sanctuary from the Johannesburg Zoo, is the dominant male in the group. Amadeus also took over the group after former alpha male Abu, who was relocated to the sanctuary from the Johannesburg Zoo, died. The other members also include Nikki, who was ultimately rescued from being kept as humanized, is the second ranking male. The females also include Jinga, the dominant female who was rescued from a liquor factory, Mimi, who was rescued along with Jinga, Lika, who was rescued from a solitary cage in Luanda, Angola, Josephine, who was rescued from a solitary confinement in a shipping container in Luanda, Angola, and Claudette, who was relocated to the sanctuary from the Johannesburg Zoo. Claude was rescued from Central African Republic and originally introduced to juvenile group 1, but has recently been moved to this enclosure and is also being introduced to both Amadeus and Nikki. Currently in the group are alpha males and females Amadeus, Nikki, Claude, Jinga, Mimi, Josephine, Claudette and Lika. Accommodation Chimp Eden also has rustic Wendy house accommodation (en-suite twin bedded rooms in wooden huts) where visitors can rent a place to stay during their visit. There are volunteer programs which enable the recruitment of sufficient keepers as well as adoption scheme which enables the sanctuary to continue its rescue and rehabilitation work with the chimpanzees. Escape to Chimp Eden The Chimp Eden sanctuary was featured on the Animal Planet television series, Escape to Chimp Eden. The program covers the work at the sanctuary, daring rescue missions carried out by Chimp Eden founder and director, Eugene Cussons and human elements. 2012 chimpanzee attack on staff member According to an online news story article written by Rohit Kachroo and other staff from MSNBC World News, and posted on Friday, 29 June 2012,: \\"An American studying chimpanzee behavior in South Africa was \\"fighting for his life\\" after he was attacked by two of the chimpanzees, according to a report. ...\\" The article stated that the student, Andrew F. Oberle, a primatology graduate student researcher and St. Louis area native in the master's degree program in anthropology at the University of Texas at San Antonio who had been acting as a tour guide, had been rescued by paramedics with an armed escort after the park's owner fired shots at and wounded one of the chimpanzees and fired into the air. He was stabilized, and taken to the Nelspruit, South Africa MediClinic Hospital near Johannesburg; as of that weekend he is in critical but stable condition after a six-hour emergency surgery.

Background Following the release of his previous album, Change We Must, in October 1994, Anderson took a break after touring with the rock band Yes before he started to write and record music for a new album. By 1995, Anderson had met his future wife Jane Luttenberger who became a significant inspiration to his life and the music he would write since the mid-1990s. A photograph of the couple is included on the album's liner notes. Angels Embrace was recorded in 1995 with Anderson as producer, and mixed at Opio Studios in Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles. In a departure from his previous work, the album sees Anderson explore instrumental and ambient music. He had wanted to compose a \\"peaceful work\\" for some time, which \\"plays quietly and embraces the whole room\\", and used several pieces of musical ideas that he had written and collected over the years as inspiration. Anderson named the album after a pastel painting by English artist Jack Shalatain titled \\"The Angels Embrace\\".

Voters voted on amendments to the Constitution of American Samoa which had been approved by a Constitutional convention held from June 21 through July 2, 2010,Government of American Samoa, p. 20 the 4th such convention. The changes were ultimately rejected by a majority of over 4,000 votes. Proposed changes There were a total of 34 or 39 proposed amendments to the Constitution. At a Constitutional convention in the middle of 2010, the subject of autonomy for American Samoa was discussed, with the issue being raised by the territory's non-voting member in the United States House of Representatives, Eni Faleomavaega. Resulting from this, the proposed Constitution replaced all mentions of \\"Government of American Samoa\\" with \\"American Samoa Government\\".Government of American Samoa, pp. 6‚Äì16 Additionally, a paragraph in the preamble to the Constitution was proposed to be changed to reflect that American Samoans should \\"have and enjoy certain rights ... including the right to local self-government\\".Government of American Samoa, p. 5 Furthermore, if the changes were accepted, any federal American law seen as being harmful to the economy of the territory or the welfare of American Samoans could be blocked by the Fono. Other proposed changes to the Constitution included expanding the American Samoa House of Representatives from 20 members (plus one non-voting member from Swains Island) to 25 (plus one), and the American Samoa Senate from 18 to 22 members.Government of American Samoa, p. 9 The power of the Governor of American Samoa's veto would have changed with the introduction of veto override into the Constitution, whereby a bill passed by a two-thirds majority by both houses of the American Samoa Fono within 14 months of an original veto will become law immediately.Government of American Samoa, p. 13 As the referendum failed, any vetoed law re-passed by the Fono still requires further approval by the Governor or the United States Secretary of the Interior. A prior referendum on the issue in 2008 failed by 112 votes, after original results showed a mere 22-vote margin. The revised draft included a proposal to effect an order of succession should the office of Governor or Lieutenant Governor of American Samoa be vacant.Government of American Samoa, pp. 16‚Äì17 The new Constitution would have also provided a Samoan language curriculum in the territory's educational system, and introduced a system for post-secondary education to American Samoa.Government of American Samoa, p. 8 Additionally, it would have established a Public Utilities and Services Commission for the territory, and mandated the enforcement of immigration laws \\"in order to protect the Samoan culture, lands and way of life\\".Government of American Samoa, p. 18 Campaigning and controversy Despite there being between 30 and 40 different proposed changes to the Constitution which had been approved at the Constitutional convention, all the changes were put to the polls together in a single-question referendum. Voters only had the choice to approve all or reject all the proposals, and could not vote on each one individually, resulting in criticism from voters. Governor Togiola Tulafono was accused of presenting it as a single question in the poll because he wanted approval for all the changes, a charge he denied. The decision to put all the changes on the ballot as a single question had been made by the chief elections officer, who claimed it was \\"the simplest way to put the question to voters.\\" Limited public campaigning took place on the issue of rejecting the constitutional referendum. In Tualauta County in the Western District, the most heavily populated county in American Samoa, there was reportedly concentrated lobbying against the referendum, which was defeated by 609 votes. The only other public campaigning occurred in Utulei and Tafuna, where a number of residents campaigned against the vote with an advertisement which centered around the decision of the chief elections officer to group all the proposed changes together. The advertisement complained that the amendments \\"should have been separated, item by item and placed individually on the ballot; they weren't\\". Voting The ballot contained the following sole question, printed in both English and Samoan in bold, block letters: \\"Do you approve the 2010 amendments to the Revised Constitution of American Samoa?\\" Voters had a choice of voting \\"yes\\" or \\"no\\". Official results Voters rejected the amendments to the Constitution in all 17 electoral districts of American Samoa as well as in the absentee ballot poll.

Barnett is best known for his promotional role during the 1920s and 1930s when bookplates enjoyed a resurgence of interest in Australasia, Europe, and the United States. He wrote, designed and privately published more than twenty limited-edition books.  Early life  Barnett was born on 13 September 1881 to Neville Barnett and his wife Mary Constance Isabel, in Christchurch, New Zealand. The family moved to Sydney in 1887 when Barnett's Anglican father was appointed organist at St. Mary's Cathedral. After finishing high school, Barnett worked at the Bank of New South Wales in Sydney. In 1918, he married Gabrielle Joyce Havelock Vidal, and it was around this time that his interest in book collecting and the scholarship of bookplates began.  Career  Barnett spent much of his life documenting the bookplate movement in Australia through his own publications. His books are rare as there were only limited copies available due to the high level of detail and craftsmanship put into each publication. Each book was often issued in both standard editions and small deluxe genuine colour-prints, each selected carefully and pasted by hand by Barnett himself. Barnett took great care in each publication, researching and collecting for up to nine of ten years for his most major works. Through both his personal collection and publications Barnett traced the subtle progress of the Australian bookplate tradition by analyzing their formal and stylistic development historically and aesthetically. Although they had been present in Australia from the very first days of European settlement, bookplates remained an expensive and exclusive item reserved only for the literati, missionaries, military officers, government officials and the occasional landed gentlemen. Up until the mid-1800s convicts in Australia accounted for about one third of the population; with low literacy levels in the British colonies, bookplates were reserved only for people who possessed personal libraries. Referring to Australia's slow start to the bookplate tradition, Barnett stated: In 1923 Barnett was becoming involved in the conception and formation of an Australian Bookplate Society. Prior to this Barnett had relied upon correspondence with European societies, clubs and individuals in keeping up to date with bookplate tradition. Barnett himself claimed that: With the idea of creating a bookplate society still in progress, the first public exhibition of bookplates in Tyrell's Galleries in Sydney took place on 18 May 1923. Artists and collectors came together to promote and enjoy bookplates and bookplate design, giving impetus to the official formation of the Australian Ex Libris Society with fifty foundation members. Barnett's dedication resulted in his positions as Honorary Secretary of the Australian Ex Libris Society, vice-president of the New Zealand Ex Libris Society and of the Book-plate Association International, Los Angeles. From 1931‚Äì37 he was general secretary of the Australian Painter- Etchers' Society.  Influence  Barnett witnessed the peak of the Australian Ex Libris movement of the 1920s and 1930s. In that time, thousands of individual bookplates were designed, and the concept of bookplates developed an Australian character. Following Barnett's success and involvement in the founding of the Australian Ex Libris Society, rival bookplate societies were established to better serve and support the growing needs of artists and collectors. Acknowledged for encouraging Australian artists to design bookplates, two of his most prominent inductions to the art of bookplate design were Lionel Lindsay and Pixie O'Harris. He encouraged artists and designers as a way of obtaining original and rare designs for his limited- edition books and personal collections. O'Harris, referring to the period between 1921 and 1922 recalled \\"About this time I became interested, through Percy Neville Barnett, in drawing bookplates‚Ä¶he encouraged me in this art.\\" Barnett also convinced artist Sydney Long, who had not produced a bookplate since 1921, to etch one as the frontispiece to Pictorial Book-plates (1931). It depicted a close copy of his iconic 1897 art nouveau oil painting The Spirit of the Plains. Encouraging the local industry, Barnett also directed substantial work toward the local book-plate designers. Commissioning Adrian Feint and George David Perrottet to design plates which were to be gifts to the Prince of Wales and Princess Elizabeth, and which would also be included in his Woodcut Book-plates (1934). The following year he also commissioned Feint and Perrottet to execute royal designs, this time for King George V and Queen Mary. Through efforts in commissions and promotion Barnett made a position for himself as an intermediary between prospective owners and artists.

He was the founding president of the Illinois State Board of Health. Rauch graduated in medicine from the University of Pennsylvania and settled in Burlington, Iowa. In 1850, on the organization of the Iowa State Medical Society, he was appointed to report on the \\"Medical and Economic Botany of Iowa,\\" and this report was afterward published (1851). He was an active member of the Iowa Historical and Geological Institute, and made a collection of material ‚Äî especially ichthyologic ‚Äî from the upper Mississippi and Missouri rivers for Prof. Louis Agassiz, a description of which was published in Silliman's Journal (1855). In 1857, he was appointed professor of materia medica and medical botany in Rush Medical College, Chicago, which chair he filled for the next three years. In 1859, he was one of the organizers of the Chicago College of Pharmacy and filled its chair of materia medica and medical botany. During the Civil War, he served as assistant medical director of the Army of Virginia, and then in Louisiana, until 1864. At the close of the war he was brevetted lieutenant-colonel. On his return to Chicago, Dr. Rauch published a pamphlet on \\"Intramural Interments in Populous Cities, and Their Influence Upon Health and Epidemics\\" (Chicago, 1866). He aided in reorganizing the health service of the city, and in 1867 was appointed member of the newly created board of health and sanitary superintendent, which office he filled until 1873. During his incumbency the great fire of 1871 occurred, and the task of organizing and enforcing the sanitary measures for the welfare of 112,000 houseless men, women, and children was suddenly thrown upon his department. In 1876 he was elected president of the American Public Health Association, and delivered the annual address on the \\"Sanitary Problems of Chicago\\" at the 1877 meeting of the association. In 1877, when the Illinois State Board of Health was created, Rauch was appointed one of its members, and elected its first president. He was elected secretary, to which office he had been re-elected annually for years. In 1878‚Äì79 the yellow fever epidemics in the southern United States engaged his attention, resulting in the formation of the Sanitary Council of the Mississippi Valley and the establishment of the River Inspection Service of the National Board of Health, inaugurated by Rauch in 1879. His investigations on the relation of smallpox to foreign immigration are embodied in an address before the National conference of state boards of health at St. Louis, 13 Oct., 1884, entitled \\"Practical Recommendations for the Exclusion and Prevention of Asiatic Cholera in North America\\" (Springfield, 1884). In 1887 he published the preliminary results of his investigations into the character of the water-supplies of Illinois. Rauch was a member of many scientific bodies and the author of monographs, chiefly in the domain of sanitary science and preventive medicine. His chief work as a writer is embodied in the reports of the Illinois State Board of Health in eight volumes. He was a recognized authority on medical education.

His work was halted while he served in the Red Army from 1931-1932, but throughout the rest of his life he was a leading figure in the engineering and construction of military technology for the Soviet Union. He was awarded the Order of Lenin in 1939 and the Lenin Prize in 1967. He died on November 20, 1975.  Technology produced  Silin produced a number of important weapons for the USSR, both through his own engineering work and under his direction. Working at the Central Bureau for the Construction and Research of Recreational and Hunting Weapons in Tula, he was tasked with developing antitank grenade launchers and was directly involved in the creation of the main weapons for the BMP-1 and BMD - 2A28 gun. In 1935, his involvement with the project led to the development of the 7.62 mm rapid-fire aircraft machine gun Sibemas (VI Silin, M. E. Berezin, P. Morozenko) with a rate of fire of 6,000 rounds/min which also features revolving scheme automation. Work on the design of such weapons was halted in the late 1940s, due to shortcomings in the design. In 1939 Silin participated in a competition to create a 7.62-mm machine gun. He developed the TCB-67 machine gun, which successfully passed field testing. Silin participated in the design of the VYa-23 and B-20 air cannons. In the late 40s - early 50s VI Silin developed the TKB-440 tank gun, equipped with a 7.62-mm rifle cartridge, as well as the TKB-458M with a 7,62 mm cartridge arr. 1943 In the 1950s.

As chief designer at the Central Bureau in Tula from 1960 until his death, Silin spearheaded the development of anti-tank grenade launchers. In 1960-1963. he, together with AT Alekseev developed the SPG-9 73-mm heavy machine grenade launcher, which is significantly faster than the best modern foreign models of similar value.

Background  A view of the Cheltenham Badlands, looking south-west The Cheltenham Badlands, sometimes referred to as the Chinguacousy Badlands, the Red Clay Hills, the Caledon Badlands, or the Inglewood Badlands, are located approximately 3.8 km west of highway 10 on Olde Base Line Road near the villages of Inglewood and Cheltenham. The northern boundary of the badlands site is Peel Regional Road 12 (Olde Base Line Road). The total area of the property is 36.6 hectaresBruce Trail Conservancy. (2012). Cheltenham Badlands Management Planning Background Information.https://brucetrail.org/system/downloads/0000/0730/Badlands_Background_Document_- _updated_October_2012.pdf and the exposed badlands occupies an area of approximately 0.4 square kilometers. The Badlands are considered part of the Niagara Escarpment, which was designated as a UNESCO World Biosphere Reserve in 1990. Acting as a buffer zone between the undeveloped and natural portions of the escarpment and the more developed areas further to the south, the badlands site is designated as an Escarpment Protection Area. Under the Niagara Escarpment Plan, the badlands are also considered an Escarpment Access Park and the main trail of the Bruce Trail system crosses the site and is the starting point for the Caledon Hills Bruce Trail Club section. In addition to being considered a Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry designated Earth Sciences Area of Natural Scientific Interest, the Cheltenham Badlands are also part of an important groundwater discharge area, the Inglewood Slope Environmentally Sensitive Area, designated by the Credit Valley Conservation Authority. The cold-water stream, located at the base of the badlands, is a tributary of the Credit River, which drains into Lake Ontario.  Geologic history of the Badlands  The Badlands are an exposed section of the Queenston Formation, which was formed between 420 and 415 million years ago during the Middle and Late Ordovician periods. During this period, the collision of Gondwana into Laurentia resulted in the formation of the Taconic Mountains. The creation of these mountains also resulted in several basins, such as the Appalachian Basin and the Michigan Basin, in the interior of Laurentia. Over time, the erosion of these mountains resulted in the formation of the Queenston Delta, which drained into the Michigan Basin. The deposition of mud eroded from the mountains during the Middle and Late Ordovician period formed the Queenston Shale. The continuous deposition of the mud and sand from the mountains extended the Queenston Delta further into the Michigan Basin; however, as the mountains continued to erode, less and less mud and sand reached the delta, resulting in the formation of inter-layered beds of sandstone, shale and limestone throughout the Silurian period. These inter- layered beds that overlay the Queenston Shale include Lower Silurian sandstones, such as the Whirlpool Formation, and dolostones, such as the Manitoulin Formation, which can be seen along the Niagara Escarpment. The Queenston Shale overlies the shales and the inter-bedded limestones of the Georgian Bay Formation. At the badlands site, glacial erosion of the overlaying sandstones and dolostones has caused the Queenston Formation to be the first layer of rock to underlie the soil.  The Queenston Formation  The Queenston Formation is characterized by its brick red to maroon shales which are interlaced with smaller amounts of green shale, sandstone, and limestone. The darker red shale is the result of introduction of the terrestrial muddy deposits into the Queenston Delta. The shale beds are thin and fractured, with a structural dip westward towards the center of the Michigan Basin. Shales in the Queenston Formation are considered to have high density, low cation exchange capacities, and low water content. The lighter red shale, which sits on top of the darker shale, is highly bioturbated and is composed of a combination of bioclasts and the reworked pieces of the darker shale below. The distinct red, due to iron-oxide, coloring of these rocks is broken up with green-grey bands. The green-grey bands are thought to be caused by a change in the oxidation rate due to circulating groundwater or bleaching by acidic groundwater. The lithology of the lighter and darker red shales at the Cheltenham Badlands site is categorized as smectite-poor, due to the clay content, ranging from 58% to 68% clay, and the dominant clay minerals, illite and chlorite. The non-swelling illite in the shales can cause high pressures with repeated wetting and drying, resulting in failure of the shale structures. The difference in the water absorption between illite and chlorite clay minerals can cause differences in swelling which results in larger shards of the shales breaking into smaller shards. Once the shards are reduced to tiny and flaky shards, they become compacted and smooth, however, surface cracks during drying periods can lead to further erosion.  Formation of the Badlands = Land use  In the late 1800s and early 1900s, the Cheltenham Badlands property was used for agricultural purposes, predominantly cattle grazing. Farming practices ceased on the property in 1931 and natural recovery of the majority of the property lands began. Once established, this type of erosion continues rapidly, particularly if land clearing, over-grazing, and increased foot traffic by humans persists, since the shale itself is highly susceptible to erosion.Guillet, J.R. (1977). Clay and Shale Deposits of Ontario, Ontario Geological Survey, Mineral Deposits Circular MDC15. http://www.geologyontario.mndm.gov.on.ca/mndmfiles/pub/data/imaging/MDC015//MDC015.pdf The main section of Badlands remains devoid of vegetation due to the high amount of human traffic during the warmer months; however the less traveled areas, such as the area to the north-west have more vegetation. A section of the main Bruce Trail has been on the property since 1989 after permission for the trail was granted by the owner. A side trail, named the Russell Cooper side trail, connected the main trail to the unofficial viewing area located at the top of the site near Olde Base Line Road, was open from 2001 to 2007. The side trail was closed due to concerns of erosion of the path and maintenance issues.  Geomorphological features  The Cheltenham Badlands present a unique opportunity to observe the Queenston Formation and the effects of land degradation and denudation processes. The badlands consist of predominantly red-colored shale, which has been eroded into smooth faced gullies and hills. The hummocky rills and gullies that dominate this area are formed by ephemeral streams that drain melt water and storm water from the areas of higher elevation into the stream below. These rills and gullies are important geomorphological features in clay-rich badlands areas. Additionally, the clay near the surface expands and contracts, due to variations in moisture and in temperature, which leads to further erosion. From 1973 to 2009 the maximum degradation of the badlands site was found to be up to 3.2 meters and the average annual rates of denudation vary between 0.7 and 2.5 centimeters per year across the site. There is a high drainage density in this area, with three primary drainage areas. Slopes in the upper areas of the site are steeper that those near the lower areas of the site, primarily due to infilling from transported and deposited eroded material. The gullies in the lower parts of the site have become stabilized due to continued erosion and deposition of materials. Conservation of the Badlands= Ownership  The Cheltenham Badlands property was purchased in 1870 by George Wilson until 1877. The next known owner of the property was Russell Cooper who purchased the property in 1929. The property was held by the Cooper family until 1989, when the family had indicated a desire to sell the property. The property was listed for acquisition through the Natural Areas Protection Program in 1999. The Cheltenham Badlands property was purchased for $500,000 by the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources in 2000 and placed under the Niagara Escarpment Parks and Open Spaces System. Ownership of the property was transferred to the Ontario Heritage Trust in 2002. The Bruce Trail Conservancy and the Credit Valley Conservation Authority was made responsible for the managing the site.  Badlands conservation  352x352px As part of the management plan for the site, an erosion study of the badlands was conducted between 2009 and 2010 to provide an assessment of the erosion processes and rates at the site, as well as a framework for future monitoring. The erosion study provided two key findings that have directed management of the site: * Compression of the soil by foot traffic is not reducing erosion. * Human foot traffic in the heavily visited site may account for up to 10% of the annual sediment loss and denudation of the site area. Some of the additional concerns pertaining to management of the site included: * Concerns over public safety along the road beside the site, due to the number of cars parked alongside the road and the volume of visitors. * Garbage and littering. * Destruction of trail signs and structures. * Creation of additional \\"rogue\\" trails on the property. * Generalized impacts of pedestrian, equestrian, and wheeled traffic on the slopes of the badlands site. On May 6, 2015, the Ontario Heritage Trust announced that the Badlands site would be closed to visitors for several years at the end of May, due to the excessive number of visitors who were walking on the formations, causing damage that accelerated the erosion. In July 2015 the Badlands were fenced off and closed to visitors; marked \\"no trespassing\\" and the parking areas were changed to no parking and tow away zones. The closure was indicated as temporary as a public consultation and master plan study was underway. The area re-opened on September 22, 2018. The newly re-opened site features an accessible boardwalk, new trail head and way-finding signs, and a new parking area has been created to manage traffic concerns and provide safe public access to the site. Educational signs were also added to the site as part of the Visitor Infrastructure Improvement project, which began in 2017.

The forest has small shared borders with the Chippewa National Forest to the north, and the Hill River State Forest to east. Over half of the forest's land is managed by the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources; the remaining land is managed by Cass County or is privately held. History and overview The land of the forest was originally covered in old-growth Eastern White and Red Pine, which was logged between 1800 and 1890 by several large timber companies. Originally, logs were driven to sawmills downstream in the Mississippi River via Mitchell Lake. The intensity of logging was increased by the implementation of a railroad grade in 1890 by the Simpson Logging Company. The remaining old-growth pine was logged on the holdings of the Pine Tree Lumber Company, a subsidiary of Weyerhaeuser, in 1907. Natural reforestation was stagnated after the original harvests due to a high incidence of wildfires, which ceased in the 1930s. Aspen and paper birch are now the dominant species, although pine, northern hardwoods, and deciduous and coniferous lowland species are scattered through the forest. Recreation Popular outdoor recreational activities such as boating, canoeing, kayaking, and swimming are available on the Washburn Lake, and other smaller lakes accessible from the forest. The main campsite of the forest was built by the Civilian Conservation Corps during the forest's establishment in 1933. Trails are designated for hiking, with specifically designated for cross-country skiing in the wintertime, and designated for Class I and II all-terrain vehicle use.

Overview In accordance with the Commandant's Planning Guidance, the WWR continues to enhance its capabilities to provide added care and support to our WII Marines. In just a few years, the WWR has quickly become a proven command providing WII Marines, their families, and caregivers support to help them through the processes of recovery and transition. The Marine Corps care model is unique in that its approach is to ensure recovering Marines return to their units as quickly as their medical conditions will allow. Whether WII Marines are joined to the WWR or remain with their operational units, the WWR provides non-medical care and support. Allowing Marines to \\"stay in the fight\\" is what makes the Marine Corps care model successful. During its course of caring for WII Marines, the WWR has confirmed that their needs are varied and highly dependent upon many factors, to include the acuity of the Marine's wound, illness, or injury; his or her family support system; and the phase and location of their recovery. WII Marines and their families are a highly unique population and they must receive programs and services proportionate to their needs. There is no \\"one size fits all\\" response to warrior care. The world of warrior care is never static and the WWR evolves its structure to ensure that WII Marines and families receive individualized care, proportionate to their existing needs. The Regiment achieves this individualized care by synergizing its internal assets with the appropriate external assets (e.g., federal agencies and private organizations) around the essential point of focus: the mind, body, spirit, and family of the WII Marine. Under this concept, WII Marines are provided leadership and motivation, care coordination, and transition counsel. This ensures their recovery periods are productive and at the end of their recoveries, they are postured for success; whether they return to duty or transition to their civilian communities. History The Wounded Warrior Regiment grew from the 2005 Marine For Life ill/injured support section and the 2004 Wounded Warrior barracks on several bases. During his 2006 Planning Guidance, the 34th Commandant of the Marine Corps General James T. Conway highlighted his vision of taking care of wounded warriors and their families. The official establishment of the regiment took place in April 2007. Support Assets ‚Ä¢ Marine leaders: Leaders play a key role in motivating their Marines to meet their established recovery goals. The WWR ensures its leaders have the specific training, tools, and information they need to help their WII Marines make sound decisions. ‚Ä¢ Recovery Care Coordinators (RCCs): RCCs serve as the WII Marine‚Äôs resource subject matter expert to help them define and meet their individual goals for recovery, rehabilitation, and reintegration, and to identify the services needed to achieve these goals. RCCs regularly meet with members of their Marines‚Äô recovery teams to improve care delivery and ensure goals stay on track. ‚Ä¢ Medical Section: The WWR headquarters has a Medical Section that advises the Commanding Officer regarding medical issues and emerging technologies and treatments impacting WII Marines. The section includes a Regimental Surgeon, Mental Health Advisor, Nurse Case Manager, Psychological Health Program Coordinator, Traumatic Brain Injury Program Coordinator, and Licensed Clinical Consultants. Together, this team works with public and private medical providers to ensure the best care for WII Marines, particularly in the areas of post-traumatic stress and traumatic brain injury. ‚Ä¢ Warrior Athlete Reconditioning Program: Under this program (which is mandatory for all Marines joined to the WWR, but tailored to accommodate their medical limitations), Marines engage in both physical and cognitive activities outside the traditional therapy setting. Activities are individualized to the WII Marines‚Äô needs, and encompass more than 20 sports and activities. Both in individual or team settings, this adaptive sports program greatly improves WII Marines‚Äô overall physical and mental fitness. ‚Ä¢ Chaplain Services: The mission of the WWR Chaplain is to provide spiritual and emotional care to WII Marines, their families, and staff. The WWR has chaplains located at the Regiment, its Battalions, and Landstuhl, Germany. ‚Ä¢ Job Transition Cell: To enhance community reintegration for WII Marines who will not return to duty, the WWR‚Äôs Job Transition Cell (manned by Marines and representatives of the Departments of Labor and Veterans Affairs) proactively reaches out to identify employers and job training programs to help them obtain positions where they are most likely to succeed and enjoy promising careers. ‚Ä¢ Sergeant Merlin German Wounded Warrior Call Center: The Call Center, dedicated to a fallen Marine who was severely injured in a roadside blast in Iraq in February 2005, is a 24/7 operation that conducts outreach calls to Marines and Marine veterans to determine if their needs are being met, offer assistance, and follow-on monitoring to ensure issue resolution. Additionally, the Call Center receives calls for assistance. The Call Center‚Äôs toll-free number is 1-877-487-6299. The Call Center also serves as the Regiment‚Äôs hub for social media outreach to include Facebook and Twitter. ‚Ä¢ District Injured Support Coordinators (DISCs): DISCs are mobilized Reserve Marines who are located throughout the country to conduct face-to-face visits and telephone outreach to WII Marines and their families who are recovering within their assigned region. ‚Ä¢ Family Support Staff: The WWR‚Äôs Family Support Staff includes Family Readiness Officers and Family Support Coordinators who provide care to the families of WII Marines throughout multiple phases of recovery and in geographically dispersed locations. ‚Ä¢ Integrated Disability Evaluation System (IDES) Support: The WWR has Regional Limited Duty Coordinators who help Marines processing through the IDES and Wounded Warrior Attorneys who advise and support WII Marines through this process. ‚Ä¢ Wounded Warrior Hope and Care Centers: The Centers will be located at Camp Pendleton, CA (opening fall 2011) and Camp Lejeune, NC (opening summer 2012). These facilities will provide ‚Äúone-stop‚Äù services for wounded warriors and their families, such as counseling, employment and transition support, physical training and therapy, the Warrior Athlete Reconditioning Program, and examination rooms. The Hope and Care Centers complement additional military construction efforts to build and renovate barracks, family housing, hospitals and other administrative support to the Marine Corps‚Äô Wounded Warrior Program. Sergeant Merlin German Wounded Warrior Call Center Sergeant Merlin German was deployed to Iraq with 2nd Battalion 11th Marines when he was wounded in the detonation of an improvised explosive device on February 21, 2005. With burns over 97 percent of his body, he was given only a three percent chance of survival, but lived for more than three years in recovery. He regained his ability to walk, purchased a home, and actively participated in founding and forming the Merlin's Miracles charity organization designated to help child burn victims. At the age of 22 on April 11, 2008, German died of surgical complications. In 2008, Wounded Warrior Regiment officials held an unveiling ceremony to rename their call center in Dumfries, Virginia the ‚ÄúSgt. Merlin German Wounded Warrior Call Center‚Äù in his honor. The call center started operations in December 2007 and handled more than 35,000 cases in the first year of operations. The mission of the call center is to empower the Marine Corps to provide support to Marines 24-7 to include advocacy, resource identification and referral, information distribution, and care coordination for wounded, ill or injured Marines and their families.

The Council stated that the reconstruction of Haiti was crucial to long-term security and stability, and that it should go hand in hand with economic and social development. Donors were urged to fulfil their pledges towards Haiti at a conference on March 31, 2010. The Organization of American States (OAS) was praised for its efforts towards electoral preparations. There were concerns about the increasing number of weapons in circulation, drug trafficking and security in refugee camps. The Council recognised that respect for human rights, combating crime and sexual violence, and ending impunity were essential in maintaining order. In addition, the presence of MINUSTAH peacekeepers and the United Nations was critical to security and stability in Haiti. It welcomed the efforts of former United States President Bill Clinton as the United Nations Special Envoy for Haiti. Acts Acting under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, the mandate of MINUSTAH was extended until October 15, 2011 with 8,940 troops and 4,391 police, with the intention of further renewal. The resolution determined that Haiti and its people were ultimately responsible for the stabilisation of the country, and free and fair elections were an important prerequisite. MINUSTAH was required to continue various activities in Haiti, including training of the Haitian National Police, tackling crime, protecting human rights, judicial reform and activities to enhance trust of the Haitian population towards MINUSTAH. The Council condemned violence against children and abuse of women and girls and requested the Secretary- General Ban Ki-moon to pay attention to the issue in his future reports on the situation in Haiti.
